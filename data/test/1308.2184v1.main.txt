## Chapter 1 introduction

Thirty years of active research in Pulsars have made it abundantly clear
that these objects are veritable laboratories for testing out theories
for exotic physics stretching far beyond the limits of present day
terrestrial experiments. Indeed, the 1967 discovery of the first pulsar
by Hewish and his group in Cambridge has been one of the major events in
recent astronomy [ Hewish et al.Hewish et al.1968 ] . Pulsars,
characterized by the regular pulses of radiation observed to be coming
from them, are actually strongly magnetized neutron stars rotating very
rapidly. The concept of neutron stars, of course, has been around for
about thirty years before this discovery, almost from the day the
neutron was detected for the first time. It is said that the day the
news of the discovery of neutrons reached Landau, he hypothesized on the
possible existence of stars made up entirely of neutrons. Barely two
years after this, \citeN baad34 in their seminal paper propounded the
theory of the possible birth of neutron stars in the most violent and
spectacular event of stellar death, that of a supernova explosion.

There has always been a great interest in the ultimate fate of the
stars. Before the advent of Fermi-Dirac statistics, it was inconceivable
as to how a star could escape the final collapse at the hands of gravity
when it exhausts its nuclear fuel - a view expounded by Sir Arthur
Eddington. But the work of \citeN chan31c proved conclusively that the
final gravitational collapse could be halted when the stellar material
becomes Fermi-degenerate due to extreme compression so that the
degeneracy pressure is sufficient to withhold gravity. In this work the
case of electron-degeneracy and the end state of stars that we know of
as white dwarfs has been discussed. Soon afterwards the companion of
Sirius was identified as a white dwarf which vindicated the existence of
such degenerate end stages of stars. The logical extension of
Chandrasekhar’s argument is, of course, the state when the neutrons
become degenerate. And that is the state found in neutron stars.

Even before the discovery of pulsars, \citeN paci67 suggested that the
Crab Nebula must be powered by a rotating neutron star. The Crab Nebula
is the remnant of the supernova of A.D. 1054, recorded by the Chinese.
The later identification of the Crab Pulsar with the neutron star
associated with the supernova gave the first direct proof of Baade &
Zwicky’s hypothesis. Lately, the attention has been focussed on the most
spectacular supernova of recent times, SN1987A, a supernova that went
off in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small companion galaxy of the Milky
Way, in February 1987. But even after a decade of intense search the
neutron star that is supposed to be there has remained elusive. This, in
all probability, means a modification of the theory of neutron star
formation in supernovae. Of course, supernovae may not be the only way
of neutron star formation. Recently, particularly in connection with the
possible ways of millisecond pulsar formation, the theory of
accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf into a neutron star has been
advocated. Even if that does happen in certain systems, supernovae would
still most likely be the major route through which the neutron stars are
born. As a star of main-sequence mass @xmath explodes at the end of its
life, it throws away most of its mass and the object that is left behind
is a neutron star of mass of about @xmath with a radius of ten
kilometers. Evidently the formation of this ultra-compact object is
accompanied by a release of a tremendous amount of energy ( @xmath erg)
equal to the binding energy of it. And this is the energy that powers
the fantastic fireworks of a supernova.

The initial interest in neutron stars, surprisingly, arose due to the
discovery of certain intense radio emitters. The large values of
red-shift associated with these objects made one think that these could
be neutron stars producing highly red-shifted radiation due to the large
value of their surface gravity. That idea died its natural death when
quasars were discovered. Then in 1967 pulsars were discovered almost
serendipitously, by Jocelyn Bell, a graduate student working with
Anthony Hewish on interplanetary scintillation [ Hewish et al.Hewish
et al.1968 ] . Understandably, the first signals from the neutron star,
due to their extreme regular periodicity, were suspected to have been
signatures of the ’little green men’. But all such highly speculative
theories and their more sober counterparts quickly settled to an
identification of these objects as neutron stars [ GoldGold1968 ,
GoldGold1969 ] . The signals were understood to have originated due to
the fast rotation of the neutron stars possessing very large magnetic
fields (canonical value of the field being B @xmath Gauss). Extremely
compact objects were required to explain the rapidity of the pulses (
@xmath ) and the obvious candidates were the neutron stars and the white
dwarfs. Discovery of fast pulsars like Crab and Vela (with rotation
periods of 33 and 89 ms respectively) excluded the possibility of these
being white dwarfs (as they would not be gravitationally stable at such
high rates of rotation) and the identification of pulsars with neutron
stars was conclusively established [ GoldGold1968 , GoldGold1969 , Gunn
& OstrikerGunn & Ostriker1969 , PaciniPacini1968 ] .

Pulsars are characterized by their pulsed emission and the precise
periodicity of these pulses, though the shape and the amplitude of the
pulse profiles vary widely. The mechanism of the radio emission still
remains one of the important unsolved problems of pulsar physics, though
the basic ideas were laid down quite early on by \citeN ostr69. In this
model of magnetic dipole pulsar emission is derived from the kinetic
energy of a rotating neutron star. It is assumed that a neutron star
rotates uniformly in vacuum at a frequent @xmath and has a dipole moment
m at an angle @xmath to the axis of rotation. The dipole field at the
magnetic pole of the star, @xmath , is related to m by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the radius of the star. This oblique rotator
configuration has a time-varying dipole moment as seen from infinity and
therefore radiates energy at a rate

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (1.2)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

This energy carried away changes the kinetic energy producing a
slow-down torque on the star given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the moment of inertia of the star. Using equation [ 1.2
] and [ 1.3 ] one obtains an estimate of the magnetic field in terms of
the period and the rate of change of the period of the star, which are
measurable with high accuracy from the timing of the arriving pulses.
Thus, the magnetic field is given by the expression [ Manchester &
TaylorManchester & Taylor1977 ]

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where, @xmath are the period and the period derivative, @xmath is the
moment of inertia and @xmath is the radius of the star. There are
problems with this simple model. Firstly, as far as the emission is
concerned, this mechanism does not work in case of an aligned rotator.
Refined theories dealing with the problem of emission for an aligned
rotator have come into existence since then. And this simple estimate of
the magnetic field provides a measure of the dipole component only,
without any handle on the total field. Yet, this is still the most
widely used and in most cases the only means of estimating the magnetic
field. There have been a few direct measurements of the field, like that
from the cyclotron line-strength of Her X-1, which gave the field
strength of this neutron star to be @xmath Gauss [ Truemper
et al.Truemper et al.1978 ] . But the scope of such direct measurement
is limited only to the case of X-ray binaries. For radio pulsars no
method for a direct measurement of the field exists.

With the discovery of a new variety of pulsar by Backer et al. \citeyear
back82 another horizon in the pulsar research opened up. From now on the
radio pulsars were divided into two distinct classes with very different
physical characteristics. The new variety were named millisecond pulsars
as these have very small rotation periods, in the range of milliseconds.
The first one observed, PSR1937+21, had a period of 1.6 ms. Also they
were found to have extremely short (compared to the earlier-observed
normal pulsars) magnetic fields in the range of @xmath Gauss. In all
some seven hundred pulsars have been observed to date. Figure [ 1.1 ]
shows a histogram for the periods of all these pulsars. The period
distribution is clearly bimodal, with most of the occupants of the peak
at short periods being millisecond pulsars. One must admit here that the
definition of millisecond pulsars is somewhat ad hoc, defined as the
ones with spin periods less than @xmath . Still the division serves
quite well due to the fact that these two sets, as far as present
understanding goes, do have very different past histories. We make a
crude comparison of these two classes of pulsars here in order to
highlight the differences.

  properties       normal pulsars    millisecond pulsars
  ---------------- ----------------- ---------------------
  spin period      @xmath ms         @xmath ms
  magnetic field   @xmath Gauss      @xmath Gauss
  age              @xmath yrs        @xmath yrs
  binarity         mostly isolated   mostly in binaries

The most striking difference is, of course, the fact that whereas the
normal pulsars are mostly isolated, some 90% of the disk population and
about 50% of the Globular Cluster population of the millisecond pulsars
are in binaries. The age determination of some of the millisecond
pulsars are possible also due to that fact. From the surface temperature
of the white dwarf companion it has been possible to put a lower limit
to the age of a few millisecond pulsars which lies in the range of
@xmath years [ Callanan et al.Callanan et al.1989 , Kulkarni,
Djorgovski, & KlemolaKulkarni et al.1991 ] . On the other hand, in the
case of normal pulsars it is basically the spin-down age estimated from
the rate of change of the period which turn out to be a few million
years at most. To emphasize the remarkable binary-millisecond pulsar
association we draw here a Venn-diagram in figure [ 1.2 ] showing the
nature of the pulsars, their binary association and the population (disk
or globular cluster) to which they belong.

It has been observed that, in general, the binary pulsars have lower
fields than the isolated pulsars. In figures [ 1.3 ] and [ 1.4 ] we have
plotted the histograms of the field strengths of in these two categories
separately.This fact was evident even in the first binary pulsar to be
discovered, the famous PSR1913+16 discovered by \citeN huls75. It was
\citeN bisn74 who suggested for the first time a connection between the
decay of the magnetic field in a neutron star and its binary
association. \citeN taam86 provided observational support to this idea.
In the early eighties the idea of recycled pulsars was forwarded in this
connection [ Srinivasan & van den HeuvelSrinivasan & van den Heuvel1982
, Radhakrishnan & SrinivasanRadhakrishnan & Srinivasan1982 , Alpar
et al.Alpar et al.1982 ] . According to this scenario an otherwise
normal pulsar, at the end of its normal lifetime, could be resurrected
with a reduced magnetic field and a spun-up period if it is processed in
a binary. One of the problems faced by the theory of recycled pulsars is
that of explaining the isolated low-field and millisecond pulsars.
\citeN rudr89 suggested that the companion could perhaps be ablated by
the intense radiation falling on it from the pulsar. Soon afterwards
PSR1957+20 (another 1.6 ms pulsar) was caught in the act of vaporising
its companion [ Fruchter, Stinebring, & TaylorFruchter et al.1988 ] . So
that immediately confirmed this conjecture, although later on doubts
have been raised regarding the efficacy of this method to completely
destroy the companion. Yet, the connection between a reduction of the
field strength and a binary history has remained well endorsed by
observations. Though the theory of ‘recycling’ has its problems, to date
this has been the most successful in explaining the population of the
low-field and millisecond pulsars by integrating them with the class of
normal pulsars through their binary history.

In order to develop a proper theory of the evolution of the magnetic
field it is essential to understand the nature of the internal current
configuration supporting the observed field. This also requires an
accurate knowledge of the internal structure of the neutron stars which
determines the long-term behaviour of the embedded current loops and
hence the time-evolution of the magnetic field. Roughly, the neutron
star has two physically different regions - the crust and the core. The
crust is the outer shell, about a kilometer thick, which is a
crystalline solid made up of neutron rich nuclei. In this region the
density changes by some eight orders of magnitude, going from @xmath at
the very surface, to @xmath at the boundary of the crust and the core [
Pandharipande, Pines, & SmithPandharipande et al.1976 ] . Underneath
this crust lies the region with an average density of nuclear density or
more, which is believed to have superfluid neutrons along with
superconducting protons and extremely relativistic, Fermi degenerate
electrons [ LattimerLattimer1992 , Pines & AlparPines & Alpar1992 ] .
There is a lot of controversy about the exact composition of the core,
opinions ranging from normal n-p-e plasma to exotic quark-condensates [
HanawaHanawa1992 , Lattimer et al.Lattimer et al.1991 ,
PethickPethick1992 , PrakashPrakash1994 , Tatsumi & MutoTatsumi &
Muto1992 ] , but the above-mentioned picture is what is generally
accepted at present.

Regarding the generation of the magnetic field in the neutron stars,
there are two possibilities. The field could be a fossil field. The
original magnetic field of the progenitor of the neutron star could be
enhanced to large values by flux conservation during compactification of
the large star to neutron star dimensions. As one believes the core to
become superfluid soon after formation and in particular the protons
form a type II superconductor, the field would be supported by the
proton superconducting flux tubes in this case. But there are problems
with this scenario. Firstly, there are no good measurements for the core
field of the massive stars, so it is not certain whether the field
strength required to enhance it to the pulsars field values really
obtain in the progenitor core. On the other hand, in an extremely
violent process like a supernova explosion, whether an adiabatic process
like flux conservation would hold good is not clearly understood. The
other possibility is that of the generation of the field after the birth
of the neutron star. \citeN blnd83 pointed out that it is possible to
generate a field in the crust of a cooling neutron star due to
thermo-magnetic instabilities as the heat flows in presence of a seed
field. This mechanism, again, suffers from the fact that a seed field of
the order of @xmath Gauss is required in order to produce the canonical
field values that are observed in neutron stars. Though none of the
theories are free from hitches, for want of better alternatives, these
are accepted as the best possibilities for the origin of the field in
neutron stars.

It is, of course, obvious that the evolution of the field would itself
depend on the generation mechanism, which determines the underlying
configuration of currents. Initially, observational data appeared to
indicate that the pulsar magnetic fields decay with a time constant of
@xmath years [ Gunn & OstrikerGunn & Ostriker1970 , Lyne, Anderson, &
SalterLyne et al.1982 ] On the other hand, it was shown by \citeN
baym69c that given the state of matter in a neutron star the electrical
conductivity is expected to be extremely high and the ohmic dissipation
time-scale should be larger than the Hubble time. It was borne out by
some recent statistical work [ Bhattacharya et al.Bhattacharya
et al.1992 , Hartman et al.Hartman et al.1997 ] , where they showed that
the magnetic field of the isolated pulsars indeed do not show any
significant decay. An investigation of the association of the field
decay and a binary history therefore becomes extremely pertinent. In the
past few years a considerable amount of effort has been spent in trying
to find the answer to this question (for details see \citeNP bhat95 and
references therein). The basic understanding in this regard could be
divided into two classes. The underlying physics of the field evolution
in a binary is that of the ohmic dissipation of the current loops in the
accretion-heated crust. Therefore, for the believers in crustal field,
the current dissipates due to an increase in temperature as mass is
accreted by the neutron star from its companion in the course of binary
evolution. When one assumes an initial core field configuration, a phase
of spin-down driven flux-expulsion is necessary prior to the phase of
the ohmic dissipation in the crust. Both these ideas have been explored
in detail by a multitude of researchers (for a review see \citeNP db95a)
yet by no means have all the questions been answered.

Therefore, fifteen years after the discovery of the millisecond pulsars
there still remains a lot of uncertainties regarding their possible past
history. On a broader perspective the scenarios for both the generation
and the evolution of magnetic fields of neutron stars lack a consensus.
A coherent theoretical picture is yet to emerge. In such a situation,
the observational data is the only guide. In this thesis, therefore, we
have tried to address a few questions related to the evolution of the
magnetic field of neutron stars that are members of binary systems. We
try to make connection with the overall picture of the field evolution
as indicated by observational data. In particular we look into the
problem of the generation of millisecond pulsar from particular kind of
binary systems. To this end we have looked at four related problems as
described below :

-   the effect of diamagnetic screening on the final field of a neutron
    star accreting material from its binary companion;

-   evolution of magnetic flux located in the crust of an accreting
    neutron star;

-   application of the above-mentioned model to real systems and a
    comparison with observations;

-   an investigation into the consequences of magnetic flux being
    initially located in the core of the star and its observational
    implications.

Here then is a brief resume of the problems mentioned above.

1.  The effect of diamagnetic screening - The basic idea is that the
    magnetic field is screened due to the stream of the accreting
    material that arrives at the polar cap, being channeled by the
    strong magnetic field of the star. A screening of the external
    dipole field, in this case, is achieved by the production of
    horizontal components at the cost of poloidal ones. If
    fluid-interchange instabilities are ignored then the field lines are
    frozen to the material (since the flow time-scales are very much
    smaller than the diffusive time-scales) and as the accreted material
    spreads over the surface it drags the field lines along. The field
    lines would then reconnect on the equatorial plane and get buried.
    Before this field can diffuse out more matter will come and spread
    on top of it, and push the field to even deeper regions. Finally the
    field may even reach the superconducting core from where it will not
    diffuse out. But whether such burial is at all possible depends on
    the relative magnitude of the time-scales of flow, diffusion and
    interchange instability. This question has already been addressed
    before, and the calculations made by us re-assert the fact that the
    fluid-interchange time-scales are too small for the burial of the
    field to be effective since any stretching of the field lines is
    quickly restored over this overturn time-scale. Therefore the cause
    of the low field observed in some neutron stars in X-ray binaries or
    in millisecond pulsars can not be due to a simple screening of their
    magnetic field by the accreted matter.

2.  Evolution of a crustal magnetic flux under accretion - This
    investigation is carried out assuming the underlying currents,
    supporting the observed field, to be entirely confined to the crust
    of the neutron star to start with. The main mechanism responsible
    for the field decay here is the ohmic dissipation of the current
    loops in the accretion-heated crust. The evolution is investigated
    for a wide range of values of the relevant physical parameters, such
    as the rate of accretion, the depth of current carrying layers etc.
    We find that within a reasonable range of parameter values final
    fields in the correct range for millisecond pulsars are produced. A
    most important feature has been seen to arise due to the inward
    material movement of the crustal layers because of accreted
    overburden. The current loops reach the region of very high
    conductivity in the deeper and denser regions of the star by such
    material movement and this puts a stop to further field decay. This
    freezing in behaviour that comes naturally out of the input physics,
    is very important in explaining the limiting field values observed
    in binary and millisecond pulsars. Therefore, within the limits of
    uncertainty this model, besides providing for an effective mechanism
    for field reduction by the right order of magnitude, also gives an
    explanation for the lower bound of the field observed in millisecond
    pulsars.

3.  Comparison with observations - Here we investigate the evolution of
    the magnetic field of neutron stars in its entirety – in case of the
    isolated pulsars as well as in different kinds of binary systems,
    assuming the field to be originally confined in the crust. A
    comparison of our results for the field evolution in isolated
    neutron stars with observational data helps us constrain the
    physical parameters of the crust. We also model the full evolution
    of a neutron star in a binary system through several stages of
    interaction. Initially there is no interaction between the
    components of the binary and the evolution of the neutron star is
    similar to that of an isolated one. It then interacts with the
    stellar wind of the companion and finally a phase of heavy mass
    transfer ensues through Roche-lobe overflow. We model the field
    evolution through all these stages and compare the resulting final
    field strength with that observed in neutron stars in various types
    of binary systems. One of the interesting aspects of our result is a
    positive correlation between the rate of accretion and the final
    field strength. Recently there has been observational indications
    for such a correlation. Our results also match with the overall
    picture of the field evolution in neutron stars. In particular, the
    generation of millisecond pulsars from low-mass binaries arises as a
    natural consequence of the general framework.

4.  Lastly, we look at the outcome of spindown-induced expulsion of
    magnetic flux originally confined to the core, in which case the
    expelled flux undergoes ohmic decay. We model this decay of the
    expelled flux. Once again we look into the nature of field evolution
    – both for neutron stars that are isolated and are members of binary
    systems. This scenario of field evolution could also explain the
    observed field strength of neutron stars but only if the crustal
    lattice contains a large amount of impurity. At present both the
    scenarios (assuming an original crustal field and an expelled flux)
    appear to be consistent with the observations though they require
    rather different assumptions regarding the state of the matter in
    the crusts of the neutron stars. Also, the detailed predictions in
    the two scenarios are different. Therefore future observations, able
    to pin down these details, should distinguish between the two
    models. On the other hand, with an unambiguous determination of the
    state of the matter in the neutron star crust, at some future date,
    it will again be possible to arrive at a definitive conclusion
    regarding the model of field evolution that actually prevails in
    neutron stars.

Improved observational techniques have produced a wealth of data in the
recent past which requires an accurate and detailed understanding of
pulsar physics. Unfortunately, the regime in which the physical theories
are lacking are precisely the regimes in which the neutron stars are the
only available systems. And the data, though enormous, still remain
inadequate for answering such questions unambiguously. The handicap is
many-faceted, like the uncertainty in the form of a nucleon-nucleon
interaction potential or the inadequacy of the quantum many body
techniques to handle the nuclear density systems. Even though the basic
picture of field reduction via ohmic dissipation is on secure grounds
there are still many uncertainties, for example due to uncertainties in
:

-   the crustal structure, in particular regarding the exact forms of
    the nuclei,

-   the transport properties arising due to a lack of proper knowledge
    of the impurity concentration or the dislocations that exist in the
    crust,

-   the change in the composition due to accretion, since the
    newly-formed accreted crust do not contain cold-catalysed matter
    like the original crust, or

-   the thermal behaviour in both isolated and accreting neutron star.

As for the generation of the millisecond pulsars, quite apart from the
birthrate problem, all the model calculations also suffer from
uncertainties in the binary evolution.

If the physics of these are understood a lot of accepted wisdom may
change. Refined many-body calculations of proton superconductivity has
already cast doubts on the magnetic field being supported by the
fluxoids threading the core [ Ainsworth, Wambach, & PinesAinsworth
et al.1989 ] . Therefore to understand the basic problems at least
within the standard premises one needs to have a second look at the
problems incorporating all the new refinements that have been coming in.
That seems to be the next logical step. On a different level, new and
exotic physics is making inroads like the Strange stars being put
forward as possible pulsar candidates [ Cheng & DaiCheng & Dai1997 ] .
Those probably would start the new era of pulsar research.

This thesis has been organized as follows. In chapter 2, we review the
basics of neutron star physics, aspects that we have needed for our
calculations. Chapter 3 discusses the standard scenario for the
generation and evolution of neutron star magnetic fields. In chapters 4
to 7 we describe the details of the four problems that have been worked
on. Finally in chapter 8 we have made our conclusions along with a
discussion of the uncertainties inherent in these investigations and the
possible future directions of work along these lines.

## Chapter 2 microphysics of neutron stars

### 2.1 equation of state of dense matter

The conditions in the interior of Neutron Stars are more extreme than
any encountered terrestrially. The gravitational pressure is supported
mainly by the pressure of the repulsive interaction of the nucleons. To
a first approximation a neutron star is like a giant nucleus made of
@xmath nucleons (mostly neutrons) with an average baryon density close
to the nuclear density. The star also has a solid crust roughly one
kilometer thick, compositionally similar to terrestrial crystalline
solids with highly neutron-rich nuclei. The core beneath the crust is
essentially a sea of neutrons with a mere ten percent sprinkling of
protons and an equal number of electrons to maintain charge neutrality.
Besides having an average density of about @xmath a neutron star also
has a huge neutron excess. When a neutron star forms in a supernova
explosion the temperature attained is higher than the characteristic
temperatures of all the equilibrating chemical reactions. Consequently,
all of the neutron star material is @xmath -equilibrated where most of
the protons have been converted to neutrons due to enhanced inverse
@xmath -decay in a dense environment. As the electron Fermi sea is
filled up the reverse process, i.e., the decay of a neutron to a proton,
an electron and an anti-neutrino, is progressively blocked resulting in
the neutron excess.

Except near the surface the neutron star behaves like an effective
zero-temperature system, the actual temperature ( @xmath K or less in
the crust and @xmath K in the core after about @xmath years) being much
smaller than the characteristic temperatures (the Fermi temperature of
the electrons or the neutrons or the energy of the nucleon-nucleon
interaction). Therefore almost whole of the star can be described as a
degenerate, free Fermi system (electrons being the dominant component
near the surface and neutrons in the interior). We shall not discuss
here the superfluid states of neutrons or protons believed to exist in
the core. Density-wise the neutron star has three characteristically
different regions. The thin outer crust with densities ranging from
@xmath at the surface to @xmath ( neutron drip density ) at which free
neutrons start dripping out of the nuclei. Next is the inner crust with
densities in-between the neutron-drip density and the nuclear density (
@xmath ). Beyond the nuclear density the nuclei dissolve to produce a
soup of nucleons.

#### 2.1.1 outer crust : @xmath

This is the best understood density regime of all. The pressure is
primarily due to that of the degenerate electrons, charge neutrality
being maintained by an ionic crystal. For @xmath the electrons become
relativistic. As density increases beyond this value the electron Fermi
energy approaches the MeV range where it becomes energetically
favourable for the protons to undergo inverse @xmath -decay and convert
themselves to neutrons giving rise to the neutron-rich nuclei in the
crust. The equilibrium nuclide for a given density is obtained by
minimizing the free energy of the system with respect to a particular
combination of ( @xmath ) keeping the baryon number density constant.
The first such calculation was done by \citeN baym71a, reproduced here
in table [2.1], based on Bethe-Weizs̈acker semi-empirical mass formula
with parameters obtained from fits to laboratory nuclei. Recently,
\citeN haen89b have redone these calculations using more refined
methods, though their results do not differ very much from the earlier
ones. Among the factors important in deciding the equilibrium nuclide at
a given density are the neutron and proton (dominant just below the
neutron drip) shell effects and the strength of the spin-orbit
interaction which depends on the three and higher body nucleon-nucleon
interactions (defining the energy of the individual nuclei).

The pressure of a free, Fermi degenerate electron gas in the zero
temperature phase is given by :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.1)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath ( @xmath ) is the relativistic parameter and @xmath (
@xmath ) is the electron Compton wavelength. But the mass density is
given by the rest-mass of the ions,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the mean molecular weight, @xmath is the atomic mass
unit and @xmath ( @xmath ) is the electron number density. To obtain the
correct equation of state, several corrections have to be incorporated
in the above expression for pressure. Firstly, the electrostatic
correction arises because the positively charged ions are not uniformly
distributed, but arranged in a crystal lattice with lattice sites having
a charge @xmath each. This decreases the energy and the pressure of the
ambient electrons as the distance between the repelling electrons is on
an average larger than the mean distance between nuclei and electrons.
Therefore, the repulsion is weaker than attraction. In a non-degenerate
gas, the ratio between this Coulomb correction to the thermal energy is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

and in a degenerate gas when Coulomb energy is comparable to the Fermi
energy we have,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Bohr radius. When this correction is taken into
consideration it is found that the pressure is modified as @xmath , with
@xmath for @xmath . Therefore, this is the minimum equilibrium density
obtained at the very surface of the neutron star. At higher densities
the most important correction is due to the inverse @xmath -decay . The
condition for the inverse @xmath -decay ( @xmath ) is that the kinetic
energy of the electrons be larger than 1.24 MeV, the mass difference
between a neutron and a proton. The @xmath -decay of a neutron ( @xmath
) is blocked when the density is so large that all the electron levels
in the Fermi sea are filled up to the energy of the emitted electron.

The pressure is obtained by the thermodynamic relation @xmath , where
@xmath is the total free-energy density including the rest-mass of the
baryons and @xmath is the baryon number density. When one species of
nuclide changes to another as @xmath changes there is a phase transition
with an accompanying discontinuity in @xmath . Since there can be no
discontinuity in the pressure and the temperature inside the star to
obtain the equilibrium composition and the equation of state Gibbs’ free
energy should be minimized. In this density range usually the equation
of state obtained by \citeN baym71a, incorporating the results of \citeN
feyn49 in the range @xmath , is used. In table [2.2] the equation of
state (pressure vs. mass density) as calculated by them is shown.

#### 2.1.2 inner crust : @xmath

At the lower edge of this regime, the neutron energy levels within the
nuclei merge into a continuum and they drip out of the nuclei to
comprise a free neutron gas co-existing with the crystal lattice of the
neutron-rich nuclei. The problem of calculating an accurate equation of
state here is that the correct nucleon-nucleon potential is not known to
any degree of certainty, and that the quantum many-body techniques are
not quite adequate to solve the Schrödinger equation given the
potential. In this regime, with the proton-to-neutron ratio ranging from
0.1 to 0.3, extrapolations based on semi-empirical mass formula is used.
The work done by \citeN baym71b took care of the fact that the neutrons
inside and outside the nuclei behave in a similar fashion. The nuclear
surface energy is modified by the free neutron gas outside. By using a
compressible liquid drop model of nuclei they minimized the total
energy, for a fixed value of the baryon density @xmath , for an
equilibrium configuration. Free neutrons supply an increasingly larger
fraction of the pressure as the density increases.

But these earlier works did not take the nuclear shell effects into
account, as was later done by \citeN nege73. The main feature of this
work has been the modeling of the nucleon-nucleon interaction by taking
into consideration the two-body interactions only. The dominant two-body
interaction, by exchange of pions, come from processes like the ones in
figure [ 2.1 ]. The equation of state in the above mentioned density
range is given by the following interpolation formula :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.5)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.6)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the mass of the neutron and @xmath , @xmath being the
baryon number density. The constants @xmath s are given in table [2.3].

Another important fact is that at these densities the solid state and
the nuclear energies are comparable. Hence they require to be treated on
equal footing. This leads to the possibility of existence of
non-spherical nuclei. It has been shown by \citeN lorn93 that at
sub-nuclear densities nuclei with rod or disc shape are likely to exist.
If they indeed do, that will introduce a modification in the equation of
state in these density ranges and may in turn affect the structure and
other physical properties (like the transport coefficients or the
thermal evolution) of a neutron star.

#### 2.1.3 the core : @xmath

The theories at these densities are faced with a plethora of problems.
There is a lack of understanding of the correct form for the
nucleon-nucleon potential added to the fact that there is no laboratory
data available to test the theory against. As the density increases the
effects of relativity becomes important. Also at higher densities it is
essential to incorporate the non-nucleonic degrees of freedom as mesons
and higher mass baryons make appearance. At extreme high densities there
may probably occur a phase transition to the quark phase and then quark
and gluonic degrees of freedom should also have to be taken into
account. And even at nuclear saturation densities the predictions
regarding the possible phase transition to a superfluid/superconducting
phase are not without uncertainties. One of the major problems in trying
to understand the nuclear phenomena inside a neutron star is due to the
huge neutron excess. The parameter @xmath , used to denote the neutron
excess is about 1/4 in terrestrial nuclei. In neutron stars, starting
from that value at the surface @xmath becomes as large as unity deep in
the interior of the star. Any extrapolation, that requires going up by a
factor of four, is bound to be unreliable.

Nevertheless, we have reasonable estimates for the nucleon-nucleon
interaction based on the scattering data from the laboratory
experiments. But these provide information only about the long-range
behaviour of the potential. There is no handle on the short-range
behaviour, which is likely to dominate at the neutron star densities.
From the data on the binding energy of light nuclei the microscopic
Hamiltonian is modelled. But aspects of interaction that are relatively
unimportant for such light nuclei (deuterium, He @xmath etc.) may play
significant roles in a neutron star. Of particular importance are the
three and higher body interactions. At long range, the most important
three-body interaction is that due to the exchange of pions, where one
of the nucleons becomes converted to a @xmath and then de-excites back
by exchanging another pion with a third nucleon (figure [ 2.2 a]). At
short-range other processes like those in figures [ 2.2 b] and [ 2.2 c]
dominate.

To summarize, we mention the three equations of state which incorporate
some of the recent developments, following \citeN wiri88 (though more
recent calculations for the equation of state in this density range has
been performed, see for example \citeN prak92. In this paper, they
compare the equations of state obtained by using different types of
two-body and three-body potentials as against the equation of state for
a pure, free neutron gas. The two-body potentials used by them are AV14
(Argonne 14) and UV14 (Urbana 14) both of which fit the scattering data
well but differ in their short-range behaviour. These are modified with
the three-body interaction UVII which is adjusted to fit the binding
energies of He @xmath and He @xmath . The other three-body interaction
TNI is less complete in taking into account all aspects of the
three-body interaction. It is observed that, at @xmath , where @xmath is
the saturation nuclear density, the total energy per particle differs by
an amount small compared to the mass of the neutrons from that obtained
by using a free-neutron gas. It is also seen that the energy per
particle depends on the choice of the two-body as well as the three-body
interaction. Lastly, though the energy does not change much, the
pressure, given by the slope of the energy curve ( @xmath ), is very
different for different equations of state. In table [2.4], is the data
from \citeN wiri88 for the three equations of state.

A combination of the Baym, Pethick & Sutherland (BPS), Negele &
Vautherin (NV) and Wiringa, Fiks & Fabrocini (WFF) equations of state in
the respective density ranges seem to be the most acceptable considering
all the uncertainties mentioned above. In our subsequent calculation of
the structure of a neutron star we shall use this combination as our
starting point. Amongst the three equations of state given by Wiringa et
al. we have used only the second one mentioned as UV14+UVII in the
discussion above.

### 2.2 mass and density profile of a neutron star

In this thesis we investigate the temporal behaviour of the magnetic
fields assuming a crustal current. This requires an accurate knowledge
of the various transport coefficients (most importantly thermal and
electrical conductivity) in the crust. Therefore, we need an accurate
density profile, particularly in the low density crustal regions, to
obtain the radial behaviour of the transport coefficients. The mass and
density profiles for a non-rotating, self-gravitating object are
obtained by integrating the hydrostatic pressure balance equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

along with the equation of mass distribution,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath are the pressure, mass and density at a given radius @xmath
and @xmath is the gravitational constant. Equation[ 2.8 ] is modified,
when effects of general relativity is incorporated, to :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the speed of light. This is known as the TOV equation
after Tolman, Oppenheimer and Volkoff [ Oppenheimer & VolkoffOppenheimer
& Volkoff1939 ] . A measure of the importance of general relativity is
given by the quantity @xmath for a self-gravitating body of rest mass
@xmath and total radius @xmath . For @xmath , the effect of relativity
can be neglected. Putting in the typical numbers for a neutron star we
obtain @xmath to be close to 1. Therefore, to obtain the mass-density
profile of a neutron star it is required to solve the TOV equation
instead of the Newtonian hydrostatic equation. We solve equations [ 2.9
] and [ 2.10 ] numerically. The equation of state we use for this
structure calculation is of moderate stiffness and is given by \citeN
baym71a in the density range @xmath , by \citeN nege73 in the range
@xmath , and by \citeN wiri88 in the range @xmath . In figures [ 2.3 ],
[ 2.4 ], [ 2.5 ] - the pressure vs. density as obtained in these three
ranges have been plotted.

Though the structure calculations have been performed by many people
(see for example \citeNP wiri88) an accurate density profile in the low
density regime of the crust, has been lacking. Therefore, we undertook
the task of obtaining the density profile for a typical neutron star, by
integrating the TOV equation, using above-mentioned equations of state.
It must be mentioned here that in a recent work \citeN datt95 have
performed detailed calculations of the crustal density profile of
neutron stars for a number of equations of state. One ought to note that
the equations of state for different density regimes are not exactly
matched at the boundaries. So we use a smoothing procedure ensuring the
continuity of the pressure and the pressure gradient at each boundary.
This smoothed composite equation of state is plotted in figure [ 2.6 ].

We integrate the TOV equation starting from a particular central density
and corresponding central pressure at zero radius. The other boundary
condition at the centre is that of zero mass. The set of coupled second
order ordinary differential equations are solved using a fourth order
Runge-Kutta scheme of differencing. We have used the ordinary
differential equation solver programs by \citeN pres92. for the
Runge-Kutta driver with an adaptive step-size control. The adaptive
step-size control is essential in integrating the mass-density profile
since both the functions show extremely steep behaviour near the
surface, at the low density regime. In our computation the surface
corresponds to a density of 7.86 @xmath as that is the minimum density
obtained in the neutron star. The density and the mass profiles for a
neutron star of total mass 1.4 are plotted in figures [ 2.7 ] and [ 2.8
] respectively.

For different central densities, the total mass and the radius of the
star differ quite a lot. The variation of the total mass and the radius
with central density have been plotted in figures [ 2.9 ] and [ 2.10 ].
And the mass-radius relation for a set of neutron stars state is plotted
in figure [ 2.11 ]. This clearly shows the existence of a maximum mass,
which could also be seen (albeit with some difficulty) in figure [ 2.9
]. This maximum mass of about 2.2 corresponds to a central density of
@xmath and a radius of 10 km.

We plot the variation of the mass of the overlying layers and density
with the depth from the surface in figures [ 2.12 ] and [ 2.13 ]. It
should be noted that the density changes sharply with depth whereas the
mass remains almost constant close to the surface and then shows a sharp
increase. This is due to the fact that the mass in the outer layers of
the neutron star is very small. In figure [ 2.14 ] we have plotted the
mass of the core and the mass of the crust as functions of the total
mass. It is seen that with an increase in the total mass the mass of the
core increases almost by the same amount. Whereas, the change in the
mass of the crust is minimal. Figures [ 2.15 ] and [ 2.16 ] in which we
plot the change in crustal and core mass vs. a change in the total mass
brings this fact out more dramatically.

### 2.3 thermal evolution of neutron stars

#### 2.3.1 isolated neutron star

Thermal evolution of a system is determined by the processes of energy
loss and those of heat generation. In the case of a neutron star heat
loss is mainly by emission of neutrinos from the interior and by
emission of photons from the surface of the star. There are various
mechanisms for internal heat generation, for example, friction due to
differential rotation of crustal neutron superfluid, dissipative
processes due to the core proton superconductor, heat release by
chemical change in the crust induced by spin-down of the star, ohmic
dissipation of current loops (supporting the magnetic field) due to the
finite conductivity in the crust or crust cracking etc (for details of
neutron star thermal evolution see \citeNP latt91,peth92,page98 and
references therein).

The dominant mechanism of cooling in the early phases of thermal
evolution is that of neutrino emission. Different regions of the star
produce neutrinos by different mechanisms, namely, by URCA process in
the core and neutrino pair bremsstrahlung in the crust. The
comparability of the two processes depends on the presence of exotic
phases in the core and whether direct URCA process can proceed in the
core after it has cooled down below @xmath K. It also depends on the
band-structure of the electrons in the crust of the star, which may
suppress the neutrino pair bremsstrahlung considerably. In the core, if
the matter is a normal n-p-e plasma and the proton fraction is not too
high then neutrinos are emitted via modified URCA process. Through this
process the star cools with a time-scale of @xmath . In presence of
exotic phases like quark matter or Bose condensates of kaons or pions
direct URCA process can proceed. With a @xmath dependence on temperature
this process results in rapid cooling. Since the state of the matter in
the core of a neutron star is not known with any certainty, there is a
lot of controversy about whether direct or modified URCA processes
control neutron star thermal evolution. Moreover, there is uncertainty
in the rate calculation for the modified URCA process due to medium
effects etc and therefore a comparison with observation does not yet
provide a definite answer.

All of the above discussion assumes the matter to be normal and the
spectrum of elementary excitations smooth near the Fermi surfaces of the
particles. In presence of superfluidity or superconductivity gaps would
open up near the Fermi surfaces suppressing neutrino emission at
temperatures less than the gap energy. Under these conditions the
neutrino pair bremsstrahlung is the dominant cooling process. Recent
work by \citeN peth94 has shown that this crust cooling process may get
suppressed due to the creation of the band structure as electrons move
in the periodic lattice potential, below a temperature of @xmath K.
Recently, the effect of Cooper pair breaking and formation has also been
incorporated in the thermal evolution calculations [ Schaab et al.Schaab
et al.1997 ] .

In a recent work \citeN iwam95 have shown that a finite magnetic moment
of neutrino would significantly modify the cooling history of a neutron
star in the very early phases. This makes the crustal cooling compete
with the core cooling within the typical time scale that conduction
takes to transport thermal energy from the core to the surface.

It appears that the present data is compatible with both the slow and
fast cooling processes (modified and direct URCA) as there is a lot of
uncertainty in all the mechanisms involved in the thermal evolution of a
neutron star. In figure [ 2.17 ] taken from \citeN page98 different
theoretical scenarios could be seen and how these theories compare with
the observational values of surface temperatures measured for various
pulsars. There are other factors that may be responsible for a
discrepancy between the theory of the thermal evolution of the neutron
stars and the observed values for the surface temperatures. For example
the temperature is usually estimated assuming the neutron star to behave
like a perfect black-body, but the pressure of an atmosphere and the
effects of a strong magnetic field may significantly modify this result
[ Pavlov et al.Pavlov et al.1996 , Shibanov & YakovlevShibanov &
Yakovlev1996 ] .

#### 2.3.2 thermal structure of an isolated neutron star

Temperature fluctuations in the interior of the neutron star are
smoothed out very fast due to its large thermal conductivity and
effectively the whole of the star behaves like an isothermal system,
except at the layers close to the surface [ Gudmundsson, Pethick, &
EpsteinGudmundsson et al.1982 ] . Though the temperature of the entire
region beyond a density of @xmath is practically the same, it drops by
almost two orders of magnitude at the outermost layers of the star. The
work of \citeN gudm82,gudm83 on the envelopes of non-magnetic neutron
stars showed that the temperature of the isothermal interior, @xmath ,
depends only on the surface temperature and the surface gravity of the
star :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the surface temperature and @xmath is the surface
gravity. These authors also present the variation of the temperature
with density between the surface and the isothermal interior. To obtain
temperature as a function of density in these outer regions of the crust
we use the following fitting formula to their plots :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the density beyond which the temperature stays
effectively constant.

#### 2.3.3 accreting neutron star

The thermal history of an accreting neutron star is very different from
that of an isolated one. The cooling of an isolated neutron star brings
the surface temperature down to @xmath K in about @xmath yr with an
attendant interior temperature of the nearly isothermal core of the
order of @xmath K [ van Ripervan Riper1991a ] . Therefore when mass
accretion starts this cold star is heated up due to the entropy inflow
of the accreted matter. The temperature rise might be enough to start
nuclear burning at the surface and one expects pycnonuclear shell
burning of hydrogen and helium. Within a short time ( @xmath yr) almost
the entire crust is heated to a constant temperature of the order of
@xmath K [ Miralda-Escude, Paczynski, & HaenselMiralda-Escude et al.1990
] . This is ignoring an initial short phase in which both the rate of
accretion and the temperature of the crust show time evolution. The rate
of accretion stabilizes in a few thousand years [ SavonijeSavonije1978 ]
. The temperature that the crust will finally attain in the steady phase
has been computed by Fujimoto et \citeN fuji84, \citeN mira90 and \citeN
zdun92. However, these computations are restricted to limited range of
mass accretion and also do not yield the same crustal temperature under
similar conditions. The results obtained by \citeN zdun92 for the
crustal temperatures for a given accretion rate in the range @xmath M
@xmath /yr @xmath M @xmath /yr could be fitted to the following formula:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

But extrapolation of this fit to higher rates of accretion gives
extremely high temperatures which would not be sustainable for any
reasonable period due to rapid cooling by neutrinos at those
temperatures. For the purpose of our calculations, we use equation [
2.12 ] as long as the temperature of the crust is smaller than @xmath K.
Beyond that we freeze the temperature at that upper limit. In figure [
2.18 ] we have plotted the variation of the crustal temperature with
accretion rate according to equation [ 2.12 ]. The thermal state of the
core depends strongly on the neutrino emissivity whereas the crust
remains largely indifferent to that. The core stays relatively cool if
there is pion condensate inside which induces enhanced neutrino cooling,
otherwise the core temperature may also be raised to a large extent by
mass accretion.

The above discussion does not take into account the fact that the
composition of the accreted layers could be very different from that of
the original cold catalysed composition. In a recent work it has been
shown that the presence of light elements in the accreted envelope
enhances the emission processes in the photon cooling era and hence
ultimately a faster cooling rate is achieved [ Chabrier, Potekhin, &
YakovlevChabrier et al.1997 , Potekhin, Chabrier, & YakovlevPotekhin
et al.1997 ] . Such effects show drastic difference in the surface
temperature (see \citeNP page98 for a discussion) already within ten
thousand years. If incorporated, this might change the evolution of the
magnetic field considerably.

### 2.4 transport properties in the crust of neutron stars

The investigations of the transport properties of ultra-dense matter
arise out of the interest in the evolution of the thermal state and the
magnetic field in white dwarfs and neutron star crusts. See \citeN
itoh94 and references therein for a good review on the transport
properties of neutron star crust. It has already been mentioned in
section [ 2.1 ] that the crust of a neutron star consists of a
relativistic, Fermi-degenerate free electron gas plus a
non-relativistic, non-degenerate liquid/crystal of ions. It is assumed
that the material is completely pressure-ionized. The density at which
this happens is given by the condition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

which turns out to be @xmath for Fe @xmath ions. Therefore, the lower
boundary for which the transport properties have been worked out is this
particular density. Though, recently, \citeN itoh93b have investigated
the entire density range below this value.

The thermal and electrical conduction is basically carried out by the
electrons. The electrical conductivity is given by following simple
Drude formula [ Ashcroft & MerminAshcroft & Mermin1979 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the number density of electrons and @xmath is the
effective mass of the electron in the crystal. @xmath is the time-scale
of the collision of electrons with the ions (in liquid phase) or
phonons/impurities (in case of a crystalline solid). It must be
mentioned here that although the importance of quantum corrections have
been realized in the present context, not much progress has been made in
that direction

In the crust of a neutron star both density and temperature vary with
radius. Whereas the uppermost layers close to the surface are likely to
be in a liquid state, the inner crust is a crystalline solid. The
condition for melting/crystallization of a classical one-component
plasma is given by Lindeman criterion. According to this criterion [
Slattery, Doolen, & DewittSlattery et al.1982 ] ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

equals 172 at the melting point. For a crystal composed of ionic species
of charge @xmath and lattice spacing @xmath , the Coulomb Energy per ion
is @xmath and the thermal energy of an ion is approximately @xmath where
@xmath is the temperature of the crystal. Therefore,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

The inter atomic spacing @xmath , in terms of density is,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath and @xmath being the proton mass and the mass number of the ion,
respectively. Then the melting temperature is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the density in @xmath . In figure [ 2.19 ] the melting
temperature has been plotted versus density in the crust of a 1.4
neutron star.

Densities for which the actual temperature is above the melting
temperature, the material is in a liquid state. The transport properties
in such a state is determined by the electron-ion collisions and by
electron-phonon collisions in the solid phase. The three factors
important factors in calculating electron-phonon collision time-scale
are - the dielectric screening of the phonon spectrum by the
relativistic, Fermi-degenerate electrons, the Debye-Waller factor for
the pure Coulomb, bcc crystal and the atomic form factor. The
Debye-Waller factor changes the conductivity by a factor of two to four
at the melting temperature. And when the electron de-Broglie wavelength
becomes comparable to the nuclear size the third correction becomes
rather important. Unlike the terrestrial situation, in the crust of a
neutron star the Umklapp process dominates. For lower temperatures, the
dominant process is that of the collision of electrons with the impurity
atoms. These collisions are similar to the electron-ion collision in the
liquid phase, except that here the effective charge is the difference
between the charge of the impurity atom and the charge of the dominant
species. The temperature or density of the cross-over from phonon
dominated to impurity dominated process depends on the impurity strength
@xmath , given by,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the total ion density, @xmath is the density of impurity
species @xmath with charge @xmath , and @xmath is the ionic charge in
the pure lattice [ Yakovlev & UrpinYakovlev & Urpin1980 ] .

For our work, we have taken the expression for electrical conductivity
of the liquid and due to impurity concentration in the solid from \citeN
yako80. For the pure crystalline phase we have used the results of
\citeN itoh84. The conductivity in the liquid is given by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is defined by the relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

and @xmath is the Coulomb logarithm. In the solid, the conductivity has
contributions from both the phonon and the impurity processes.
Therefore, the conductivity is given by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.22)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.23)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

with,

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

In the following diagrams we have plotted the electrical conductivity in
the crust of a neutron star, as a function of density and emphasizing
the dependence on various parameters. In figure [ 2.20 ], the plot is
for different values of the impurity concentration @xmath for a given
surface temperature. Notice that in this case we assume a temperature
variation with density as is expected in a cool, isolated neutron star
(section 2.3 ). In figure [ 2.21 ], on the other hand, we have plotted
the conductivity for different values of the temperature which is
constant over the whole of the crust. In figure [ 2.22 ], we have shown
the change in conductivity with different values of @xmath , assuming
the same constant crustal temperature in each case.

In figures [ 2.21 ] and [ 2.22 ] we have plotted the conductivity
assuming the temperature to be constant over the entire crust. That is
the case for a star with an accretion heated crust after the temperature
has stabilized. For an isolated star with a very low surface temperature
and a non-zero temperature gradient in the outermost layers (as
described in section[ 2.3 ] above) the variation of conductivity with
density looks somewhat different. In figure [ 2.20 ] we plot the
conductivity profile for such a cool star. Note that the impurity
strength @xmath becomes important in this case.

It should be mentioned here that the above discussion does not refer to
the fact that the transport properties in the crust of a neutron star
must also take into account the presence of magnetic fields. As early as
in 1980, Urpin & Yakovlev had looked into this problem. And recently,
very refined results have been available in which conductivity
calculations have been made with magnetic field [ Potekhin, Chabrier, &
YakovlevPotekhin et al.1997 ] . Also, all the above calculations have
been made assuming a bcc lattice. Recently, \citeN baik95 have also
investigated the case of fcc lattice. But for our calculations we have
not made use of these refined results.

## Chapter 3 magnetic fields of neutron stars : a general introduction

### 3.1 overview

In the cosmic scheme of things the major players behind most of the
interesting phenomena are rotation and magnetic field. A unique
combination of very rapid rotation and a large magnetic field is what
makes a neutron star act as a pulsar. The rotation period of a pulsar
can be as small as 1.6 millisecond [ Backer et al.Backer et al.1982 ] ,
and even the smallest field observed in pulsars could be about three
orders of magnitude higher than the maximum field so far achieved in
terrestrial laboratories. The typical values of magnetic field in
pulsars range from @xmath Gauss to @xmath Gauss. It is the ultra-compact
nature of a neutron star that allows the extremes in both the spin rate
and the magnetic field strength. Because of the compactness it can
support a fast rotation against the centrifugal forces and at close to
nuclear densities even such high fields do not affect the state of the
matter significantly because the energy associated with the magnetic
field is insignificant compared to the other relevant energy scales [
Shapiro & TeukolskyShapiro & Teukolsky1983 ] .

It should also be noted that the neutron star material is something like
the ultimate high- @xmath super-conductor. Even though the temperature
in the interior of a newly born neutron star could be about @xmath K, it
is still small compared to the superconducting transition temperature,
believed to be a few times @xmath K. Hence, the material inside a
neutron star quickly settles into a superconducting state soon after its
birth in a supernova explosion [ AlparAlpar1991 , PinesPines1991 ] . We
shall see later that this plays an important role in shaping the
magnetic history of the star.

Unfortunately, there is as yet no satisfactory theory for either the
generation of the neutron star magnetic field or its subsequent
evolution [ BhattacharyaBhattacharya1995b ] . There is a major
uncertainty even about the possible location of the field in the
interior of the star. This question is in fact related to the problem of
the epoch and mechanism of field generation, as we shall see in the next
section [ SrinivasanSrinivasan1995 ] . It is obvious that, under these
circumstances, there can be no consensus regarding the theory of field
evolution as any such scenario will have to ultimately depend on the
nature of the underlying structure and location of the current loops
that support the observable field.

Nevertheless, a compilation of current observational facts provides us
with the nature of the questions that need to be looked into. They also
give an indication of the range of possible answers. These observational
facts strongly suggest that the field evolution is intricately related
to the binary history of a neutron star. In the rest of this chapter we
shall discuss the observational status and the current theoretical
attempts to understand the generation and the subsequent evolution of
the magnetic field in neutron stars. This provides the background for
the problems addressed by us in chapters [4], [5], [6] and [7].

### 3.2 origin

There are two main possibilities regarding the generation of the
magnetic field in neutron stars (for a review see \citeNP bhat95,
\citeNP srini95 and references therein). The field can either be a
fossil remnant from the progenitor star, or be generated after the
formation of the neutron star. Uncertainties surround both the scenarios
and observations are yet to be able to distinguish between the two. This
has led to a large variety of field evolution models that we shall
discuss in section [ 3.3 ].

#### 3.2.1 fossil field

Originally suggested by \citeN ginz64 and \citeN wolt64 long before the
discovery of pulsars, the idea of the fossil field is considered to be
the most promising. The magnetic field existing in the core of the
progenitor star gets enhanced when the core collapses in a supernova,
conserving the magnetic flux. Flux conservation demands an increase in
the field strength by a factor @xmath which is of the order of @xmath .
This can, depending on fields in the cores of the progenitor stars,
produce fields as large as @xmath Gauss. The field observed on neutron
stars is mainly the dipole component of the surface field. It is
possible that the subsurface/interior field is much higher than this
value.

In the core of a neutron star, the proton fraction is small (a maximum
of 10% when presence of exotic states like Kaon condensates is
considered [ Pethick & RavenhallPethick & Ravenhall1992 ] .
Nevertheless, the protons are believed to exist in a superconducting
state. Calculations indicate that this is a type II superconductor with
a lower critical field in excess of @xmath Gauss. Evidently, the
observed field values fall far short of this critical field and one
expects a complete flux expulsion in accordance with Meissner effect.
But unlike in a laboratory situation the flux expulsion encounters a
problem because the electrons coexisting with the protons do not form a
condensate state. The time scale in which the flux can be expelled is
therefore dictated by ohmic diffusion through the electron component.
Even at extremely high temperatures at the time of the birth of the
neutron star this ohmic diffusion time turns out to be larger than
@xmath years. Hence, superconducting transition occurs with the field
embedded in [ Ginzburg & KirzhnitsGinzburg & Kirzhnits1964 ] . The
magnetic field is carried in quantized flux tubes called Abrikosov
fluxoids, each fluxoid carrying a quantum of magnetic flux, @xmath G-cm
@xmath . Therefore, some @xmath such fluxoids would be present in a
neutron star with a typical field of @xmath Gauss.

One major problem with the concept of a fossil field is that strong
surface fields are not observed in massive stars except in some
dynamically peculiar ones. \citeN rudr73 suggest that the so-called
fossil magnetic field may not be a relic of the main sequence phase of
the star but can be generated in the core during the turbulent
Carbon-burning phase. The strong field can therefore be hidden in the
core, but given the short duration of evolution during and after the
Carbon-burning phase, it is unclear whether this field can organize
itself into large-scale poloidal components. A new input into the
physics of the fossil field has come from the refined many-body
calculations performed recently on the behaviour of the core
superconductor. These new results hint that the core superconductor is
likely to be of type I [ Ainsworth, Wambach, & PinesAinsworth et al.1989
] . This would mean a completely different structure for the field and
would require a redressal of some of the existing theories of field
evolution involving flux expulsion associated with the spin-down of
pulsars (discussed in subsection [ 3.3.1 ]).

#### 3.2.2 post-formation field generation

Almost all of the existing field evolution models ultimately depend on
ohmic dissipation of the currents in the crust of a neutron star, where
the electrical conductivity, though very large by any terrestrial
standard, is still finite (in contrast to the superconducting interior
which can be thought to have an infinite conductivity). Therefore, any
model that makes generation of currents in the crust possible is a very
attractive proposition. We have mentioned earlier that the interior of a
neutron star quickly settles into a superconducting state immediately
after birth, as soon as its temperature falls below a few times @xmath
K. This transition happens within a day or so after the formation of the
star, and the observed field values are much smaller than the critical
field of this superconductor. Hence, any field that is generated after
the formation of the star has to be embedded in the region in which the
protons are in a normal state. So post-formation generation mechanisms
give rise to fields that are completely crustal and in particular
confined to densities below neutron drip [ Blandford, Applegate, &
HernquistBlandford et al.1983 , RomaniRomani1990 , Urpin & MuslimovUrpin
& Muslimov1992a ] .

Following an idea originally proposed by \citeN yako80, \citeN blnd83
worked out a possible mechanism for field generation. They suggested
that magnetic field arises as a consequence of thermal effects occurring
in the outer crust in the early phases of the thermal evolution of the
star immediately after it is formed. The investigation is confined to
the degenerate surface layers of non-rotating neutron stars, assuming
that the plasma is in hydrostatic equilibrium. The density range
considered is @xmath , where the mechanism for field enhancement
functions most effectively.

The field can grow either in the liquid phase and then be convected into
the solid regions, or it could grow in the solid crust itself. In the
solid, the heat flux is carried by the degenerate electrons giving rise
to thermoelectric instabilities that in turn make the horizontal
components of the magnetic field grow exponentially with time. The field
grows with a time-scale of @xmath years. Such instability can also
develop if the liquid phase that lies above the solid contains a
horizontal magnetic field. The coexistence of a heat flux and a seed
magnetic field, in excess of @xmath Gauss, in the liquid will cause the
fluid to circulate which may lead to effective dynamo action. If that is
the case then the field will grow rapidly, with a time scale of about a
@xmath years, and supply the flux to the solid. Either of these two
instabilities will soon saturate to produce a field strength of @xmath
Gauss, where the instabilities become non-linear. Further growth will be
prevented when either the magnetic stress exceeds the lattice yield
stress or the temperature perturbations become non-linear, both of which
happen at a subsurface field of @xmath Gauss. The corresponding surface
field is @xmath Gauss.

The above mentioned mechanism is most effective for large temperature
gradients. And the instabilities grow only if the ohmic diffusion
time-scales are such that the increase in the field is not dissipated
away at a faster rate than the growth. Unfortunately, for that to happen
in the solid the conductivity should be at least a factor of three
higher than the present estimates. Or if the surface layer is made of
helium the instabilities can grow to large values. It must be noted here
that the mechanism of field-growth mentioned here generates small loops
only. The growth time-scales in the solid is too long which makes the
field generation in the liquid layers the only viable option. The most
effective way is to generate the flux in the liquid and then quickly
anchor it in the solid crust either by advection of the flux or by
freezing the liquid layer itself due to cooling of the star.

This work was extended for the case of rotating neutron stars by \citeN
urpn86. They studied the thermo-magnetic instability in less deep and
hence less dense liquid layers. In non-rotating neutron stars, the
smearing of the instability due to hydrodynamic motions is an impediment
to fast growth of field in the liquid. Fast rotations ( @xmath s),
however suppresses these hydrodynamic motions by Coriolis force. This
mechanism is most effective when the electron temperature is @xmath K
and leads to the growth of an azimuthally symmetric toroidal magnetic
field. Typical time-scale of field growth is of the order of a year and
the typical horizontal wavelength is about 100 metres. The field is
created at a depth of about 50 metres at density of the order of @xmath
.

The post-formation field generation mechanism is besieged by a number of
problems, which were recognized by the early workers themselves. First
and foremost is the fact that this mechanism is capable of generating
only toroidal modes. And the scale-size of the field is confined to the
melting depth of the crust which is of the order of hundred meters. In a
series of papers, Geppert & Wiebicke \citeyear gepp91,gepp95 and
Wiebicke & Geppert \citeyear wieb91,wieb92,wieb95,wieb96 have
investigated the problem of field generation in the crust of neutron
stars in detail. Their work reiterates the fact that the temperature
gradient driven thermo-magnetic instability can only give rise to
toroidal field, albeit strong. They have shown that it is possible to
generate toroidal modes of very high polarities ( @xmath ) in a short
time ( @xmath years) and that the magnitude of such field could also be
quite large. But how such field could get restructured to a generate
large-scale polar fields, the only kind that is actually observed in
neutron stars, is still a point of much speculation.

As yet, there is no observational evidence for distinguishing one kind
of field generation mechanism from the other. The only hope lies in the
nature of the evolution of the field itself. Since the generation
mechanism decides the question of underlying current structure, one
expects that the predicted field evolution would be different for these
two cases, and observations would be able to probe this difference. In
chapter [8] we shall make some comments about the conclusions we have
drawn regarding this problem from the nature of the field evolution and
the evolutionary link between the population of normal pulsars and their
millisecond counterparts.

### 3.3 evolution

The evolution of neutron star magnetic field has been of abiding
interest both because it is a challenging problem in itself and also due
to the fact that many other aspects of pulsar physics crucially depend
on the nature of field evolution. Even though over the years a somewhat
coherent picture has emerged, some of the key issues still remain
unresolved. In particular, the generation of millisecond pulsars and
their evolutionary link to the population of normal pulsars through a
processing in binaries has become one of the major challenges that faces
the researchers at present. There have been several excellent reviews
detailing the current worries and the status of the theoretical
endeavors [ BhattacharyaBhattacharya1995b ,
BhattacharyaBhattacharya1995a , Bhattacharya & SrinivasanBhattacharya &
Srinivasan1995 , RudermanRuderman1995 ] . In this chapter, we shall
recapitulate, in brief, the present situation, the observational
indications and the theoretical models.

From observational facts and from the recent statistical analyses made
on the pulsar population, the following conclusions can be drawn
regarding the field evolution.

-   Isolated pulsars with high magnetic fields ( @xmath – @xmath G) do
    not undergo any significant field decay during their lifetimes [
    Bhattacharya et al.Bhattacharya et al.1992 , Wakatsuki
    et al.Wakatsuki et al.1992 , LorimerLorimer1994 , Hartman
    et al.Hartman et al.1997 ] .

-   The fact that binary pulsars as well as millisecond and globular
    cluster pulsars which almost always have a history of being a member
    of a binary, possess much lower field strengths, suggests that
    significant field decay occurs only as a result of the interaction
    of a neutron star with its binary companion [ BailesBailes1996 ] .

-   The age determination of pulsars with white dwarf companions show
    that most of the millisecond pulsars are extremely long-lived. The
    old age ( @xmath years) of the low-field pulsars implies that their
    field is stable over long time-scales. That is after the recycling
    process in the binaries is over, the field does not undergo any
    further decay [ Bhattacharya & SrinivasanBhattacharya &
    Srinivasan1986 , KulkarniKulkarni1986 , van den Heuvel, van
    Paradijs, & Taamvan den Heuvel et al.1986 , Verbunt, Wijers, &
    BurmVerbunt et al.1990 ] .

-   The evolutionary link between millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray
    binaries seem to be borne out both from binary evolution models and
    from the comparative study of the kinematics of these two
    populations. To spin a neutron star up to millisecond periods at
    least an amount @xmath needs to be accreted. Such huge amount of
    mass transfer is possible only in low mass X-ray binaries, where the
    duration of mass transfer could be as long as @xmath years. And even
    though the present estimates for the birthrate of low mass X-ray
    binaries fall short of that of the millisecond pulsars [ Kulkarni &
    NarayanKulkarni & Narayan1988 , LorimerLorimer1995 ] , kinematic
    studies [ Cordes et al.Cordes et al.1990 , WolszczanWolszczan1994 ,
    Nice & TaylorNice & Taylor1995 , Nicastro & JohnstonNicastro &
    Johnston1995 , BhattacharyaBhattacharya1996b , Ramachandran &
    BhattacharyaRamachandran & Bhattacharya1997 , Cordes &
    ChernoffCordes & Chernoff1997 ] , indicate that the two populations
    are most likely to be related as both have very similar kinematic
    properties.

#### 3.3.1 models of field evolution

In order to understand the above facts, attempts have been made to
relate the field decay to the star’s binary history. There are two
classes of models which have been explored in this context one that
relates the magnetic field evolution to the spin evolution of the star
and the other attributing the field evolution to direct effects of mass
accretion (see \citeNP rudr95 and \citeNP db95a for detailed reviews).
It should also be mentioned here that almost all the models are built
upon two themes, namely, a large scale macroscopic restructuring of the
fields in the interior of the star (for example, the spin-down and
expulsion of flux from the superfluid core of the star) and a
microscopic mechanism (like ohmic dissipation of the currents in the
crust) acting to actually kill the underlying currents supporting the
observable field. The different class of models usually assume different
kind of initial field configuration. Models depending on spin-down
assume a core-flux supported by proton superconductor flux tubes.
Whereas, models invoking ohmic dissipation usually assume an initial
crustal configuration. It should be noted here that a whole host of
models exist that discuss field evolution of isolated neutron stars (for
a list of such models see \citeN db96b). But we shall confine our
discussion to accretion-induced models alone.

The former class of models involves the inter-pinning of the Abrikosov
fluxoids (of the superconducting protons) and the Onsager-Feynman
vortices (of the superfluid neutrons) in the core [ Srinivasan
et al.Srinivasan et al.1990 , RudermanRuderman1991a ] ). This class also
includes the models involving the plate tectonics of the neutron star
crust [ RudermanRuderman1991b , RudermanRuderman1991c ] . \citeN srini90
pointed out that neutron stars interacting with the companion’s wind
would experience a major spin-down, causing the superconducting core to
expel the magnetic flux, which would then undergo ohmic decay in the
crust. This coupled evolution of spin and magnetic field has been
modeled both for the cases of wide low mass X-ray binaries [ Jahan Miri
& BhattacharyaJahan Miri & Bhattacharya1994 ] and high mass X-ray
binaries [ Jahan MiriJahan Miri1996 ] . They have assumed ohmic decay of
the expelled field in the crust with a constant decay constant of @xmath
years. An investigation of the nature of the ohmic decay of such
expelled field in an accretion heated crust has also been attempted [
Bhattacharya & DattaBhattacharya & Datta1996 ] , and shows that the
final field values could be quite consistent with those observed for
millisecond pulsars. Ruderman \citeyear rudr91b,rudr91c on the other
hand, suggests a coupling between the spin and the magnetic evolution of
the star via crustal plate tectonics - torques acting on the star cause
crustal plates, and the magnetic poles anchored in them, to migrate,
resulting in major changes of the effective dipole moment.

The other class of models attribute the field decay to direct effects of
accretion. The work done in this thesis comes under this category of
models. Previous work by \citeN bisn74 and \citeN taam86 have suggested
that accreted matter might screen the pre-existing field. Computations
by \citeN roma90 indicate that hydrodynamic flows may bury the
pre-existing field reducing the strength at the surface. We shall see in
chapter[4] that strong Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities prevent such
hydrodynamic flows to create horizontal components of the field at the
expense of the dipolar component, and therefore such a screening
mechanism does not provide for a viable scenario of field evolution in
an accreting neutron star. The mechanism of ohmic decay, being unique to
the crustal currents, is also used in models where spin-down is invoked
for flux expulsion, for a subsequent dissipation of such flux in the
crust [ Jahan Miri & BhattacharyaJahan Miri & Bhattacharya1994 ,
Bhattacharya & DattaBhattacharya & Datta1996 ] .

The most important microscopic mechanism invoked for accretion-induced
field decay is that of fast ohmic decay. In an accretion-heated crust
the decay takes place principally as a result of rapid dissipation of
currents due to the decrease in the electrical conductivity and hence a
reduction in the ohmic dissipation time-scale [ Geppert & UrpinGeppert &
Urpin1994 , Urpin & GeppertUrpin & Geppert1995 , Urpin & GeppertUrpin &
Geppert1996 , Konar & BhattacharyaKonar & Bhattacharya1997 ] . The
crustal field undergoes ohmic diffusion due to the finite electrical
conductivity of the crustal lattice, but the time-scale of such decay is
very long under ordinary conditions [ Sang & ChanmugamSang &
Chanmugam1987 , Urpin & MuslimovUrpin & Muslimov1992b ] . The situation
changes significantly when accretion is turned on. The heating of the
crust reduces the electrical conductivity by several orders of
magnitude, thereby reducing the ohmic decay time-scale.

There is also an additional effect that acts towards stabilizing the
field. As the mass increases, a neutron star becomes more and more
compact and the mass of the crust actually decreases by a small amount.
So the newly accreted material forms the crust and the original crustal
material gets continually assimilated into the superconducting core
below. The original current carrying layers are thus pushed into deeper
and more dense regions as accretion proceeds. The higher conductivity of
the denser regions would progressively slow down the decay, till the
current loops are completely inside the superconducting region where any
further decay is prevented [ Konar & BhattacharyaKonar &
Bhattacharya1997 ] .

#### 3.3.2 the millisecond pulsar question

A summary of the current status of the important question of generation
of millisecond pulsars has recently been presented by \citeN bhat96a in
the proceedings of the IAU colloquium 160. The debate that followed the
presentation (recorded in the same proceedings) gives a fair indication
as to how bad the situation is. Here we shall just record the facts
relevant to the field evolution, ignoring such questions that are
associated with binary evolution and other factors.

In the fifteen years following the discovery of the first millisecond
pulsar more than fifty pulsars have been discovered which belong to this
particular category. In an attempt to understand the origin of
millisecond pulsars, it was suggested that these are recycled pulsars,
pulsars that have evolved to the characteristic magnetic field and
spin-period by virtue of their binary history.

The major problem regarding the generation of millisecond pulsars in the
binaries is the question of progenitors. What kind of binaries would
give rise to millisecond pulsars? We have already mentioned that there
is a problem of birthrate mismatch if one assumes that all the
millisecond pulsars come from low mass X-ray binaries we normally
observe. There is no satisfactory explanation for the origin of isolated
millisecond pulsars either. Any model for field evolution has to be
consistent with the nature of binary evolution that produced these
objects. The field evolution scheme must also provide for a limiting
minimum field strength—the so-called ‘flooring’ seen at @xmath G should
arise out of the evolution itself. Except for a few of the models [
RomaniRomani1995 , Jahan Miri & BhattacharyaJahan Miri &
Bhattacharya1994 , Konar & BhattacharyaKonar & Bhattacharya1997 ] an
explanation for this has not been attempted so far. And the models of
field evolution must also match the spin-evolution of the neutron star
in the binaries. Since there is no consensus on either the internal
field structure or the evolution of the field, one important check on
such models would be to look for a consistency of the field evolution
models with that of the binary evolution scenario. In chapter[6] we
attempt to look for such a consistency in general and from the point of
view of millisecond pulsar generation in particular.

### 3.4 general introduction to accretion-induced field evolution

In the previous section we have seen that observational facts and
statistical analyses of the existing data clearly relate the evolution
of magnetic field of neutron stars with binary interaction. In the next
chapter we shall address three different aspects of such binary-induced
field evolution. We investigate the underlying physical mechanisms that
take place in the interior of the star, changing the currents that are
flowing to maintain the observable field. We would interest ourselves
with a neutron star that is in active interaction with its binary
companion. This companion could be a main sequence star affecting the
neutron star through its wind. Alternatively, it could be a giant or a
super giant, in which case heavy mass transfer may take place through
Roche-lobe overflow [ Bhattacharya & van den HeuvelBhattacharya & van
den Heuvel1991 , King et al.King et al.1995 ] . In either of these
cases, there are some basic changes that the neutron star undergoes.
These changes in various physical parameters are responsible for a
change in the magnetic field. So, here is a brief resume of how the
process of accretion affects a neutron star.

-   The process of accretion mainly changes three parameters of the
    star, the total mass, the total angular momentum and the total
    energy. The change in energy comes about when the potential energy
    of the accreting particles get converted into random kinetic energy
    of the system and is then manifested as an increase in temperature.

-   Models of field evolution have been proposed using the changes in
    each of these quantities, namely relating the change in the
    observable field @xmath to @xmath (change in mass), @xmath (change
    in angular momentum) and @xmath (change in temperature). In this
    connection it should be mentioned that earlier attempts to show a
    proportionality between @xmath and @xmath have recently been
    challenged [ WijersWijers1997 ] .

-   The change in angular momentum has been exploited in models which
    assume an initial field confined to the superconducting core of the
    star. In particular, a rapid slow-down ( @xmath ) experienced by the
    neutron star during the ‘propeller phase’ causes the core field to
    be expelled to the crust, where it could undergo subsequent ohmic
    dissipation.

-   Ultimately most of the accretion-related models depend on the ohmic
    dissipation of currents in the crust for a permanent decrease in the
    field. The rapidity of such dissipation depends on a decrease of the
    electrical conductivity, caused by an increase in the temperature (
    @xmath ).

-   Another important factor influencing the field evolution is the
    hydrodynamic mass motion in the star. Near the surface the material
    flow is lateral, moving from polar (magnetic) to equatorial region.
    But interchange instabilities appear to prevent the screening of the
    field due to such hydrodynamic motions (chapter [4] of this thesis).

-   Deep inside the star the material movement is a simple radial
    inflow, due to the compression of the star as a result of an
    increase in the total mass. The material movement is, evidently, a
    direct effect of the change in mass ( @xmath ), with the actual flow
    dynamics determined by the rate of such change, i.e., the rate of
    mass accretion, , on the star. This radially inward motion in the
    deeper layers helps to advect crustal currents to more dense layers,
    ultimately stabilizing the field in such cases.

From the above discussion, we see that processes of both macroscopic and
microscopic nature are active in the interior of an accreting neutron
star. The change in angular momentum induces a large scale flux movement
whereas a change in total mass gives rise to large scale material
movement. Both these cause macroscopic restructuring of the current
pattern. On the other hand, a change in temperature induces the
microscopic process of ohmic dissipation, by which the energy stored in
the large scale field is transferred to the random kinetic energy of the
particles. In the following sections, we shall see how these two
mechanisms complement each other in the problems addressed by us.

## Chapter 4 effect of diamagnetic screening

### 4.1 introduction

First proposed by \citeN bisn74, the idea of a possible screening of the
magnetic field of a neutron star by accreting material onto it, has been
a recurrent theme in the field-evolution scenario. This suggestion was
substantiated by the work of \citeN taam86 in which they indicated that
the accreted matter, which is completely ionized plasma and hence
diamagnetic in nature, might screen the pre-existing field reducing the
strength of the surface field. Later \citeN blnd79 proposed a possible
mechanism for such a screening. They suggested that the material
accreting onto the poles of a magnetized neutron star will be confined
by the strong magnetic stresses near the surface of the star. At low
accretion rates the material sinks below the stellar surface until the
hydrostatic pressure of the stellar material is as large as the magnetic
pressure. The plasma then flows sideways giving rise to horizontal
components of the magnetic field. The creation of this horizontal
component comes at the expense of the vertical field and may result in a
decrease in the observed field strength. This work, however, did not
provide any quantitative details of the mechanism.

Later it was shown by \citeN wosl82 and \citeN hame83 that the accretion
column is actually like a small mountain on the polar cap rather than
being subsurface. The accreting material is mostly ionized hydrogen and
hydrogen has a smaller mean molecular weight per electron, @xmath , than
the iron crust of the star. Since most of the pressure in the accreted
layer comes from the electrons, hydrogen tends to float over the
underlying iron layer - if no material displacement perpendicular to the
magnetic field is possible. A hydrogen mountain then forms at the
surface of the neutron star. The height of this mountain depends on the
density at which the transmutation of hydrogen (by electron capture on
protons) takes place. When the material pressure in this accretion
column becomes much larger than the magnetic pressure then the material
starts flowing sideways giving rise to horizontal field components
reducing the external dipolar field strength.

The first quantitative calculations of diamagnetic screening of neutron
star magnetic field were performed by \citeN roma90. It was shown in
this work that hydrodynamic flows in the surface layers may bury the
field to deeper layers effectively reducing the surface strength. In a
later article [ RomaniRomani1995 ] in continuation to the earlier work,
various time-scales, relevant for an effective screening of the surface
field, were estimated. It was also shown here how the depth and density
at which the field might get buried depend on the strength of the
initial surface field.

In the present work, we investigate the effectiveness of diamagnetic
screening as a possible mechanism for a permanent reduction in the
surface field strength of the neutron stars. In particular, we shall try
to answer the following questions :

1.  Are diffusive time-scales, in the layers where the field is expected
    to be buried, long enough to allow screening to be an effective
    mechanism for long-term field reduction ?

2.  Is it at all possible to bury the field or create horizontal
    components at the expense of the vertical one against
    Rayleigh-Taylor overturn instability ?

Recently, calculations of screening have been performed assuming the
accreting material to be ferromagnetic [ Zhang, Wu, & YangZhang
et al.1994 , ZhangZhang1998 ] . Such an assumption of extremely large
magnetic permeability makes it possible to reduce the surface field by
about four orders of magnitude. In our work though, we regard the
accreting material to be completely ionized plasma (mainly hydrogen) and
therefore to be diamagnetic in nature.

The layout of the chapter is in the following form. In section [ 4.2 ]
we have discussed the nature of the material flow in an accreting
neutron star. In section [ 4.3 ] we discuss the actual mechanism of the
diamagnetic screening and the various relevant time-scales. And finally
in section [ 4.4 ] we present our conclusions.

### 4.2 accretion and material flow

For a neutron star with a strong magnetic field, the flow of the
accreting material outside the star is completely determined by the
field. The material flows in along open field lines and hits the surface
within the polar cap region. The area of this polar cap region is
determined by the rate of accretion and the strength of the magnetic
field [ Shapiro & TeukolskyShapiro & Teukolsky1983 ] . In all our
subsequent discussions we shall assume a situation where the magnetic
axis and the rotation axis are aligned. Even though that is hardly ever
the case in reality, this assumption does not affect the general
conclusions much.

The polar cap area, region constrained by open field lines on the
surface of the star, is given by,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where, @xmath is the radius of the star and @xmath is the angle the last
open field line makes with magnetic axis. This limiting field line is
the one which goes through the Alfvén radius, @xmath , in the equatorial
plane. Therefore, using the equation for the dipole field lines one
finds @xmath , so that the polar cap area is given by,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the limit @xmath (which is a reasonable approximation for the range
of field strength and accretion rate we consider), the above expression
reduces to the following simple form :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Alfvén radius of an accreting system is determined by the condition
that at this radius the ram pressure of the in-falling material equals
the pressure of the magnetic field. The ram pressure at the Alfvén
radius is :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the density and @xmath is the velocity of the accreting
material at Alfvén radius. In an accretion disc material rotates with
Keplerian velocity at every radius. Therefore, the velocity of the
material at Alfvén radius is given by,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

The density of the accreting material at Alfvén radius is :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where, the dependence on the rate of mass accretion is quite obvious. As
the field is dipolar in nature, the field strength at the Alfvén radius
is,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where, @xmath stands for the strength of the field at the surface of the
neutron star. Equating the ram pressure and the magnetic pressure, one
obtains the following expressions for the Alfvén radius and the polar
cap area respectively,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.8)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.9)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The density profile within the accretion column is described by an
‘atmosphere’ solution [ Bildsten & CutlerBildsten & Cutler1995 ] . The
pressure in the column, due to the relativistic degenerate electrons and
the ions, is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the number density of electrons (ions) and @xmath is the
electron mass. @xmath is the relativity parameter defined as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.11)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where @xmath is the Fermi momentum of the electrons, @xmath correspond
to the atomic number and mass number of the dominant ion species and
@xmath is density in units of @xmath . The scale height of the accretion
column is given by @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath are the density and
pressure respectively at the base of the accretion column and @xmath is
the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the state. Using the
above equation of state the scale height, for a @xmath star, is
approximately found to be :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

As long as the pressure in the accretion column is much smaller than the
magnetic pressure there can not be any material movement across the
field lines so the accreted material remains confined to the polar cap.
This kind of polar cap accretion causes transverse pressure gradients
that are balanced by the curvature of the magnetic field. An order of
magnitude estimate by Hameury et al. \citeN hame83 shows that in order
to create a significant distortion of the field lines due to the
overpressure of the accretion column the condition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

should be satisfied. Here, @xmath and @xmath stand for pressure due to
the material in the accretion column and due to the magnetic field
respectively. @xmath is the radius of the polar cap and @xmath is the
density scale height of the accretion column. For a given value of the
crustal field and a given rate of accretion, the density at which the
material starts flowing sideways, obtained from the condition given by
equation [ 4.13 ], is :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the field strength in units of @xmath Gauss and @xmath
is the accretion rate in units of @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath . This
condition is, of course, only valid in absence of any interchange
instabilities about which we shall discuss later. In figure [ 4.1 ] we
plot the variation of the flow density with the field strength for
various values of the accretion rate.

### 4.3 physics of diamagnetic screening

We shall, as has been mentioned above, work under the assumption of a
flux-frozen situation. This basically amounts to assuming an effectively
infinite conductivity. Admittedly, even though large, the actual value
of conductivity is finite. But the large values of conductivity in crust
provide for extremely long diffusive time-scales. In this case, the
assumption of ‘flux-freezing’ is a valid one since the flow time-scales
are much smaller compared to this diffusive time-scale (to be discussed
in the next section).

Therefore a reduction in the surface field is obtained due to the
combined effect of i) flux freezing and ii) hydrodynamic flow of the
material. Due to flux-freezing the total flux contained within an amount
of material remains constant. And when this material flows and spreads
out covering a larger area, the field gets adjusted to keep the flux
conserved. Say, the total flux contained within the polar cap at time
@xmath is @xmath . Conservation of flux then implies that we have,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore the change in the field strength is related to the change in
the area of the original polar cap surface due to material flow during
accretion. Assuming that the flow of material is such that at each
instant the amount accreted equals the amount flowing out from under the
accretion column one obtains the following relation between the change
in the polar cap area and the rate of mass accretion given by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

where, @xmath is the change in the polar cap area in time @xmath .
@xmath is the density where the flow takes place and @xmath is the
effective height of the accretion column, which hereafter we take
roughly to be equal to the density scale height @xmath . Integrating
equation [ 4.16 ] above the time variation of the polar cap area is
obtained in the following form -

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

where, @xmath is the original area of the polar cap. Then equation [
4.15 ] implies the following time dependence of the surface field :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have defined the screening time-scale by the relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is the time in which the original field reduces to half of its
original value. It should be noted here that \citeN shib89 obtained an
expression for the decay of magnetic field due to accretion very similar
to equation [ 4.15 ] from purely phenomenological considerations. Here
we have arrived at the above relation from a more physical point of
view.

To find the effectiveness of the screening we need to compare this
time-scale to the diffusive time-scale over which the field may
re-emerge by ohmic diffusion through the overlaying layers. The
diffusive time-scale is defined by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

where, @xmath is the electrical conductivity which is a function of the
density and the crustal temperature. We shall show later that if one
ignores interchange instabilities, then the flow time scale is much
smaller than diffusion time scale, and therefore field would remain
frozen and be dragged. Reconnection will then occur on the equatorial
plane and that will bury the field. Before this field can diffuse out
more matter will come and spread on top of it, and drive the field
deeper. So the eventual re-emergence time scale is set not by the
initial depth at which it was buried but the final depth to which it is
driven by continuous accretion. This can be very deep and the field can
even reach the core and therefore never get out again. But for the
moment, we take the burial depth to be equal to the scale height of the
density. For the screening time-scale this, of course, is the actual
length-scale. For the diffusive case we find the time-scale at the depth
where the field gets buried to begin with. We have not considered the
case of deep burial mentioned above, since from the subsequent
discussion that will prove to be unnecessary.

The point to be noted here is that for the screening mechanism described
above the important factor is the anisotropic material flow through the
polar cap. The area of polar cap increases with increasing rate of
accretion. Hence, for low rates of accretion, the flow is maximally
anisotropic. For high values of accretion rate, the polar cap could
cover a large fraction of the stellar surface area. The effect of
anisotropic material flow would not be very severe in that case. Also as
mentioned earlier, the temperatures are higher for higher values , a
lower value of conductivity and therefore a smaller diffusive time.
Hence, situations with low values of has better chance of screening the
field.

In all of the above discussion, the implicit assumption has been that it
is possible to create a horizontal component of the magnetic field, at
the expense of the vertical component, as a result of material flow in a
‘flux-frozen’ condition. But this mechanism is not viable against the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability. This instability arises due to magnetic
buoyancy. As the accreting material slowly builds up in a column, the
field lines tend to spread out due to the diamagnetic property of the
material. At the base of the accretion column, the field lines are
firmly anchored to the solid crust. Therefore material flow at the base
of the accretion column stretches the field lines out horizontally. This
creates horizontal components of the field giving rise to a screening of
the external dipole. We have seen earlier that the pressure of the
accretion column is much larger than the pressure of the magnetic field
in this region. Under such a condition the field lines re-organize
themselves into flux tubes as that is the minimum energy configuration.
These flux tubes move upward due to magnetic buoyancy and thereby
destroy the horizontal component of the field (see \citeNP spru83 and
references therein).

In a tube in pressure equilibrium with its surroundings the pressure is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

However at the base of the accretion column @xmath and the above
relation simplifies to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore, the gas pressure within a flux tube is smaller than the gas
pressure outside. Then from equation [ 4.10 ] we find the following
relation between internal and external densities :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath               
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.24)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the density deficit within the flux tubes. This density
deficit makes the flux tube move upward under the force of buoyancy. The
upward velocity @xmath of the flux tubes is given by the equality of the
buoyancy force with the aerodynamic drag force per unit area of the flux
tube :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the characteristic radius of the flux tube and @xmath is
the acceleration due to gravity. Therefore, the velocity is :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the time-scale required for a flux-tube to traverse the density
scale-height is :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

It should be noted that the characteristic scale length of the flux
tubes is again that of the density scale-height, and therefore,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

The time-scale for the reconnection of the field lines, on the other
hand, is typically given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.29)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where, @xmath are the Alfvén and the sound speed, respectively. @xmath
is the length-scale of the instability which is again of the order of
the density scale height in the accretion column. Within the accretion
column the sound speed is always much greater than the Alfvén velocity
and therefore only the top expressions of the above equations are
relevant here. At the flow density, the Alfvén velocity is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore, the expressions for the reconnection time-scale is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.31)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

For the screening to be effective, the total time taken to create a loop
of field lines by turn-over instability and to destroy the loop by
reconnection has to be much larger than the screening time-scale defined
above. So we define an instability time-scale as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

which should be compared with @xmath . It must be noted here that we use
the ‘pressure scale-height’ and ‘density scale-height’ interchangeably
in the above discussion since for barotropic (atmospheric) equation of
state (as is the case here) a pressure gradient implies the same density
gradient.

Therefore the three relevant time-scales of the problem are :

-   screening time-scale - given by equation [ 4.19 ];

-   diffusive time-scale - given by equation [ 4.20 ]; and

-   instability time-scale - given by equation [ 4.33 ].

In figure[ 4.2 ] we plot all the time-scales as functions of surface
field strength and the accretion rate.

### 4.4 discussion and conclusions

Looking at the figures plotted above, obtained for a range of values for
the accretion rate and the surface field strength, we find that,

1.  The density of flow increases with an increase in the field
    strength. The larger the field, the deeper and denser it gets buried
    (see figure [ 4.1 ]). The flow density also has a mild positive
    dependence on the rate of mass accretion. But even for very large
    values of the surface field strength the flow does not occur at
    densities beyond @xmath . That means the flow always takes place
    within the liquid layer. And the earlier contentions of a burial
    within the solid layer does not really happen.

2.  As the screening time-scales are always much smaller than the
    diffusive time-scales a condition of flux-freezing prevails and
    material movement indeed should proceed dragging the field lines
    along.

3.  But, since the instability time-scale (sum of the overturn and the
    re-connection time-scales) is much too smaller than the other two
    time-scales of the problem, any stretching of field line is quickly
    restored (over the instability time-scale) and the material
    effectively flows past the field lines without causing any change.

We find that the time-scale of overturn and reconnection is so much
smaller than any other time-scale of the problem that it is not at all
possible to create horizontal field components at the cost of vertical
ones and effect a screening. Therefore, it is not possible to screen the
magnetic field of a neutron star by the accreting material in order to
reduce the magnitude of the external dipole observed.

## Chapter 5 evolution of crustal magnetic field in an accreting neutron
star

### 5.1 introduction

It has been discussed in chapter [ 3 ] that observations suggest a
connection between the low magnetic field of binary and millisecond
pulsars and their being processed in binary systems, indicating
accretion-induced field decay in such systems. A possible mechanism for
such decay is understood to be the rapid ohmic dissipation of the
currents in the accretion heated crust (see section [ 3.3 ] for
details). In this work we explore models that primarily depend on this
microscopic process of ohmic decay for a permanent reduction in the
observed field strength, and also on the large scale material movement
for the final stabilization of the field. Here we shall investigate a
model based on the assumption that the current loops responsible for the
magnetic field are initially confined entirely within the crust. This
situation is likely to be the result of a generation of the field due to
thermo-magnetic instabilities after the birth of the star (see section [
3.2 ] for details). If the initial field resides mainly in the
superconducting core then our scenario would apply only after most of
this flux has been expelled into the crust, a situation which will be
treated in chapter [7].

The crustal field undergoes ohmic diffusion due to the finite electrical
conductivity of the crustal lattice, but the time-scale of such decay is
very long under ordinary conditions [ Sang & ChanmugamSang &
Chanmugam1987 , Urpin & MuslimovUrpin & Muslimov1992b ] . The situation
changes significantly when accretion is turned on. The heating of the
crust reduces the electrical conductivity by several orders of
magnitude, thereby reducing the ohmic decay time-scale. As the mass
increases, a neutron star becomes more and more compact and the mass of
the crust actually decreases by a small amount (see section [ 2.2 ]). So
the newly accreted material forms the crust and the original crustal
material gets continually assimilated into the superconducting core
beneath. The original current carrying layers are thus pushed into
deeper and more dense regions as accretion proceeds. This compression
results in a decrease of the effective length scale of the current loops
which makes a fast dissipation possible [ Konar, Bhattacharya, &
UrpinKonar et al.1995 ] . But the higher conductivity of the denser
regions would progressively slow down the decay winning over the effect
of a decrease in the length scale, till the current loops are completely
inside the superconducting region where any further decay is prevented.

The organization of the chapter is as follows. In section [ 5.2 ] we
discuss the physics of the field reduction in an accreting neutron star,
computational details are discussed in section [ 5.3 ]. Finally in
section [ 5.4 ] we present our results and draw the conclusions in
section [ 5.5 ].

### 5.2 physics of the mechanism

The evolution of the crustal field as a result of ohmic diffusion and
material motion has been discussed by a number of authors [ Wendell, van
Horn, & SargentWendell et al.1987 , Sang & ChanmugamSang & Chanmugam1987
, Geppert & UrpinGeppert & Urpin1994 ] and essentially concerns the
solution of the following equation [ JacksonJackson1975 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the velocity of material movement and @xmath is the
electrical conductivity of the medium. As in previous studies we solve
this equation by introducing the vector potential @xmath , such that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where, @xmath . This choice of the vector potential ensures a poloidal
geometry for @xmath . In particular, we choose

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

@xmath being the spherical polar co-ordinates. Here we work in the
lowest order of multipole, obtaining the following dipolar form of the
magnetic field :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.4)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

The magnitude of the field is given by,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, at the pole ( @xmath , @xmath ) the magnitude is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is simply proportional to the value of the Stokes’ function there.
We shall use this fact to obtain the evolution of the surface field with
time.

The underlying current distribution corresponding to the above field is
obtained by using Maxwell’s equation :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.7)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

#### 5.2.1 ohmic diffusion

In order to understand the ohmic dissipation of the field strength, let
us consider equation [ 5.1 ] without the first term on the right hand
side. The first term corresponds to the convective transport, which we
shall discuss later. Without this term equation [ 5.1 ] takes the
following form,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

For the moment, let us consider the conductivity to be a constant,
without any dependence on space. Then, the above equation takes the form
of a pure diffusion equation (by virtue of the divergence-free condition
for the magnetic fields), given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

The diffusion constant for the above equation is @xmath . One can define
a time-scale characteristic of the diffusion process :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the length-scale associated with the underlying current
distribution supporting the field.

It is clear from equation [ 5.10 ] that the rate of ohmic diffusion is
determined mainly by the electrical conductivity of the crust which is a
steeply increasing function of density (see figures in section [ 2.4 ]).
As density in the crust spans eight orders of magnitude with a very
large radial gradient the conductivity changes sharply as a function of
depth from the neutron star surface. Thus the deeper the location of the
current distribution, the slower is the decay. We have discussed, in
detail, the effects of temperature and that of impurity concentration on
the conductivity in section [ 2.4 ], also about the change in the
thermal behaviour in presence of accretion in a neutron star in section
[ 2.3 ]. The increase in temperature of an accretion-heated crust lowers
the conductivity and therefore the time-scale for the diffusion
decreases. In other words, the transfer of the energy of the systematic
motion of the charge carriers (the electrons) within the current loops
into the random kinetic energy of the electrons proceed at a faster rate
at a higher temperature. For the models we are considering now, it has
been assumed in the literature that the impurity strength @xmath lies in
the range 0.01 - 0.1. The effect of impurities is most important at
lower temperatures and higher densities (see figures [ 2.21 ] and [ 2.22
]). Therefore the field evolution does not show any significant
dependence on impurity strength for this range of @xmath in an
accretion-heated crust. We therefore restrict our computations to the
@xmath case. However, the impurity strength will still play an important
role in field decay during the pre-accretion phase when the crustal
temperatures can be quite low.

#### 5.2.2 accretion and material transport

In a neutron star, for a given equation of state, the mass of the crust
is uniquely determined by the total mass of the star (see section [ 2.2
]). And this crustal mass remains effectively constant for the accreted
masses of the order of 0.1 M @xmath with a slight decrease as the total
mass increases (see figures [ 2.14 ], [ 2.15 ] and [ 2.16 ]). For
example, for the equation of state that we have used (see section [ 2.1
] for details) the accretion of 0.1 M @xmath on the star causes a change
in the crustal mass of only 0.004 M @xmath . As a result, accretion
causes continuous assimilation of material from the bottom of the crust
into the core. At the same time the upper layers of the original crust
are pushed to deeper and denser regions, leading to extreme squeeze of
this material. This also causes the current distribution embedded in
this material to be sharpened, reducing the effective length scale of
the system.

The change in the crustal mass and the crustal density profile is
negligible for the amount of mass accretion we consider. We therefore
take the mass flux to be the same throughout the crust, equal to its
value at the surface. Assuming the mass flow to be spherically symmetric
in the crustal layers of interest, one the obtains the following
condition for the equality of mass flux at all densities within the
crust,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.11)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where is the rate of mass accretion and @xmath is the density as a
function of radius @xmath . The above equation defines @xmath - the
velocity of radial material flow at a given radius in the crust. It
should be noted here that the material flow is radially inwards, hence
writing the flow velocity in its full vectorial form we have,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

The result of accretion on the magnetic field evolution therefore
manifests itself as a combination of three effects: transport of the
current distribution to regions of higher density and hence higher
conductivity, reduction of conductivity due to heating and change in the
effective length scale of the current distribution (see \citeNP db95a
for a detailed discussion). We find that the overall effect turns out to
be a rapid initial decay followed by a leveling off when an amount of
mass equivalent to about 10% of the original crust has been accreted. By
this time the current loops reach the regions of very high density and
consequently of extremely large conductivity where the diffusion
time-scales are much too long. As further accretion proceeds the
original crust is assimilated into the superconducting interior freezing
the currents there. Following \citeN baym69b we assume that the newly
formed superconducting material retains the magnetic flux through it in
the form of Abrikosov fluxoids rather than expelling it through the
Meissner effect.

#### 5.2.3 the field evolution equation

We use the form of @xmath given by equation [ 5.4 ] and the form of
@xmath given by equation [ 5.12 ] to cast equation [ 5.1 ] in terms of
the Stokes’ function.

1.  The left hand side –

      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.13)
                           @xmath   @xmath   
      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

2.  The first term in the right hand side –

      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.14)
                           @xmath   @xmath   
      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

3.  The second term in the right hand side –

      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.15)
                           @xmath   @xmath   
      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Incorporation of the expressions [ 5.13 ], [ 5.14 ] and [ 5.15 ] in the
equation[ 5.1 ] then leads to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

The results of this chapter will be based on numerical solutions of the
equation [ 5.16 ].

### 5.3 computations

The aim of our computations is to solve equation [ 5.16 ] to obtain
@xmath using the following boundary conditions valid for all times (see,
e.g., Geppert & Urpin 1994):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.17)
     @xmath      (5.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is radius of the star and @xmath is that radius to which
the original boundary between the core and the crust is pushed to, due
to accretion, at any point of time. The first condition matches the
interior field to an external dipole configuration. The second condition
indicates that as accretion proceeds along with the crustal material the
frozen-in flux moves inside the core, but the field can not diffuse
through the original crust-core boundary. To simulate an effectively
infinite conductivity in the region between the bottom of the crust and
the original boundary between the crust and the core, we set @xmath in
this region. As mentioned before, we take into account the combined
effects of accretion driven material motion and ohmic diffusion. We
construct the density profile of a neutron star as described in section
[ 2.2 ] for an assumed mass of 1.4 . This star has a total crustal mass
of 0.044 and we restrict our evolutionary calculations to a maximum net
accretion of this additional amount on the star, because an accretion of
that amount of material pushes the original crust completely within the
core. The change in the crustal density profile resulting from this
additional mass is negligible. Hence we work with an invariant crustal
density profile throughout our calculation.

We assume that the matter settling onto the star does so uniformly
across the entire surface. This allows us to use the expression of
@xmath as in equation [ 5.11 ]. When the surface magnetic field is
strong this is a poor approximation very close to the surface (see the
discussion about anisotropic material transport in section [ 4.2 ]
However in deeper layers ( @xmath ) which we are mainly concerned with,
the material motion is essentially dictated by the added weight and is
going to be more or less isotropic.

We further assume that the incoming matter fully threads the existing
magnetic field before settling onto the surface. In other words we allow
for no reduction of the external magnetic field arising out of
diamagnetic screening by the incoming material. We adopt this scheme to
ensure that the effects under investigation here, namely diffusion and
convection, do not get masked by other effects such as screening. In the
light of the results obtained in the previous chapter regarding
diamagnetic screening, we are quite justified in making such an
assumption.

We assume that during the phase of mass accretion the temperature in the
crust is uniform and remains constant in time. This ignores an initial
short phase in which both the rate of accretion and the temperature of
the crust show time evolution. The rate of accretion stabilizes in a few
thousand years [ SavonijeSavonije1978 ] and the temperature within
@xmath yrs [ Miralda-Escude, Paczynski, & HaenselMiralda-Escude
et al.1990 ] . Computations by \citeN urpn96 show that the decay during
this initial phase is insignificant. The temperature that the crust will
finally attain in the steady phase has been computed by \citeN fuji84,
\citeN mira90 and \citeN zdun92. However, these computations are
restricted to limited range of mass accretion and also do not yield the
same crustal temperature under similar conditions. The results obtained
by \citeN zdun92 for the crustal temperatures for a given accretion rate
in the range @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath @xmath @xmath @xmath @xmath M
@xmath yr @xmath could be fitted to the equation [ 2.12 ]. But
extrapolation of this fit to higher rates of accretion gives extremely
high temperatures which may not be sustainable for any reasonable period
due to rapid cooling by neutrinos at those temperatures. We have
therefore restricted our computations to a maximum accretion rate of
@xmath M @xmath yr @xmath and for @xmath in the range @xmath – @xmath M
@xmath yr @xmath , we have explored a range of constant crustal
temperatures between @xmath and @xmath K.

In a series of papers \citeN gepp94, \citeN urpn95, \citeN urpn96 and
\citeN gepp96 have considered evolution of crustal magnetic field for
accretion rates in the range @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath . In this work we
too consider accretion rates covering much of the above range. The
difference between our computations and those in the above papers lies
in the range of total mass accretion and the treatment of the inner
boundary condition. Our computations proceed to a maximum net accretion
of @xmath M @xmath whereas the computations by other authors are
restricted to that of the order of @xmath M @xmath . Our choice of the
range of accretion rates also facilitates the comparison of our results
with those available in the literature, over the range of overlap in the
net mass accreted. At accreted masses @xmath , the inward convection of
currents into the core becomes significant. As computations by previous
authors do not allow for this possibility, our results begin to diverge
from theirs for high values of accreted mass.

#### 5.3.1 numerical scheme

We solve the equation [ 5.16 ] in terms of fractional radius, @xmath ,
instead of the radius. Re-writing this equation in terms of the
fractional radius, we obtain,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

where,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.20)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.21)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

To solve the above equation we use a modified Crank-Nicholson scheme.
Since the conductivity is a function of density and hence of radius, it
has been necessary to incorporate the space dependence of conductivity
in the standard Crank-Nicholson scheme of differencing. In addition we
also allow for a pre-accretion phase where the neutron star undergoes
normal cooling. This introduces a time-dependence in the temperature and
hence in the diffusion-constant as well. The overall effect is to
consider an explicit space-time dependence of the function @xmath which
is a pre-factor to the diffusion term. We introduce the convection term
into the computation through upwind differencing and operator splitting
of the full differential equation [ Press et al.Press et al.1988 ] .

Using the method of operator splitting, we first find out the
differenced form of the equation,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

by upwind differencing , to obtain,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

where, @xmath and @xmath represent the time interval and the size of the
space-grid. The superscript @xmath stand for the @xmath -th time-step
and the subscript @xmath stand for the @xmath -th space-grid of
integration. Similarly, for the diffusive part, given by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

we use Crank-Nicholson scheme to obtain,

  -- -- -- --------
           (5.25)
  -- -- -- --------

where the various symbols have the same meaning as in equation [ 5.23 ].
To incorporate the time-dependence of @xmath without making the
differencing scheme too complicated, we use the time-averaged (over two
neighbouring intervals) value of the function at each time-step. This
does not introduce too much error as the function is slowly-varying over
the time-intervals typically chosen for our integrations. In the end we
combine the schemes in the following manner,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.26)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

to obtain the final differenced form of the equation [ 5.16 ] which is
used in the numerical code.

In connection with the numerical code an important point needs to be
mentioned. It is imperative, before it is used to obtain results, to
check for the stability of the numerical scheme employed. The
Crank-Nicholson scheme of differencing is unconditionally stable for any
size of the temporal or spatial grid. Hence any instability in our
scheme arises from the convective part for which the scheme used (upwind
differencing) is, unlike the other scheme, not stable for all
combinations of the spatial and temporal intervals. The stability of
this scheme depends on whether the Courant condition is satisfied or
not. This condition demands that the inequality

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

be satisfied at all grid points and at all points of time. Using
equations [ 5.11 ] and [ 5.21 ] to arrive at the values of @xmath for a
given rate of accretion and for a space-grid of 100 points we find that
for an accretion rate of @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath (which is roughly the
Eddington rate of accretion for a 1.4 neutron star) the maximum
time-interval allowable by the Courant condition is @xmath years. This
of course places a severe constraint on computational resources in terms
of run-time.

In equation [ 5.16 ] above, the convective and the diffusive terms
dominate the evolution in different density ranges. To illustrate this
fact, similar to the diffusive time-scale defined in equation [ 5.10 ],
we define a convective time-scale :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the system size as before. In figure [ 5.1 ] we plot the
relative magnitude of these two time-scales defined by the coefficient,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

This plot is made for an assumed accretion rate of @xmath M @xmath yr
@xmath . It is clear from this figure that both in the low density
regions near the surface and in the deep high density regions it is the
diffusive term that is more important. Only in the intermediate regions
the effect of convection becomes significant.

### 5.4 results and discussions

The results are summarized in a series of figures.

Figure [ 5.2 ] shows the distribution of the @xmath -function and figure
[ 5.3 ] the toroidal currents, @xmath , assumed at the starting point of
the field evolution.

Field decay due to pure diffusion in an isolated neutron star is shown
in figures [ 5.4 ] and [ 5.6 ]. In computing this, neutron star cooling
according to the results of van Riper \citeyear ripe91a,ripe91b
(reproduced here in figure [ 5.5 ]) for normal matter in 1.4 M @xmath
Friedman & Pandharipande \citeyear frie81 model star has been used. It
is to be noted that our adopted equation of state, namely, that of
\citeN wiri88 is an updated version of Friedman & Pandharipande equation
of state with only minor differences. Among the published cooling curves
this is the nearest to that appropriate to our adopted neutron star
model. Computations similar to the one displayed in figures [ 5.4 ] and
[ 5.6 ] have been made by \citeN urpn92a and our result matches very
closely with theirs. It is evident from the figure [ 5.6 ] that the net
decay decreases with the increasing density at which the initial current
configuration is centred at. This is expected as the diffusive
time-scales are larger at higher densities owing to larger
conductivities there.

Figure [ 5.7 ] displays the result of the convection due to material
movement alone. We obtain this by setting the conductivity @xmath to an
artificially high value of @xmath s @xmath in our code. It shows the
migration of @xmath -profile to regions of higher density (and
consequent sharpening of the profile). The field at the surface ( @xmath
) remains constant under pure convection according to our assumptions.

Figure [ 5.8 ] shows the results of the combined effects of convection
and diffusion on the @xmath -function, in other words the full evolution
described by equation [ 5.16 ], for a particular value of the accretion
rate.

In section [ 5.2.2 ] we have mentioned that accretion induces
compression of the crustal layers and hence effect a reduction of the
effective length-scale of the current profile. In figures [ 5.4 ], [ 5.7
] and [ 5.8 ] we have seen how the @xmath -profile evolves due to pure
diffusion, pure convection and a combination of both. Here, in figure [
5.9 ] we plot the change of the length-scale of the @xmath -profile with
time in each of the above-mentioned cases. As an estimate of the
effective length-scale of the current distribution we use the width
(defined as the separation between the peak of the distribution and a
point which has 1% of the peak magnitude) of the @xmath -profile. Though
this is but a crude estimate, it nevertheless serves the purpose of
illustrating the qualitative nature of the change of the length-scale.
The curves for pure diffusion and pure convection show monotonous
increase and decrease respectively. Even though the curve for the case
of actual accretion (where both diffusion and convection are present)
the nature is again that of a monotonic increase in length scale similar
to the case of pure diffusion, it rises comparatively slowly initially.
This is due to the fact that the convective compression slows the
diffusive spreading. Of course, in the end the diffusive spreading
becomes faster than the case of pure diffusion due to heating which
lowers the conductivity.

In figure [ 5.10 ] we display the evolution of the surface field for
different values of @xmath , with temperatures obtained from equation [
2.12 ] over its validity range and for three different assumed
temperatures at the highest accretion rate. All the curves in this
figure refer to an initial @xmath -profile that is centred at a density
of @xmath . In figures [ 5.11 ], [ 5.12 ], [ 5.13 ] and [ 5.14 ] we plot
similar curves for different densities at which the initial current
profiles are centred. In figure [ 5.15 ] we display the final surface
field values obtained as a function of the rate of accretion for
different values of initial current concentration densities.

The following features emerge from the behaviour displayed in these
figures:

1.  The general nature of the decay corresponds to an initial rapid
    phase exhibiting a power law behaviour for the most part with an
    index ranging from 0.1 to 0.46 (i.e., @xmath ), followed by a short
    exponential phase and then a freezing, which stabilizes the surface
    field. This stability is the result of the current distribution
    responsible for the field moving to highly conducting parts of the
    star, much of it migrating into the core. According to our adopted
    scenario, the ohmic time scale in the core is much longer than the
    Hubble time and hence the surface field at this stage will
    essentially be stable forever. We refer to this surface field as the
    ‘residual field’ .

2.  The duration of the exponential phase and consequently the value of
    the magnetic field at which freezing occurs is a strong function of
    the accretion rate. The higher the accretion rate the sooner the
    freezing sets in resulting in a higher value of the ‘residual
    field’. This effect can be understood as follows. As explained by
    Bhattacharya \citeyear db95a the decay behaviour turns from a power
    law to an exponential, once the diffused @xmath -distribution
    reaches nearly the bottom of the crust. The transition from there to
    the frozen state happens by further accretion of matter which pushes
    the crustal material into the core. The time required for this final
    transition is of course dependent on the accretion rate and the
    higher the accretion rate the smaller it is. For a rate of accretion
    of @xmath M @xmath /yr, this exponential phase is nearly absent.

3.  The dependence of the decay on the crustal temperature is as
    expected, namely, the decay proceeds faster at a higher temperature.

4.  In figure [ 5.15 ] we have plotted the final ’frozen field’ for
    different rates of accretion corresponding to different densities at
    which the initial current profile is centred at. It is clearly seen
    from this figure that the lower the rate of accretion, the lower is
    the final ‘frozen in’ field.

5.  In figure [ 5.16 ] the evolution of the surface magnetic field as a
    function of total accreted mass has been plotted for different rates
    of accretion. Corresponding to a given accretion rate the crustal
    temperature has been obtained from equation [ 2.12 ]. It is observed
    that the freezing in of the field occurs for larger accreted mass
    for higher rates of accretion. The high accretion rate also ensures
    quicker material transport to higher densities, causing the field
    strength to level off at a higher value. Another important point to
    note here is that unlike what is assumed in heuristic evolutionary
    models [ Taam & van de HeuvelTaam & van de Heuvel1986 , Shibazaki
    et al.Shibazaki et al.1989 , van den Heuvel & Bitzarakivan den
    Heuvel & Bitzaraki1995 ] the amount of field decay is dependent not
    only on the total mass accreted but also on the accretion rate
    itself. Once the accreted mass exceeds @xmath M @xmath , the final
    magnetic field strength is decided only by the rate at which this
    mass was accreted. Whereas figure [ 5.16 ] correspond to an initial
    profile centred at @xmath , in the figures [ 5.17 ], [ 5.18 ], [
    5.19 ] and [ 5.20 ] we plot similar curves for different densities.

6.  In practice a neutron star will often undergo a non-accreting phase
    of considerable duration before accretion can begin on its surface.
    During this initial phase its magnetic field will evolve as in an
    isolated neutron star, namely according to the evolution shown in
    figure [ 5.6 ]. This has important physical consequences for the
    evolution in the accretion phase. The diffusion in the pre-accretion
    phase causes the currents to already penetrate to deeper and denser
    regions of high conductivity. As a result the net decay achieved
    during subsequent accretion is lower. Figure [ 5.21 ] compares the
    evolution of the surface field without and with the pre-accretion
    phase lasting a billion years. It should also be noted that for
    accretion-induced field decay with an effectively isolated
    pre-accretion phase, the impurity concentration plays an important
    role too. Though the actual final field values obtained is lower for
    large @xmath , the decay experienced in the accretion phase is
    significantly less in such cases and the ‘ freezing ’ sets in much
    faster.

7.  As mentioned before, the range of conditions explored by us overlap
    with those in the work of \citeN urpn95, \citeN urpn96, \citeN
    gepp96 and goes beyond. We have performed detailed comparisons of
    our results with theirs in the overlap range. The agreement in
    general is found to be excellent giving us confidence in the
    validity of our approach.

To summarize, we have explored accretion-driven evolution of crustal
magnetic fields over a range of conditions not previously attempted in
the literature. The new behaviour revealed by these computations include
a near exponential decay of the surface field after the initial power
law phase and most importantly an eventual freezing. The ‘residual
field’ corresponding to this frozen state is a function of the accretion
rate and the temperature during the evolution. It is interesting to note
that for near-Eddington accretion rates, applicable to Roche-lobe
overflow phase in real binaries, the ‘residual field’ lies between
@xmath – @xmath of the original value. So, if the neutron star
originally started with a field strength of the order of @xmath G, this
would mean a final post-accretion field strength of @xmath – @xmath G,
exactly as observed in most recycled pulsars. Unfortunately, we have not
been able to treat accretion rates equal to or larger than Eddington in
the present work due to lack of knowledge about the crustal temperatures
at those accretion rates. But judging by the dependence of the behaviour
on accretion rates (see figure 5.15 ]) it appears that even somewhat
higher post-accretion field strengths might be possible under such
conditions. Recycled pulsars with the strongest magnetic fields, namely
PSR 0820+02 and PSR 2303+46 have, according to evolutionary scenarios [
Bhattacharya & van den HeuvelBhattacharya & van den Heuvel1991 ] ,
undergone super-Eddington mass transfers. Their field strengths would
therefore be in agreement with the trend described above.

### 5.5 conclusions

In this chapter we have explored the evolution of the crustal magnetic
field of accreting neutron stars. The combination of enhanced ohmic
diffusion due to crustal heating and the transport of current-carrying
layers to higher densities due to the accreted overburden, causes the
surface field strength to exhibit the following behaviour:

1.  An initial rapid decay (power law behaviour followed by exponential
    behaviour) followed by a leveling off (freezing),

2.  Faster onset of freezing at higher crustal temperatures and at a
    lower final value of the surface field,

3.  Lower final fields for lower rates of accretion for the same net
    amount of accretion,

4.  The longer the duration of the pre-accretion phase the less the
    amount of field decay during the accretion phase, and

5.  The deeper the initial current loops are the higher the final
    surface field.

## Chapter 6 comparison with observations

### 6.1 introduction

In the previous chapter we have discussed a model for the evolution of
the magnetic field in accreting neutron stars, assuming an initial
crustal flux. It has been borne out by our calculations that the model
possesses some essential features required to explain the origin of the
observed low-field pulsars. But in a broader perspective it is also
necessary for a model to explain the present paradigm of the field
evolution in its entirety. The astronomical objects that have so far
been unambiguously identified with neutron stars can be divided into two
distinct classes :

-   the radio pulsars, and

-   the X-ray binaries containing a neutron star.

Interestingly, observations suggest that a class of radio pulsars
descend from X-ray binaries, and neutron stars in X-ray binaries
themselves represent an evolutionary state beyond that of isolated radio
pulsars (see \citeNP db95b, \citeNP db96a, \citeNP heuv95, \citeNP
verb95 and references therein). Therefore the present belief is that
this evolutionary link can be understood within an unified picture of
evolution of their spin as well as the magnetic field. The
spin-evolution of the neutron stars in binary systems have been
investigated following the detailed binary evolution assuming some
simple model for the field evolution (see \citeNP verb95 (1995) and
references therein). In the present work we concentrate on the details
of the evolution of the magnetic field. We apply the model of field
evolution to isolated neutron stars as well as to those that are members
of binaries. Comparison of these results with observations allows us to
test the validity of the field evolution model.

Radio pulsars can be classified into two groups, namely the solitary
pulsars and the binary pulsars. The binary pulsars are again of two
types - the high mass binary pulsars and the low mass binary pulsars,
the reference to the masses being to those of the companions. It has
been suggested by recent statistical analyses that the fields of the
isolated neutron stars do not undergo any significant decay [
RudermanRuderman1991a , RudermanRuderman1991b , RudermanRuderman1991c ,
Bhattacharya & SrinivasanBhattacharya & Srinivasan1991 , Ding, Cheng, &
ChauDing et al.1993 , Jahan Miri & BhattacharyaJahan Miri &
Bhattacharya1994 , Jahan MiriJahan Miri1996 ] . On the other hand almost
all binary pulsars possess field values that are smaller than the
canonical field values observed in isolated pulsars. Usually the high
mass binary pulsars, of which the Hulse-Taylor pulsar is one famous
example, have field strengths in excess of @xmath Gauss, whereas the low
mass binary pulsars include both high-field pulsars and very low-field
objects like the millisecond pulsars. It must be noted here that when we
talk about the solitary pulsars we mean high-field solitary pulsars
without any history of binary association. The millisecond pulsars and
pulsars with obvious or suspected binary history are discussed along
with their binary counterparts for the sake of convenience. The present
belief regarding the evolutionary history of the binary pulsars is that
the high mass binary pulsars come from systems similar to the high mass
X-ray binaries whereas the low mass binaries are the progenies of the
low mass X-ray binaries. In the following table we present this
evolutionary scenario.

  ---------------- ----------------------- ----------------------------- ------------------------------

Even though the millisecond pulsars fall in the broader category of low
mass binary pulsars, we shall mention them separately due to their
unique characteristic features. The rotation powered radio pulsars
separated out into two distinct classes with the discovery of the 1.6 ms
pulsar, PSR 1937+21 [ Backer et al.Backer et al.1982 ] .In accordance
with the extremely small rotation periods ( @xmath ms) of this new
variety they came to be known as Millisecond Pulsars as opposed to the
population of normal pulsars that have longer rotation periods. Loosely,
the term millisecond pulsar refers to the class of pulsars with rotation
periods less than 20 ms. This definition, though somewhat ad-hoc,
actually serves the purpose of classification rather well. In other
words, all the members of the class of millisecond pulsars show
remarkable similarity in several of their characteristic physical
properties (listed below), which also serve to distinguish them from the
rest of the pulsar population.

The characteristic features of the millisecond pulsars could be
summarized as follows.

1.  fast rotation – P 20 ms;

2.  extremely small magnetic fields (three to four orders of magnitude
    smaller than the canonical field values observed in normal pulsars)
    – B @xmath G;

3.  binary association – 90% of the disc population and 50% of the
    Globular Cluster population of the millisecond pulsars have low-mass
    binary companions, with most probable mass of the companion @xmath ,
    in nearly circular orbits;

4.  old age – age determination from the presence in the Globular
    Cluster or from the surface temperature measurements of a white
    dwarf companion (e.g., for PSR 1855+09) indicate a lifetime of
    @xmath years or more [ Hansen & PhinneyHansen & Phinney1997 ] .

It has been shown that a total mass of @xmath is required to be accreted
to achieve millisecond period through accretion induced spin-up. Present
theories of binary evolution predict that the only systems capable of
supporting mass-transfer long enough (about @xmath years at the
Eddington rate of accretion) to allow the neutron stars to accrete
@xmath are the ones with low-mass ( @xmath ) donors (the Low Mass X-ray
Binaries or LMXBs in short). Hence, it is generally believed that the
evolutionary link between a normal radio pulsar and its millisecond
counterpart is through a phase of binary processing in LMXBs. In general
the companion of a binary pulsar is indicative of the system from which
it originated. A pulsar with neutron star or a massive ( @xmath ) white
dwarf companion is understood to have come from a system containing a
massive ( @xmath ) donor. Similarly, a pulsar with a low mass ( @xmath )
white dwarf companion must originate in a low mass X-ray binary. All the
binary millisecond pulsars have low mass companions, indicating their
origin in low-mass systems.

At this stage, it becomes imperative that the models for evolution of
the magnetic field be consistent with the spin-evolution scenario. There
is, as yet, no consensus about the models of field evolution or about
those of the origin and structure of the field. Based on the two
theories of field generation and the corresponding internal structures
(see section [ 3.2 ]) one can broadly classify the models of field
evolution into two categories. The original theory of recycling assumed
a spontaneous ohmic decay of magnetic field with age, which according to
the present evidence, appears unlikely. For a magnetic flux confined to
the core, the model of spindown-induced flux expulsion has been explored
[ Jahan Miri & BhattacharyaJahan Miri & Bhattacharya1994 , Jahan
MiriJahan Miri1996 , Bhattacharya & DattaBhattacharya & Datta1996 ] , We
shall discuss this model in the next chapter.

In this chapter, we confront the field evolution model of chapter [5],
namely that of assuming an initial crustal flux, with observations of
both isolated neutron stars and neutron stars in binary systems. In
particular, we address the question of millisecond pulsar generation
purely from the point of view of the field evolution. Our results are
consistent with the general view that millisecond pulsars come from low
mass x-ray binaries. We also find that the neutron stars processed in
high mass x-ray binaries would retain fairly high field strengths in
conformity with what is observed in high mass radio pulsars.

In section [ 6.3 ] we discuss the nature of field evolution of a neutron
star vis-a-vis the binary evolution of the system which it is a member
of. Section [ 6.4 ] elaborates the computational details. We present our
results in section [ 6.5 ] and the conclusions in section [ 6.6 ].

### 6.2 field evolution in solitary neutron stars

According to modern statistical analyses the isolated neutron stars do
not undergo any significant field reduction over their active pulsar
life time [ Bhattacharya et al.Bhattacharya et al.1992 , Wakatsuki
et al.Wakatsuki et al.1992 , Hartman et al.Hartman et al.1997 ] . In an
isolated neutron star the field decreases due to pure ohmic dissipation
of the current loops in the crust. We have already mentioned that the
diffusive time-scale is dependent on three factors, namely

-   the density at which the initial current loops are located,

-   the impurity content of the crust, and

-   the temperature of the crust.

We shall look at the effect of all these factors and determine the
acceptable ranges for these parameters for which the final field
strengths are within the limits of statistical uncertainty.

An isolated neutron star cools down after its birth chiefly by copious
neutrino emission. It has recently been shown (see Page, 1998 and
references therein for details) that there are lots of uncertainties in
this regard. The data could be made to fit both the ‘standard’ cooling
and the ‘accelerated’ cooling with appropriate assumptions regarding the
state of the stellar interior. Therefore, for the sake of completeness,
we have looked at both the cases - with standard and accelerated
cooling. The actual behaviour of the system is most likely to be
something in between. We have used data from Urpin & van Riper (private
communication) for both standard and accelerated cooling. In figure [
6.1 ] the two cooling curves have been shown for a comparison.

### 6.3 field evolution in neutron stars with binary companions

#### 6.3.1 binary and spin evolution

From the point of view of the interaction between the two stars, the
binaries, in general, go through three distinct phases of evolution as
detailed below.

1.  The Isolated Phase - Though the stars are gravitationally bound,
    there is no mass transfer. Therefore both the spin and the magnetic
    field evolve as they would in an isolated pulsar. The spin undergoes
    a pure dipole slow-down during this phase.

2.  The Wind Phase - The interaction is through the stellar wind of the
    companion which is likely to be in its main-sequence. In this phase
    the interaction of the wind material with the magnetosphere of the
    neutron star proceeds in two distinct sequences. In the early stages
    of the wind phase the magnetospheric interaction brings about a
    spin-down of the neutron star in the following manner. In the
    accretion disc the matter rotates with a Keplerian velocity at every
    point within the disc. When the matter arrives at the magnetospheric
    boundary of the star (determined roughly by the Alfvén radius where
    the magnetic pressure equals the ram pressure of the incoming
    material) the magnetic field starts controlling the material flow
    dynamics. This point onwards the field forces the material to
    co-rotate with the star. If the Keplerian velocity of the incoming
    material is smaller than the co-rotation velocity at the Alfvén
    radius then the material, in being forced to co-rotate with the star
    there, extracts angular momentum from the star thereby slowing it
    down. This material then gets expelled from the magnetosphere which
    has given this situation the name propeller phase . For ‘spin-down
    induced flux expulsion’ models the ‘propeller phase’ is the most
    crucial for the field evolution because it is in this phase that a
    significant flux expulsion is achieved due to a rapid spin-down of
    the star. Once the star has been spun-down sufficiently the
    Keplerian velocity at Alfvén radius becomes larger than the
    co-rotation velocity. In this case the accreting material loses
    angular momentum as it reaches Alfvén radius, spinning the star up.
    This material eventually reaches the polar cap of the star by moving
    along the field lines and gets deposited there. Therefore, this is
    the phase in which there is actual mass accretion by the star. An
    equilibrium is reached when the co-rotation speed equals the
    Keplerian speed at the magnetospheric boundary, i.e, at the Alfvén
    radius. This equilibrium condition then determines the maximum
    spin-up for a given rate of accretion and a given strength of the
    surface field, through the following relation [ Alpar et al.Alpar
    et al.1982 , Chen & RudermanChen & Ruderman1993 ]

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (6.1)
      -- -------- -- -------

    where @xmath is the surface field in @xmath Gauss, @xmath is the
    mass of the star, is the rate of accretion and @xmath is the radius
    of the star in units of 10 km. Therefore, the wind phase has two
    distinct sub-phases, namely - the propeller phase and the phase of
    actual wind accretion. It must be noted here that the duration of
    these two sub-phases vary widely from system to system and the phase
    of actual wind accretion may not at all be realized in some cases.
    For models based on an initial crustal field configuration, the
    phase of wind accretion and the subsequent phase of Roche contact
    play the all-important role.

3.  The Roche-contact Phase - When the companion of the neutron star
    fills its Roche-lobe a phase of heavy mass transfer ( @xmath )
    ensues. Though short-lived in case of HMXBs ( @xmath years), this
    phase can last as long as @xmath years for LMXBs. Consequently, this
    phase is very important for field evolution in LMXBs.

The nature of the binary evolution is well studied in the case of the
LMXBs where the mass transfer proceeds in a controlled manner. The same
is true for the wind phase in the HMXBs. But the exact nature of mass
transfer in the common-envelope phase, due to Roche-lobe overflow, has
not been studied in any detail yet. Still, due to the short-lived nature
this phase does not affect the field evolution significantly and
therefore the lack of precise knowledge does not affect our calculations
much. On the other hand, not much attention has been paid to the
evolution of the intermediate systems with companion masses in the range
@xmath 2 - 5 M @xmath . They are most likely to have an intermediate
nature in that the wind phase is prolonged and the accretion rates are
similar to those in the wind phase of low-mass systems, whereas, the
Roche-contact phase is perhaps similar to that in HMXBs. In either of
the phases it would be difficult to observe these systems, owing to the
low luminosity in the wind phase and due to the short-lived nature of
the Roche-contact phase. Moreover, in HMXBs and intermediate mass
binaries Roche-contact would usually lead to a common-envelope
evolution. In this phase the neutron star is engulfed by the common
envelope and the X-ray flux is hidden from the view. So far no
intermediate-mass system has been observed in the X-ray phase. As for
the pulsars processed in them, there are perhaps three examples PSR
B0655+64, PSR J2145-0750 and PSR J1022+1001 [ Camilo et al.Camilo
et al.1996 ] . But because of the uncertainties surrounding their mass
transfer history we exclude this kind of binaries from the present
discussion.

### 6.4 computations

Using the methodology developed in chapter [ 5 ] we solve equation [
5.16 ] following the mass-transfer history on neutron stars n high-mass
and low-mass binary systems. For the case of isolated pulsars we solve
the following equation,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

For all of the above cases we shall assume an initial crustal current
configuration (the kind that has been used in chapter [ 5 ]).

#### 6.4.1 binary parameters

The binary evolution parameters for the LMXBs and the HMXBs used by us
are as follows [ VerbuntVerbunt1990 , Bhattacharya & van den
HeuvelBhattacharya & van den Heuvel1991 , van den Heuvel & Bitzarakivan
den Heuvel & Bitzaraki1995 , King et al.King et al.1995 ] -

1.  Low Mass X-ray Binaries -

    1.  Isolated phase - Though binaries with narrow orbits may not have
        too-long-lived a phase of completely detached evolution, long
        period binaries (like the progenitor system of PSR 0820+02 with
        @xmath 250 day orbital period \citeNP verb95) may spend longer
        than @xmath years before contact is established. In general, the
        isolated phase lasts between @xmath years.

    2.  Wind phase - This phase again lasts for about @xmath years with
        attendant rates of accretion ranging from about @xmath M @xmath
        yr @xmath to @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath .

    3.  Roche-contact phase - In this phase, the mass transfer rate
        could be as high as the Eddington rate ( @xmath M @xmath yr
        @xmath for a 1.4 neutron star), lasting for @xmath years. But
        there has been recent indications that the low-mass binaries may
        even spend @xmath years in the Roche-contact phase with a
        sub-Eddington accretion rate [ Hansen & PhinneyHansen &
        Phinney1997 ] . For wide binaries, however, the contact phase
        may last as little as @xmath years. We have investigated the
        cases with accretion rates of @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath and
        @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath . With a higher accretion rate the
        material movement is faster and therefore the ‘freezing-in’
        takes place earlier (see figure [ 5.10 ]. Moreover, the equation
        [ 2.12 ], used by us to find the crustal temperature for a given
        rate of accretion, gives temperatures that are too high for
        accretion rates above @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath . The neutrino
        cooling is likely to prevent the temperature from reaching such
        large values and therefore for high rates of accretion probably
        the crustal temperature would reach a maximum saturation value.
        In our calculations we assume that the temperature that could be
        attained by accretion-induced heating is @xmath K for an
        accretion rate of @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath . For reasons noted
        in the previous chapter we are unable to make detailed
        calculations for @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath .

2.  High Mass X-ray Binaries -

    1.  Isolated phase - This phase is short in binaries with a massive
        companion and may last as little as ten thousand years.

    2.  Wind phase - This phase is also relatively short (compared to
        the low-mass systems), lasting not more than @xmath years
        (equivalent to the main-sequence life time of the massive star),
        with accretion rates ranging from @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath to
        @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath .

    3.  Roche-contact phase - A rapid phase of Roche-lobe overflow
        follows the wind phase. The rate of mass shedding by the
        companion could be as high as one tenth of a solar mass per
        year, of which a tiny fraction is actually accreted by the
        neutron star (the maximum rate of acceptance being presumably
        equal to the Eddington rate). The duration of this phase is
        @xmath years.

We must mention here about the Globular Cluster binaries though we have
not performed any explicit calculations for such systems. The duration
and the rates of mass accretion vary widely depending on how the mass
transfer phase ends in such binaries. The mass transfer may end through
binary disruption, by the neutron star spiraling in or through a slow
turn off.

#### 6.4.2 thermal behaviour

The thermal behaviour of isolated pulsars and of those accreting
material from their binary companions differs from each other
significantly (for details see section[ 2.3 ]. Since crustal temperature
is one of the major factors controlling field evolution we need to
consider the thermal behaviour with some care. For a neutron star that
is a member of a binary, the thermal behaviour will be similar to that
of an isolated neutron star before the advent of actual mass transfer.
Therefore through the isolated and the propeller phase the neutron star
cools like an isolated one. In particular, in the low-mass systems the
duration of the isolated phase and the propeller phase could be quite
long and therefore is rather important in affecting the subsequent
evolution of the surface field. We have shown in the previous chapter
that a phase of field evolution in the isolated phase modifies the
subsequent evolution considerably. Therefore, it is necessary to take
into account the proper cooling history of the neutron star prior to the
establishment of contact with its binary companion. As mentioned before,
we investigate both the cases - with standard and accelerated cooling.
Of course, the isolated phase itself is of importance only in case of an
initial crustal field configuration, the topic of our discussion in the
present chapter. For initial currents supported in the superconducting
core, the crustal physics of the star is mostly irrelevant as the field
has not yet been expelled to the crust. When, in the course of binary
evolution, the neutron star actually starts to accrete mass - the
thermal behaviour changes from that characteristic of an isolated phase.
The crustal temperature then settles down to a steady value determined
by the accretion rate as given in equation [ 2.12 ].

#### 6.4.3 crustal physics

We have seen in chapter [ 5 ] that the field evolution stops as the
field freezes in when about 10% of the original crustal mass is
accreted. This happens due to the fact that by then the current loops
reach the regions of extremely high electrical conductivity. The mass of
the crust of a 1.4 neutron star, with our adopted equation of state, is
@xmath . Therefore, in the present investigation we stop our
evolutionary code when @xmath is accreted. From our results (presented
in section [ 6.5 ]) it is evident that the field evidently shows signs
of ‘freezing in’ when we stop our calculation. Of course, as we have
mentioned earlier, to achieve millisecond period about 0.1 solar mass
requires to be accreted. But once the field attains its ‘frozen-in’
value subsequent accretion does not affect it in any way. Therefore, the
final spin-period is determined by this value of the surface field in
accordance with equation [ 6.1 ].

### 6.5 results and discussions

#### 6.5.1 solitary neutron stars

Figure [ 6.2 ] shows the evolution of the surface field in an isolated
neutron star due to pure ohmic decay, for different densities at which
the initial current distribution is concentrated. We have seen it before
too, that the lower the density of current concentration the more rapid
is the decay of the field. This figure refers to a situation where the
impurity strength has been assumed to be zero. In figure [ 6.3 ] we plot
similar curves for the evolution of the surface field with an assumed
@xmath = 0.05. In this case the final field values are too small to be
consistent with the indication from the statistical analyses. We find
that the maximum value of @xmath that can be allowed is about 0.01 if
allow for a maximum decay by two orders of magnitude within solitary
pulsar active lifetime. In figures [ 6.4 ] and [ 6.5 ] we plot similar
curves assuming a fast cooling process for the thermal behaviour of the
star. It is seen that the decay is evidently much less than in the case
of the standard cooling. But even in this case the maximum @xmath value
permissible is about 0.05. This we shall see later that is in
contradiction with the requirements of a spin-down induced flux
expulsion model.

#### 6.5.2 high mass binaries

Figures [ 6.6 ] to [ 6.15 ] show the evolution of the surface field in
the HMXBs; for different values of the density at which the initial
current profile is centred at. Figures [ 6.6 ] to [ 6.10 ] correspond to
computations with standard cooling in the isolated phase, whereas
figures [ 6.11 ] to [ 6.15 ] correspond to calculations with an
accelerated cooling in the isolated phase. For all of these cases we
have assumed a Roche-contact phase lasting for @xmath years with an
uniform rate of accretion of @xmath M @xmath yr @xmath . Since the
Roche-contact phase is extremely short-lived, the actual field decay
takes place in the wind phase. In fact, the decay attained in the
Roche-contact phase is insignificant and is not quite visible in figures
[ 6.6 ] to [ 6.15 ]. In figure [ 6.16 ] we show an expanded version of
figure [ 6.6 ] highlighting this final phase.

From these figures it is evident that if the initial current
distribution is located at high densities the objects from high-mass
systems will retain fairly large final fields. Even for low density
current distributions, if the duration of the wind phase is not too long
- again high-field objects are produced. We expect these objects to show
up as recycled pulsars with relatively high fields and long periods like
PSR B1913+16 or PSR B1534+12. On the other hand, if the wind phase lasts
for about @xmath years, it is possible to obtain a significant field
decay for higher rates of accretion in that phase. But as the total mass
and hence the total angular momentum accreted is not sufficient to spin
the star up to very short periods, these systems probably would not
produce millisecond pulsars. In other words these so-called ‘recycled’
pulsars would have small magnetic fields with relatively long
spin-periods and therefore may not at all be active as pulsars. We make
an estimate of the actual spin-up for objects processed in high-mass
systems to check this fact.

The spin-up of a neutron star, in a binary system, is caused by the
angular momentum brought in by the accreted matter. In magnetospheric
accretion matter accretes with angular momentum specific to the Alfvén
radius. Therefore, the total angular momentum brought in by accretion is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the total mass accreted. @xmath and @xmath are the
Alfvén radius and Keplerian velocity at that radius given by equations [
4.9 ] and [ 4.5 ]. The final period of the neutron star then is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the moment of inertia of the neutron star. In figure [
6.18 ] we have indicated the possible location of the ‘recycled’ pulsars
originating in HMXBs. We find that for sufficiently low field strengths
( @xmath Gauss) the recycled pulsars indeed will be beyond the death
line. And active pulsars with slightly higher fields will lie very close
to the death line. Comparing this figure with the field-period diagram
of the observed pulsars (figure [ 6.17 ]) one does find pulsars like PSR
0655+64 to fall in this category. The cases of high-field pulsars well
above death line are also quite evident from this figure.

It should also be noted here that even though the nature of field
evolution is very different in the isolated phase for standard and
accelerated cooling, the final surface field values at the end of the
wind phase are not very different. This is due to the fact that the
nature of the field evolution is significantly influenced by previous
history. We have already seen in chapter [5] (see figure [ 5.21 ]) that
subsequent decay is slowed down in a system with a history of prior
field decay than in systems without any. The decay in the isolated phase
is less for accelerated cooling, but in the subsequent wind accretion
phase the field decays more rapidly in such systems than in those
starting with standard cooling. We shall see a more dramatic
manifestation of this fact in LMXBs where the duration of the isolated
phase is much longer.

#### 6.5.3 low mass binaries

Figures [ 6.19 ] to [ 6.30 ] show the evolution of the surface field in
LMXBs. In figures [ 6.19 ] and [ 6.20 ] we plot the complete evolution
of the surface field for two values of the accretion rate in the wind
phase and five values of the density at which currents are initially
concentrated, assuming standard cooling in the isolated phase. But in
these figures, the wind and Roche-contact phases are not clearly
distinguishable. Therefore we have plotted the expanded versions of
these figures to highlight the individual phases. Figures [ 6.21 ] and [
6.22 ] are for the wind-phase whereas figures [ 6.23 ] and [ 6.24 ] are
for the Roche-contact phase corresponding to those plots. In figures [
6.27 ] to [ 6.30 ] we plot the corresponding figures with an accelerated
cooling in the isolated phase.

It is seen from these figures that the surface field drops by half to
one order of magnitude in the wind phase of the binary evolution. When
the system is in contact through Roche-lobe overflow the field decay
depends very much on the rate of accretion. A difference in the
accretion rate in this phase shows up as a difference in the final value
of the surface field, which freezes at a higher value for higher rates
of accretion. The total decay in the Roche-contact phase may be as large
as two to three orders of magnitude with respect to the magnitude of the
field at the end of the wind phase.

We have mentioned before that the phase of wind accretion may not be
realized in some of the cases at all. In figures [ 6.31 ] to [ 6.34 ] we
have plotted the evolution of the surface field for such cases, both for
the standard and the accelerated cooling. We find that the final field
strengths achieved without a phase of wind accretion is not very
different from the cases where such a phase does exist. This again is
indicative of the fact that a prior phase of field decay slows down the
decay in the subsequent phase. And therefore the final result from both
the cases become similar.

There are several interesting points to note here. Figures [ 6.23 ], [
6.24 ],[ 6.29 ], and [ 6.30 ] shows that for higher values of accretion
rate in the Roche-contact phase the final field values are higher. We
have not explored the case of accretion with an Eddington rate in this
phase. From the trends observed in our calculation it is evident that
with such high rate of accretion the final field value may remain fairly
large. Under such circumstances it will be possible to have ‘recycled’
pulsars of high surface magnetic field (and therefore long spin-period)
from low mass binaries and pulsars like PSR 0820+02 will fit in with the
general scenario quite well. Then, of course, we do find significant
amount of field decay with lower rates of accretion in the Roche-contact
phase. Such low surface fields combined with the provision of maximal
spin-up would then produce millisecond pulsars.

Figures [ 6.6 ] to [ 6.30 ] then indicate that the model of field
evolution assuming an initial crustal field configuration is quite
consistent with the present scenario of field evolution. The LMXBs will
produce high-field, long-period pulsars in addition to the expected crop
of millisecond pulsars. Whereas the only kind of recycled pulsars that
are expected from the HMXBs would be of the relatively high-field,
long-period variety.

In the course of our investigations in this chapter we have seen that
there is a positive correlation between the rate of accretion with that
of the final field strength, namely, the higher the rate of accretion
the higher is the final field. There has already been a mention of such
a correlation in connection with the Z and Atoll sources [ Hasinger &
van der KlisHasinger & van der Klis1989 ] . It was suggested that the
difference between these two classes of sources in regard to their
fluctuation spectra is not only due to a difference in the accretion
rate but also due to a difference in the magnetic field. And there has
been indication from the study of the radiation spectra of these sources
that the accretion rate and the magnetic field strength are positively
correlated. Recently, \citeN lamb98 on the basis of LMXB spectra and
\citeN whit97 on the basis of the properties of the kilohertz QPOs have
indicated the existence of such a correlation. Consider figure [ 6.35 ]
- the top and the middle panels are taken from \citeN bitz95 and the
bottom panel is made using the data from \citeN verb95. The middle panel
shows the variation of the magnetic field with the orbital period for
some of the low mass binary pulsars whereas the bottom panel shows the
rate of mass accretion with the orbital period in low-mass X-ray binary
systems. For longer periods the surface field increases with period. In
the bottom panel the rate of accretion shows a similar increase with the
orbital period. Therefore we see that for longer orbital periods higher
rates of accretion and higher values of surface field are positively
correlated. This is another observational indication that for higher
rates of accretion the magnetic field strengths tend to be higher.

### 6.6 conclusions

In this chapter, we have looked at one of the model of magnetic field
evolution assuming an initial crustal field configuration to check the
consistency with the overall scenario of field evolution for isolated as
well as binary pulsars. We find that the model can explain almost all
the features that have been observed to date. And our conclusions can be
summarized as follows :

-   for this model to be consistent with the statistical analyses
    performed on the isolated pulsars at the most a maximum value of
    0.05 for the impurity strength can be allowed;

-   HMXBs produce high-field long period pulsars provided the duration
    of the wind accretion phase is short or the initial current
    distribution is located at higher densities;

-   Relatively low-field ( @xmath Gauss) objects near death-line
    (low-luminosity pulsars) are also predicted from HMXBs;

-   LMXBs will produce both high-field long period pulsars as well as
    low-field short period pulsars inclusive of millisecond pulsars in
    the later variety; and

-   a positive correlation between the rate of accretion and the final
    field strength is indicated that is supported by observational
    evidence.

## Chapter 7 spin-down induced flux expulsion and its consequences

### 7.1 introduction

Almost all models of field evolution depend on the mechanism of ohmic
decay of the underlying current loops for a permanent decrease in the
field strength. It has been mentioned earlier (chapters [ 3 ] and [ 5 ])
that such ohmic dissipation is possible only if the current loops are
situated in the crust where the electrical conductivity is finite. Any
flux that may reside in the superconducting core of the star would
remain unchanged forever unless this flux is brought out to the crust.

Models that assume an initial core-field configuration, therefore,
require a phase of flux expulsion from the core. This expelled flux then
undergoes ohmic dissipation in the crust decreasing the surface field
strength. One such model uses the spin-evolution to achieve this - that
of the ‘spin-down induced flux expulsion’ [ SrinivasanSrinivasan1989 ,
Srinivasan et al.Srinivasan et al.1990 ] . The core of the neutron star
is believed to contain two superfluids - the neutral neutron superfluid
and the charged proton superconductor. Whereas the rotation of the star
is supported by creation of vortices in the neutron superfluid, the
magnetic flux is sustained by Abrikosov fluxoids in the proton
superconductor [ Bhattacharya & SrinivasanBhattacharya & Srinivasan1995
] . Spinning down of the star requires a decrease in the number of
vortices in the superfluid core. Therefore as a result of spin-down the
vortices move out towards the core-crust boundary of the star. An
inter-pinning between the vortices and the magnetic fluxoids make the
fluxoids move outwards too, reducing their number in the core. A
decrease in the number of fluxoids in the core reduces the field
strength there. The nature of such flux expulsion as a result of
spin-evolution has been investigated in detail for both isolated pulsars
(undergoing pure dipole spin-down) and for the neutron stars that are
members of binaries (undergoing major spin-down in the ‘propeller
phase’) [ Ding, Cheng, & ChauDing et al.1993 , Jahan Miri &
BhattacharyaJahan Miri & Bhattacharya1994 , Jahan MiriJahan Miri1996 ] .

In this chapter we look at the ohmic decay of such expelled field in the
crust of an isolated as well as that of an accreting neutron star. Some
of the earlier investigations in this direction assumed an uniform ohmic
decay time-scale in the crust irrespective of the accretion rate [ Jahan
Miri & BhattacharyaJahan Miri & Bhattacharya1994 , Jahan MiriJahan
Miri1996 ] . The only detailed work in this context has been by \citeN
bhat96 where they incorporated the crustal micro-physics into their
calculation for the evolution of the expelled field. However this work
did not include the material movement that takes place in the crust as a
result of accretion. In the present work we incorporate the material
movement too and look at the evolution of an expelled field in the crust
of an accreting neutron star using the methodology developed in chapter
[ 5 ].

In the previous chapter we have discussed the overall scenario for the
evolution of the neutron star magnetic field - encompassing both
isolated neutron stars and those that are members of binary systems. In
this chapter we investigate the consequences of the model of ‘spin-down
induced flux expulsion’ in the above mentioned systems. We try to judge
whether this model, too, is consistent with the overall field scenario
and under what conditions. In section [ 7.2 ] we shall discuss the
results of our computations and conclude in section [ 7.3 ].

### 7.2 results and discussions

Using the methodology developed in chapter [ 5 ] we solve the equation [
5.16 ] for an initial flux just expelled at the core-crust boundary due
to spin-down. Such an expelled flux is deposited at the bottom of the
crust and we start our calculation with such a field configuration.
Figure [ 7.1 ] shows the distribution of the @xmath -function and figure
[ 7.2 ] the toroidal currents, @xmath , assumed at the starting point of
our evolution.

#### 7.2.1 ohmic decay in isolated pulsars

The cause of flux expulsion is the spinning down of the pulsar.
Therefore, for isolated pulsars too, experiencing a pure dipole
slow-down, there would be some flux expulsion. The extent of such flux
expulsion has been worked out by \citeN miri96 and it has been shown
there that the flux expulsion is most effective for pulsars with large
values of magnetic field strength. Before discussing the field evolution
in neutron stars in binary systems, we first look at the ohmic decay of
such an expelled field in isolated pulsars. We consider the isolated
neutron star to undergo standard cooling, in order to find the maximum
extent of field reduction in this case. But by the time significant
flux-expulsion is achieved, the crustal temperature goes down to very
low values for an isolated neutron star. In such a situation the
conductivity would be mainly determined by the scattering of the
conduction electrons by the impurities. To see the effect of that we
have considered here several values of impurity strength @xmath (see
section [ 2.4 ] for details).

In figures [ 7.3 ] and [ 7.4 ] we have plotted the time evolution of the
@xmath -profile for two values of the impurity strength. In figure [ 7.5
] the corresponding evolution of the surface fields for five values of
the impurity strength are plotted. It is seen very clearly that the
surface field actually increases when the expelled flux diffuses
outwards before finally decaying down to smaller values. It is to be
noted that even for a very large value of the impurity strength ( @xmath
= 0.4) the surface field shows significant decay only over a time-scale
of @xmath years. The active lifetime of an isolated radio pulsar is
@xmath years. Therefore, an isolated radio pulsar would experience
little field decay over its active lifetime, consistent with the
indications from statistical analyses. So we conclude that with an
expelled flux there is provision for large values of @xmath to exist in
the crust of the neutron star. In fact, we shall see later that in this
model large @xmath is a necessary requirement for millisecond pulsar
generation.

#### 7.2.2 field evolution with accretion

Before looking into the nature of field evolution in various binary
systems, we first investigate the evolution of the surface field under
accretion, assuming the @xmath -profile plotted in figure [ 7.1 ] as the
initial condition. In figure [ 7.6 ] we plot the evolution of the
surface field for different values of the accretion rate and in figure [
7.7 ] we plot the evolution for different values of the impurity
strength. We find that the field strengths go down by about only one and
a half order of magnitude even for a fairly large value of the impurity
strength. Therefore, even higher values of impurity strength will be
required for a larger reduction in the field strength. We shall see
later that for certain cases the required impurity strength is much
larger than that considered by us here (we have considered a maximum
@xmath value of 0.4) to achieve millisecond pulsar field values. The
characteristic features of field evolution are then as follows.

1.  An initial rapid decay (neglecting the early increase) is followed
    by a slow down and an eventual freezing .

2.  The onset of ‘freezing’ is faster with higher rates of accretion,
    i.e., at higher values of crustal temperature.

3.  Lower final ‘frozen’ fields are achieved for lower rates of
    accretion.

4.  To achieve a significant reduction in the field strength, very large
    values of the impurity strength are required.

It is clear from these features that the general nature of field
evolution in the case of an expelled flux is qualitatively similar to
that in the case of an initial crustal flux. This indicates that the
behaviour of the field evolution in different kinds of binaries will
again be similar to what we have found in the case of an initial crustal
flux, discussed in chapter [6].

#### 7.2.3 field evolution in binaries

In section [ 6.3 ] we have outlined the three phase of binary evolution,
namely - the isolated, the wind and the Roche-contact phase. In the wind
phase there are two distinct possibilities of interaction between the
neutron star and its main sequence companion. If the system is in the
‘propeller phase’ then there is no mass accretion. But the importance of
this phase is that the star rapidly slows down to very long periods and
as a result a significant flux-expulsion is achieved. From the point of
view of flux expulsion, therefore, we assume the flux to be completely
contained within the superconducting core (neglecting the small
flux-expulsion caused by the dipole spin-down in the isolated phase)
prior to this phase. Therefore, the ohmic decay of this flux will take
place only after this phase is over - that is in the phase of
wind-accretion and most-importantly in the phase of Roche-contact. It
has already been noted that, in case of low mass X-ray binaries, it is
not very clear as to how long the phase of wind-accretion lasts or
whether such a phase is at all realized after the ‘propeller phase’ is
over. Therefore, in our calculations we have considered cases with and
without a phase of wind accretion, as before.

##### 7.2.3.1 high mass binaries

Figures [ 7.8 ] and [ 7.9 ] show the evolution of the surface field in
high mass X-ray binaries for different values of the impurity strength
in the crust. The parameters for the high mass X-ray binary evolution
are as before. The surface field shows a clear initial increase followed
by a sharp decay. The decay in the Roche-contact phase is very small and
is almost invisible in the above-mentioned plots. In figure [ 7.10 ] we
have expanded the Roche-phase corresponding to the figure [ 7.8 ] to
highlight this phase. For the impurity strengths considered by us, the
field decreases by about an order of magnitude.

##### 7.2.3.2 low mass binaries

Figures [ 7.11 ] and [ 7.12 ] show the evolution of the surface field in
the low mass X-ray binaries; for different values of the impurity
concentration in the crust. The two figures correspond to two different
values of accretion rate in the wind phase. It should be noted that this
difference in the wind accretion rate does not manifest itself in either
the nature of the field evolution or the final field strengths. However,
a difference in the accretion rate in the Roche-contact phase shows up
very clearly in figures [ 7.13 ] and [ 7.14 ] where the Roche-contact
phases, corresponding to the figures [ 7.11 ] and [ 7.12 ], have been
expanded. Comparing the different curves (for different values of the
impurity parameter) we see that a large value of impurity strength gives
rise to a rapid decay and therefore a low value of the final surface
field.

In figure [ 7.15 ] we have plotted the evolution of the surface field
assuming the wind accretion phase to be absent. Once again we find that
for higher rates of accretion higher final field values are obtained. It
should be noted here that the final field values obtained now are only
about an order and a half of magnitude lower than the original surface
field strengths. Even though the impurity strengths assumed now are much
higher than those assumed when we investigated the field evolution in
low mass X-ray binaries with a phase of wind-accretion. In absence of a
prior phase of wind accretion the flux does not have enough time to
diffuse out to low density regions when the Roche-contact is
established. Therefore here the role of accretion, in the Roche-contact
phase, is mainly to push the currents in rather than to enhance ohmic
decay rate. Evidently, much larger impurity strength is required to be
assumed in order that the final field values could be reduced by three
to four orders of magnitude. Unfortunately, due to numerical
instabilities it becomes very difficult to explore situations with even
higher values of @xmath . But the above-mentioned figure clearly
establishes a trend as to how the final field values behave with @xmath
and it is evident that we need @xmath values much larger than those
considered here to get down to millisecond pulsar field strengths.

The most important point to note here is the fact that again, similar to
an initial crustal field configuration, the amount of field decay is
much larger than that achieved in the case of high mass X-ray binaries.
Although, in low mass X-ray binaries with higher values of impurity
strength the surface field does go down by three to four orders of
magnitude from its original value, the final field strength could remain
fairly large if the impurity strength is small. But if the
wind-accretion phase is absent in these systems then to achieve large
amount of reduction in the field strengths much larger value of the
impurity strength will be required. Therefore, the ‘spin-down induced
flux expulsion model’ will be consistent with the overall scenario of
field evolution and in particular millisecond pulsars can be produced in
low mass X-ray binaries provided the impurity strength in the crust of
the neutron stars is assumed to be extremely large.

### 7.3 conclusions

In this chapter we have investigated the consequences of ‘spin-down
induced flux expulsion’. So far, the general nature of field evolution
seem to fit the overall scenario. The nature of field evolution is quite
similar to that in case of a purely crustal model of field evolution
though the details differ. Most significantly, this model has the
requirement of large values of the impurity strength @xmath in direct
contrast to the crustal model. To summarize then :

-   The field in isolated neutron stars do not undergo any significant
    decay, over the active lifetime of the pulsar, conforming with the
    statistical analyses.

-   The field values in the high mass X-ray binaries can reaming fairly
    large for a moderate range of impurity strength.

-   A reduction of three to four orders of magnitude in the field
    strength can be achieved in the low mass X-ray binaries provided the
    impurity strength is as large as 0.5.

-   If the wind accretion phase is absent then to achieve millisecond
    pulsar field values, impurity strength in excess of unity is
    required.

## Chapter 8 conclusions

In this final chapter we shall summarize the main conclusions of our
investigations. For our work we have drawn upon many results which are
not entirely free of uncertainties. We shall also mention here such
uncertainties that are likely to affect our results. And lastly we shall
indicate the future directions of work in this context.

1.   Generic Features of Field Evolution in the Crust – In this thesis
    we have mainly investigated two models of field evolution that of an
    initial crustal current supporting the field and the model of
    spin-down induced flux expulsion. The qualitative features of field
    evolution are same for both the models. We have also looked at the
    effect of diamagnetic screening in an accreting neutron star. The
    nature of this screening is such that an assumption regarding a
    particular model of field configuration is unnecessary and the
    results of this investigation are model-independent. Therefore, we
    have the following general conclusions regarding the nature of field
    evolution in the crust.

    -   Pure Ohmic Decay in Isolated Neutron Stars :

        1.  A slow cooling of the star gives rise to a fast decay and
            consequent low final field. The opposite happens in case of
            an accelerated cooling.

        2.  An initial crustal current distribution concentrated at
            lower densities again gives rise to faster decay and low
            final surface field. Whereas if the current is located at
            higher densities the decay is slow resulting in a higher
            final surface field.

        3.  A large value of impurity strength implies a rapid decay and
            low final field. If the crust behaves more like a pure
            crystal the decay slows down considerably.

    -   Accretion-Induced Field Decay in Accreting Neutron Stars :

        1.  In an accreting neutron star the field undergoes an initial
            rapid decay, followed by slow down and an eventual freezing
            .

        2.  A positive correlation between the rate of accretion and the
            final field strength is observed, giving rise to higher
            final saturation field strengths for higher rates of
            accretion.

        3.  An expected screening of the surface field by the
            diamagnetic accreting material is rendered ineffective by
            the interchange instabilities in the liquid surface layers
            of the star.

2.   Nature of Field and Spin Evolution in Real Systems – In the next
    phase of our investigation we have applied the models of field
    evolution to real systems - isolated neutron stars as well as to
    those in binaries. The paradigm of field evolution that have emerged
    out of various observations, statistical analyses and theoretical
    expectations have been summarized in the following flow-diagram. The
    arrows indicate the expected evolutionary link between X-ray
    binaries and binary radio pulsars. The following table summarizes
    the results of our investigations.

                                                                      millisecond pulsars
      ------------------------------------- ------------------------- ------------------------------------

    It is evident that the results obtained from the field evolution
    models agree well with the observational paradigm. The nature of
    field evolution is similar for the model of spin-down induced flux
    expulsion. Though there is one major difference. To produce
    millisecond pulsars in LMXBs in spin-down induced flux expulsion
    model very large values of impurities are required. This makes the
    surface field go down to very low values in @xmath years in isolated
    pulsars in contrast to a purely crustal model.

3.   Ranges of Physical Parameters – In the following table we summarize
    the constraints on various physical parameters in the field
    evolution models placed by the requirement to match observed
    properties in a variety of systems. The parameters discussed here
    are - the density at which the initial crustal current distribution
    is located ( @xmath ), the impurity strength in the crust ( @xmath
    ), the duration of wind-accretion phase in different binary systems
    and the rate of accretion in the Roche-contact phase for LMXBs.

4.   Uncertainties – The results and conclusions stated above suffer
    from a number of uncertainties regarding the micro-physics of the
    neutron star, as listed below.

    -   Thermal Behaviour -

        1.  Isolated Phase - The present date can be made to fit
            scenarios with both a slow or an accelerated cooling. Hence
            it is not clear which is the correct cooling behaviour of an
            isolated neutron star.

        2.  Accreting Phase - the crustal temperature corresponding to a
            given rate of accretion has not been determined with any
            certainty. Also, the existing results are limited in their
            scope and there is no agreement between various authors.

        3.  Post-Accretion Phase - No calculation exists for the thermal
            behaviour of this phase at all.

    -   Transport Properties - There are several factors, the effects of
        which have not been incorporated yet, namely those of

        1.  the change in the chemical composition due to a) accretion
            and b) spin-down; and

        2.  the dislocations, defects etc. of the crustal lattice.

    -   Equation of State - Apart from the uncertainties already
        existent for a cold equation of state, the change in the
        chemical composition due to accretion introduces change in the
        equation of state and hence in a) the structure of the star and
        its b) transport properties.

    -   All of our investigation has been based on an assumption of a
        pure dipolar model for the magnetic field. The validity of these
        results requires to be checked by including higher order
        multi-poles for the field.

5.   Future Directions – One of the most important questions in the
    context of the evolution of magnetic fields in neutron stars is
    regarding the models of field generation (and therefore of the
    internal field configuration). There is no consensus as to which one
    is actually realized. Our calculations clearly point out that the
    models have very different requirements for the impurity strength in
    the crust. Possible ways of resolving this dilemma then could be the
    following.

    -   Theoretical - A better many-body calculations may determine the
        state of matter in the crust accurately in regard to its
        impurity content.

    -   Observational Prediction - An old solitary radio pulsar will
        have a very low field if the impurity content of the crust is
        very large. The detection of such a pulsar accreting matter from
        the interstellar matter will therefore immediately indicate the
        impurity content of the crust. The results of our investigation
        clearly indicate that the both the models place very stringent
        limits on the impurity strength and the limits from the
        different models are quite incompatible. Therefore such an
        observation will immediately determine the viability of one
        model or the other - predictably providing an answer to this
        question.
