## Preface of the arXiv version

This is my Master’s thesis from 2017. I have fixed a critical typo in
the definition of @xmath . Section 5 is now a published paper [ 21 ] .

My research on the tangle compactification and infinite-order tangles
continues. In [ 20 ] , Pitz and I have shown that the tangle
compactification is deeply linked to the Stone-Čech compactification,
answering a question of Diestel. And critical vertex sets, the key
concept that drives Section 5 and [ 21 ] , will be employed in two
upcoming papers.

### 1 Introduction

Many theorems about finite graphs involving paths, cycles or spanning
trees do not generalise to infinite graphs verbatim. However, if we
consider only infinite graphs which are locally finite, ¹ ¹ 1 A graph is
locally finite if each of its vertices has only finitely many
neighbours. then an elegant solution is known for generalising most of
these theorems. To understand this solution, it is important to know
that for connected locally finite graphs @xmath adding their ends ² ² 2
An end of a graph is an equivalence class of rays, where a ray simply is
a 1-way infinite path and two rays are equivalent whenever no finite set
of vertices separates them in the graph. yields a natural
compactification @xmath , their Freudenthal compactification [ 12 , 13 ]
.

Formally, to obtain @xmath we extend the 1-complex of @xmath (also
denoted @xmath ) to a topological space @xmath (where @xmath is the set
of ends of @xmath ) by declaring as open, for every finite set @xmath of
vertices and each component @xmath of @xmath the set @xmath , and taking
the topology on @xmath this generates. Here, @xmath is the union of the
1-complex of @xmath , the set of all inner edge points of edges between
@xmath and the component @xmath , and the set of all ends of @xmath all
whose rays have tails in @xmath . ³ ³ 3 For the experts: Here, we
introduced @xmath using a basis that slightly differs from the usual
one, but which generates the same topology. With our basis it will be
easier to see the similarities to the basis of the tangle
compactification.

Now, we explain the elegant solution: replacing, in the wording of the
theorems, paths with homeomorphic images of the unit interval ( arcs for
short) in the Freudenthal compactification @xmath , cycles with
homeomorphic images of the unit circle ( circles for short) in @xmath ,
and spanning trees with uniquely arc-connected subspaces of @xmath
including the vertex set of the graph ( topological spanning trees for
short, see [ 13 ] for a precise definition), does suffice to extend
these theorems. The arcs, circles and topological spanning trees
considered are allowed to contain ends of @xmath (and in a moment we
will see that sometimes they have to).

For a nice illustration of how this solution works, consider the
so-called ‘tree-packing’ [ 13 , Theorem 2.4.1] , proved independently by
Nash-Williams and Tutte in 1961: A finite multigraph contains @xmath
edge-disjoint spanning trees if and only if for every partition @xmath
of its vertex set it has at least @xmath cross-edges. Aharoni and
Thomassen [ 1 ] constructed, for every @xmath , a locally finite graph
@xmath witnessing that the naive extension of tree-packing to locally
finite graphs fails in that the graph @xmath has enough edges across
every finite partition of its vertex set but no @xmath edge-disjoint
spanning trees (see [ 13 ] for details). However, as Diestel [ 10 ] has
shown in 2005, as soon as we replace ‘spanning trees’ with ‘topological
spanning trees’ we do obtain a correct extension (also see [ 13 ,
Theorem 8.5.7] ): A locally finite multigraph contains @xmath
edge-disjoint topological spanning trees if and only if for every finite
partition @xmath of its vertex set it has at least @xmath cross-edges.
In particular, at least one of any @xmath edge-disjoint topological
spanning trees of @xmath must use an end.

Another example is a theorem by Fleischner [ 13 , Theorem 10.3.1] from
1974: If @xmath is a finite 2-connected graph, then @xmath has a
Hamilton cycle. ⁴ ⁴ 4 For every graph @xmath and each natural number
@xmath we write @xmath for the graph on @xmath in which two vertices are
adjacent if and only if they have distance at most @xmath in @xmath .
This theorem was extended by Georgakopoulos [ 17 ] in 2009: If @xmath is
a locally finite 2-connected graph, then @xmath has a Hamilton circle.

More generally, Diestel and Kühn [ 6 , 7 ] (2004) and Berger and Bruhn [
2 ] (2009) were able to generalise the full cycle space theory of finite
graphs to locally finite ones. We refer the reader to [ 13 , Theorem
8.5.10] for details since these go beyond the scope of this
introduction.

But graphs that are not locally finite—in general—cannot be compactified
by adding their ends, so the elegant solution no longer applies. For
example, in the introduction of Chapter 6 we will see that a @xmath (a
complete bipartite graph with one countable bipartition class and the
other of size 2) has enough edges across every finite partition of its
vertex set for @xmath . But this graph has no ends, so the naive
extension of topological spanning trees defaults to spanning trees, any
two of which must share an edge (otherwise, none would be connected).
Thus, it is considered one of the most important problems in infinite
graph theory to come up with an extension that allows us to extend the
cycle space theory to non-locally finite graphs. Recently, in 2015,
Diestel [ 14 ] proposed a possible solution to this problem and
constructed a new compactification which uses tangles instead of ends,
the tangle compactification . Before we present the special
characteristics of this compactification, we give a brief introduction
to tangles.

A separation of finite order of a graph @xmath is a set @xmath with
@xmath finite and @xmath such that @xmath has no edge between @xmath and
@xmath . If @xmath is an end of a graph @xmath , then it orients each
separation @xmath of finite order towards a big side @xmath in that
every ray contained in @xmath has some tail in @xmath (clearly, it
cannot both have a tail in @xmath and a tail in @xmath since @xmath is a
finite separator). Observe that every end of a graph @xmath orients all
the finite order separations consistently in that e.g. for every two
finite order separations @xmath and @xmath with @xmath and @xmath the
end does not choose @xmath and @xmath as big sides. From a more abstract
point of view (but for a different purpose), Robertson and Seymour [ 25
] defined an @xmath - tangle (or tangle ) in a graph as an orientation
of all its finite order separations towards a big side that is
consistent in some sense including the above. Every end induces an
@xmath -tangle, so each graph’s end space can be considered as a natural
subset of its tangle space, and in fact, if a graph is locally finite
and connected, then its @xmath -tangles turn out to be precisely its
ends (and its tangle compactification coincides with its Freudenthal
compactification). However, for graphs that are not locally finite,
there may be @xmath -tangles that are not induced by an end, and adding
these on top of the ends suffices to compactify those graphs—whereas
adding only the ends does not.

Understanding the tangles that are not induced by an end is important,
but for this, we need some notation first: If @xmath is a graph, then we
write @xmath for its tangle compactification, and we denote by @xmath
the collection of all finite sets of vertices of this graph, partially
ordered by inclusion. Furthermore, for every @xmath we write @xmath for
the collection of all components of @xmath . Finally, for every
subcollection @xmath we denote the vertex set of @xmath by @xmath . Now
we may start: Every finite order separation @xmath corresponds to the
bipartition @xmath of @xmath with @xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and this correspondence is bijective for fixed @xmath . Hence if @xmath
is an @xmath -tangle of the graph, then for each @xmath it also chooses
one big side from each bipartition @xmath of @xmath , namely the @xmath
with @xmath where @xmath is the big side of the corresponding finite
order separation @xmath . Since it chooses these sides consistently, for
each @xmath they form an ultrafilter on @xmath . Furthermore, these
ultrafilters are compatible in that they are limits of a natural inverse
system @xmath . Here, each @xmath is the Stone-Čech Hausdorff
compactification of @xmath (where @xmath is endowed with the discrete
topology), i.e each @xmath is the set of all ultrafilters on @xmath ,
equipped with a natural topology. The bonding maps @xmath are the unique
continuous maps extending the maps @xmath which send, for all @xmath ,
every component of @xmath to the unique component of @xmath including
it. Strikingly, it turns out that the @xmath -tangles are precisely the
limits of this inverse system, and the ends of a graph are precisely
those of its @xmath -tangles which induce for each @xmath a principal
ultrafilter on @xmath . In particular, if a graph @xmath is locally
finite and connected, then all @xmath are finite, and hence all
ultrafilters on them are principal. So by the above correspondence, we
see that every @xmath -tangle of @xmath is induced by an end, and so the
tangle compactification coincides with the Freudenthal compactification
for connected locally finite graphs.

This inverse limit description of the @xmath -tangles is the key to a
better understanding of the tangles that are not induced by ends: every
@xmath -tangle which is not induced by an end does induce a
non-principal ultrafilter on some @xmath , and, as shown by Diestel,
each of these non-principal ultrafilters alone determines that tangle.
Therefore, we call these tangles ultrafilter tangles . It turns out
that, for every ultrafilter tangle @xmath there exists a unique element
@xmath of @xmath whose up-closure in @xmath consists precisely of those
@xmath for which the tangle @xmath induces a non-principal ultrafilter
on @xmath .

We conclude our general introduction with a brief description of the
tangle compactification. More details will be given in Section 2.3 . To
obtain the tangle compactification @xmath of a graph @xmath we extend
the 1-complex of @xmath to a topological space @xmath (where @xmath
corresponds to the tangle space) by declaring as open, for every @xmath
and each subcollection @xmath , the set @xmath , and taking the topology
on @xmath this generates. Here, @xmath is the union of the 1-complex of
@xmath , the set of all inner edge points of edges between @xmath and
@xmath , and the set of all limits @xmath with @xmath . Note that @xmath
means that the @xmath -tangle corresponding to the limit @xmath orients
the finite order separation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

towards @xmath , so @xmath consists precisely of those @xmath -tangles
which orient this finite order separation towards @xmath . Clearly, all
singleton subsets of the tangle compactification are closed in it. Now
we know enough to understand the topics and results of this work. In the
remainder of this introduction let me indicate briefly what awaits the
reader later.

##### Chapter 2.

In this chapter we introduce basic notation, inverse limits and some
lemmas from general topology. Furthermore, we provide a summary of
Diestel’s original paper on the tangle compactification [ 14 ] , and we
give an overview for the various topologies used for infinite graphs in
this work.

##### Chapter 3.

In this chapter we prove some basic results about the tangle
compactification needed later, such as a version of the Jumping Arc
Lemma from [ 13 ] . Also, we find a combinatorial description of the
sets @xmath (for ultrafilter tangles @xmath ):

###### Lemma 3.3.4.

Let @xmath be any graph. The following are equivalent for all @xmath :

1.   There exists an ultrafilter tangle @xmath with @xmath .

2.   Infinitely many components of @xmath have neighbourhood equal to
    @xmath .

We call the sets @xmath satisfying (i) and (ii) of this lemma the
critical elements of @xmath . The following theorem involves these sets:

###### Theorem 3.3.5.

Let @xmath be any graph. The following are equivalent for all distinct
vertices @xmath and @xmath of the graph @xmath :

1.   There exist infinitely many independent @xmath – @xmath paths in
    @xmath .

2.   There exists an end of @xmath dominated ⁵ ⁵ 5 A vertex @xmath of a
    graph @xmath dominates an end @xmath of @xmath if no finite subset
    of @xmath separates @xmath from a ray in @xmath . by both vertices
    @xmath and @xmath or
    there exists some critical element of @xmath containing both
    vertices @xmath and @xmath .

For the next result we first need some additional definitions. An edge
end of a graph is an equivalence class of rays, where two rays are
equivalent whenever no finite set of edges separates them in the graph.
Two vertices of a graph @xmath are said to be finitely separable if
there exists some finite set @xmath of edges such that the two vertices
are contained in distinct components of @xmath . Briefly speaking, for
connected graphs @xmath , the compact Hausdorff topological space @xmath
is obtained from @xmath and its edge ends by equipping this set with a
very coarse topology ⁶ ⁶ 6 whose basic open sets can be thought of as
components of @xmath plus certain edge ends and half-open partial edges
of @xmath for each finite set @xmath of edges first, and then
identifying every two points which share the same open neighbourhoods (a
precise definition is provided in Section 2.5 ).

By generalising the notion of ‘not finitely separable’ to an equivalence
relation @xmath on @xmath (where @xmath ) we derive this space from the
tangle compactification as a natural quotient:

###### Theorem 3.4.14.

If @xmath is a connected graph, then @xmath is homeomorphic to the
quotient @xmath of the tangle compactification @xmath .

##### Chapter 4.

Since inverse limits have claimed their place in the infinite
topological graph theory as useful tools to construct limit objects such
as circles, arcs and topological spanning trees from finite minors (see
the 5th edition of [ 13 ] for an inverse limit description of the
Freudenthal compactification), it makes sense to investigate whether it
is possible to describe the tangle compactification via a similar
inverse limit. As our main result in this chapter, we show that this is
indeed possible. For this, we construct an inverse system @xmath of
topological spaces @xmath that are based on multigraphs with finite
vertex set but possibly infinite edge set. These multigraphs are
obtained from the graph @xmath by contraction of possibly disconnected
vertex sets, but we will see that this is best possible. The topological
spaces @xmath are compact and all of their singleton subsets are closed
in them. As promised, we show that the inverse limit

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

of our inverse system describes the tangle compactification:

###### Theorem 4.3.1.

For every graph @xmath its tangle compactification is homeomorphic to
the inverse limit @xmath .

##### Chapter 5.

Whenever we consider a compactification of a topological space, three
particular questions come to mind: Is it the coarsest compactification?
If not, how does a coarsest one look like, and why can we not just take
the one-point compactification and be done? In this chapter, we only
consider compactifications of the 1-complex of @xmath extending the end
space in a meaningful way, and we call these @xmath - compactifications
(since the end space is denoted @xmath ). First, we characterise the
graphs admitting a one-point @xmath -compactification @xmath , one with
@xmath (see Proposition 5.2.2 ), and we give an example of such a graph
showing that—in general—the one-point @xmath -compactification does not
reflect the structure of the graph at all. However, there exist simple
examples admitting a one-point @xmath -compactification reflecting their
structure while their tangle compactification adds at least @xmath many
points on top of the ends. Hence Diestel [ 14 ] asked:

1.  For which graphs is their tangle compactification also their
    coarsest
    @xmath -compactification?

2.  If it is not, is there a unique such @xmath -compactification, and
    is there a canonical way to obtain it from the tangle
    compactification?

To answer these questions, we first construct an inverse system @xmath
of Hausdorff compactifications @xmath of the @xmath (where each @xmath
is equipped with the discrete topology) whose inverse limit @xmath we
use to obtain an @xmath -compactification @xmath of the graph @xmath in
the way Diestel used @xmath to compactify it. Here, for each @xmath the
Hausdorff compactification @xmath of @xmath adds as many points to
@xmath as @xmath includes critical elements of @xmath . We will see that
@xmath includes the end space as a natural subspace since the bonding
maps @xmath respect the natural maps @xmath (recall that @xmath sends
every component of @xmath to the unique component of @xmath including
it), and:

###### Proposition 5.3.8.

There exists a natural bijection between @xmath and the collection of
all critical elements of @xmath .

Since one-point @xmath -compactifications in general do not reflect the
structure of the original graph in a meaningful way, we wish to impose
further conditions on the @xmath -compactifications considered in (ii).
For this, we introduce @xmath -systems: these are inverse systems of
Hausdorff compactifications of the @xmath whose inverse limits
generalise the directions ⁷ ⁷ 7 A map @xmath with domain @xmath is a
direction of @xmath if @xmath maps every @xmath to a component of @xmath
and @xmath whenever @xmath (this condition says that @xmath chooses the
components consistently). Diestel and Kühn [ 5 ] have shown that the
directions of a graph are precisely its ends. of the graph @xmath , and
hence its ends. Both @xmath and @xmath come from @xmath -systems, and:

###### Theorem 5.4.1.

Every @xmath -system induces an @xmath -compactification of its graph
@xmath . In particular, @xmath and @xmath are @xmath -compactifications
of the graph @xmath .

Moreover, we obtain the following analogue of [ 14 , Theorem 1] for
@xmath :

###### Theorem 5.4.2.

Let @xmath be any graph.

1.  @xmath is a compact space in which @xmath is dense and @xmath is
    totally disconnected.

2.   If @xmath is locally finite and connected, then @xmath and @xmath
    coincides with the Freudenthal compactification of @xmath .

Studying the technical @xmath -systems leads us to the following result
comparing our new compactification @xmath and the tangle
compactification @xmath :

###### Theorem 5.4.7.

For every graph @xmath its @xmath -compactification @xmath is coarser
than its tangle compactification @xmath .

Then we are finally in a position to answer the first question and half
of the second question of Diestel from above:

###### Theorem 5.4.10 and 5.4.11.

Let @xmath be any graph. @xmath is the coarsest @xmath -compactification
of the graph @xmath induced by a @xmath -system while @xmath is the
finest one. Furthermore, the following are equivalent:

1.   There exists a homeomorphism between @xmath and @xmath fixing
    @xmath .

2.   Every @xmath is finite.

3.  @xmath .

As our third main result of this chapter, we answer the second half of
Diestel’s second question from above, and show that there is a canonical
way to obtain @xmath from the tangle compactification. For this, we
define the natural equivalence relation @xmath on the collection of all
ultrafilter tangles by letting @xmath whenever @xmath holds.

###### Theorem 5.5.11.

For every graph @xmath the @xmath -compactification @xmath is
homeomorphic to the quotient @xmath of the tangle compactification
@xmath .

If @xmath denotes the set of all ultrafilter tangles of a graph @xmath ,
then we find the following cardinality bound and comparison:

###### Proposition 5.5.15.

For every graph @xmath the following hold:

1.  @xmath ,

2.  @xmath .

Strikingly, we will see an explicit definition of a set @xmath of finite
order separations yielding our fourth main result in this chapter:

###### Theorem 5.6.4.

For every graph @xmath the elements of the inverse limit @xmath are
precisely the @xmath -tangles of the graph @xmath with respect to the
set @xmath .

In particular, @xmath actually is another ‘tangle compactification’ for
a smaller separation system. Finally, we find an inverse subsystem of
the inverse system @xmath whose inverse limit @xmath describes the
@xmath -compactification @xmath :

###### Theorem 5.7.5.

For every graph @xmath the inverse limit @xmath is homeomorphic to the
@xmath -compactification @xmath .

##### Chapter 6.

Earlier, I expressed my hopes for the tangle compactification to
generalise the elegant solution from the locally finite case to the
general case. To explain why I think that modifications to the tangle
compactification cannot be avoided, I show that every possible notion of
a topological spanning tree I could think of does not meet my
expectations. More precisely, for the case that our graph @xmath is a
@xmath (see Fig. 1 ) I will a name set of edges which I expect to induce
a topological spanning tree for any sensible notion of a topological
spanning tree, but none of whose candidates are topologically connected.

The heavy edge set from the drawing of our graph @xmath in Fig. 1 is the
thin sum ⁸ ⁸ 8 A family @xmath of subsets of @xmath is thin if no edge
lies in @xmath for infinitely many @xmath . Then the thin sum @xmath is
the collection of all edges that lie in @xmath for an odd number of
indices @xmath . See [ 13 ] for details. of all facial cycles, and I
expect it to be an element of the cycle space for any notion of a cycle
space of this graph. Similarly, I further expect every two edges at a
middle vertex together to form an element of any such cycle space.
Consequently, I think that the upper fan in Fig. 1 should induce a
topological spanning tree which contains no edge of the lower fan (since
this would create an element of the cycle space). But if we take as
@xmath the upper fan plus the lower vertex @xmath and add any subset of
the tangle space, then this turns out to be a (topologically)
disconnected subspace of the tangle compactification: Indeed, if we
cover @xmath with any basic open neighbourhood @xmath of the 1-complex
of @xmath , and if we cover @xmath with @xmath (which is open since all
singleton subsets of the tangle compactification are closed in it), then
@xmath and @xmath meet only in inner edge points of the lower fan which
are no points of @xmath . Thus @xmath induces an open bipartition of
@xmath . Informally, the problem here is that the tangles are not
‘sufficiently connected’ to certain vertices of the graph, which allows
us to separate @xmath from @xmath so easily. This is why I think that it
makes sense to consider modifications to the tangle compactification.

If we modify the tangle compactification to yield a new compactification
with the potential of overcoming this and so many other difficulties,
then it would be of great advantage if we could see to it that this new
compactification also be Hausdorff: then, for connected graphs, the
whole field of (non-metric) continuum ⁹ ⁹ 9 A continuum is a compact
connected Hausdorff topological space. See Section 2.4 for further
details. theory would open up, providing us with a useful topological
tool box. This is why I construct two new spaces: First, in this chapter
we study classic hindrances to earlier attempts, and we find inspiration
leading to the construction of the auxiliary space @xmath . This
auxiliary space is Hausdorff, but in general it is not compact. Thus in
the next section we will enhance the idea behind the auxiliary space
@xmath to obtain a Hausdorff compactification @xmath from the tangle
compactification.

The auxiliary space @xmath is obtained from @xmath (for the experts:
here, @xmath is endowed with MTop ) in two steps: First, we add
auxiliary edges (which—formally—are internally disjoint copies of the
unit interval) between every end of the graph and each of its dominating
vertices, and between any two distinct vertices @xmath and @xmath of the
same critical element of @xmath (one new auxiliary edge for each
critical element of @xmath both vertices are contained in, and
internally disjoint from the edge @xmath of @xmath in case it exists).
Second, we generalise the topology of @xmath onto this new space in a
natural way.

In the first half of this chapter, we study the arc-connected subspaces
of @xmath induced by the auxiliary edges. More precisely, we have a
closer look at the auxiliary arc-components of @xmath , where an
auxiliary arc is an arc in @xmath which is included in the closure of
the auxiliary edges. Rather strikingly, our first main result of this
chapter holds without imposing any cardinality bounds on the graph
considered:

###### Theorem 6.4.2.

Let @xmath be any graph. Then between every two distinct points @xmath
and @xmath of @xmath there exists an auxiliary arc if and only if @xmath
and @xmath are not finitely separable.

This suggests that we might be able to take advantage of the results in
Chapter 3 , namely that @xmath is the quotient @xmath of the tangle
compactification, in order to generalise statements about @xmath to
statements about the auxiliary space @xmath . We will see that every
normal spanning tree of the graph @xmath induces a topological spanning
tree (with respect to the common definition in terms of arcs) of @xmath
, so the auxiliary space @xmath overcomes one of the classic hindrances
from [ 8 ] (which will be presented in detail in the introduction of
Chapter 6 ).

Motivated by these findings, we use the synergy between @xmath and
@xmath to prove a generalised version of tree-packing ¹⁰ ¹⁰ 10 As
mentioned earlier, the so-called ‘tree-packing’ [ 13 , Theorem 2.4.1]
was proved independently by Nash-Williams and Tutte in 1961: A finite
multigraph contains @xmath edge-disjoint spanning trees if and only if
for every partition @xmath of its vertex set it has at least @xmath
cross-edges. for countable graphs:

###### Theorem 6.7.4.

Let @xmath be a countable connected graph. Then the following are
equivalent for all @xmath :

1.  @xmath has @xmath topological spanning trees in @xmath which are
    edge-disjoint on @xmath .

2.  @xmath has at least @xmath edges across any finite vertex partition
    @xmath .

In the outlook of Chapter 6 we will see an idea on a generalisation of
thin sums for circles of @xmath , but I abandoned further investigation
when the idea of @xmath came to my mind as a better candidate than
@xmath .

##### Chapter 7.

In the previous chapter we have seen that since none of the possible
notions of a topological spanning tree of the tangle compactification I
could think of met my expectations, I suggested to modify the tangle
compactification. Furthermore, I claimed that it would be of great
advantage if our modifications would yield a Hausdorff compactification,
since then—for connected graphs—the whole field of (non-metric)
continuum theory would open up, providing us with a useful topological
tool box. Then we studied the auxiliary space @xmath which—in general—is
only Hausdorff but not compact. In this chapter we enhance the idea
behind this auxiliary space to obtain a Hausdorff compactification
@xmath from the tangle compactification.

Starting from the tangle compactification, we add limit edges
(which—formally—are internally disjoint copies of the unit interval)
between every end of the graph and each vertex dominating it, and
between every ultrafilter tangle @xmath and each vertex in @xmath .
Treating the inner limit edge points almost like their incident tangles
allows us to turn the topology of the tangle compactification into a
compact Hausdorff one of the new space, yielding the Hausdorff
compactification @xmath . (As mentioned earlier, we will modify the
inverse system @xmath to construct @xmath formally, see Chapter 7 for
details.)

To be precise, the Hausdorff compactification @xmath only compactifies
the 1-complex of @xmath endowed with a slightly coarser topology: at
each vertex we only take @xmath -balls instead of stars of arbitrary
half-open partial edges (for the experts: @xmath is a Hausdorff
compactification of @xmath ). Since we wish to study graphs of arbitrary
big cardinality while the cardinality of arcs and circles is that of the
unit interval (and hence constant), this discrepancy potentially
prohibits us from fully understanding these graphs (e.g. sufficiently
big graphs would not have a Hamilton circle by definition). Hence we
suggest generalisations of arcs, circles and topological spanning trees
for the Hausdorff compactification @xmath solely in terms of continua
(see Chapter 7 for details).

When @xmath came to my mind, this work had already reached critical
length, so I only provide sketches. However, the examples I studied so
far looked really promising, and I am eager to continue my research on
this space.

##### Chapter 8.

Since the tangle compactification in general is not Hausdorff, but the
quotient @xmath is, and since this quotient is homeomorphic to @xmath
(cf. Chapter 3 ) for connected graphs @xmath , one might ask whether
@xmath is the maximal Hausdorff quotient of the tangle compactification.
Strinkingly, an already known example witnesses that—in general—this is
not the case. In this chapter we study several graphs, but I did not
succeed in finding a combinatorial description of the equivalence
relation on the tangle compactification yielding its maximal Hausdorff
quotient (it seems like wild auxiliary arcs are the key here, where an
arc is wild if it induces the ordering of the rationals on some subset
of its vertices).

However, as our main contribution we at least present sufficient
combinatorial conditions for when @xmath is the maximal Hausdorff
quotient of the tangle compactification of a connected graph @xmath .
For these results we need two new pieces of notation: First, if @xmath
is a graph and @xmath is a set, then we write @xmath for the collection
of all edges of @xmath with both endvertices in @xmath . Second, if
@xmath is a normal spanning tree of a graph @xmath , then by [ 13 ,
Lemma 8.2.3] every end @xmath of @xmath contains precisely one normal
ray of @xmath (a ray in @xmath starting at the root of @xmath ) which we
denote @xmath .

###### Proposition 8.2.2.

Let @xmath be a connected graph such that for all two distinct vertices
@xmath and @xmath of @xmath the following are equivalent:

1.   The vertices @xmath and @xmath are not finitely separable.

2.   There exists some @xmath containing both @xmath and @xmath such
    that no @xmath disjoint from @xmath separates @xmath and @xmath in
    @xmath .

Then @xmath is the maximal Hausdorff quotient of the tangle
compactification @xmath .

If (ii) holds for two distinct vertices @xmath and @xmath of a graph
@xmath , witnessed by such an @xmath , then we can inductively find
infinitely many edge-disjoint @xmath – @xmath paths in @xmath , so
@xmath and @xmath are not finitely separable. In particular, (ii)
implies (i). Therefore, all connected finitely separable graphs satisfy
the premise of this proposition. The next result involves normal
spanning trees and binary trees:

###### Proposition 8.4.2.

If @xmath is a connected graph such that for every @xmath the graph
@xmath has a normal spanning tree @xmath whose subtree @xmath contains
no subdivision of the (infinite) binary tree, then @xmath is the maximal
Hausdorff quotient of the tangle compactification @xmath .

In the outlook of this chapter we point out the difficulties preventing
us from giving a characterisation of these graphs, and we state our
desired result as a conjecture.

Personally, I hope that a (possibly modified) tangle compactification
allows us to further generalise the elegant solution from the locally
finite case to the general case, and that is why in this work I study
the tangle compactification of infinite graphs.

### 2 Definitions & general facts

#### 2.1 Basic Notation

Any terms regarding graphs that are not defined in this work can be
found in [ 13 ] .

A finite partition of a set is said to be cofinite if at most one
partition class is infinite. A set @xmath is cofinite in a set @xmath if
@xmath is finite. If @xmath is cofinite in @xmath , then @xmath is
called a cofinite subset of @xmath . If @xmath are two sets and @xmath
is an equivalence relation on @xmath we denote by @xmath the set @xmath
.

The set @xmath contains @xmath , and for every @xmath we denote by
@xmath the set @xmath . We denote the unit interval @xmath by @xmath ,
and for @xmath and @xmath we write @xmath for the open interval @xmath
and @xmath .

A handful of statements are modified or generalised versions of
statements from the lecture courses by Diestel (winter 2015–summer
2016); we flagged them with an ‘ @xmath ’.

If @xmath is a graph, then we denote by @xmath the 1-complex of @xmath ,
i.e. in @xmath every edge @xmath is a homeomorphic copy @xmath of @xmath
with @xmath corresponding to @xmath and @xmath for every other edge
@xmath of @xmath , and @xmath also inherits the euclidean metric from
@xmath . The points of @xmath are called inner edge points , and they
inherit their basic open neighbourhoods from @xmath . The space @xmath
is called a topological edge , but we refer to it simply as edge .
Furthermore, for every vertex @xmath of @xmath the set @xmath with each
@xmath some point of @xmath is basic open. If every @xmath is at
distance @xmath from @xmath with respect to the metric of @xmath , then
we write @xmath . For every @xmath we write @xmath .

If @xmath is a topological edge, and @xmath is its inherited metric from
@xmath , then we denote by @xmath the point of @xmath corresponding to
@xmath , and for all @xmath we write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for the subset of @xmath corresponding to the open interval @xmath (with
@xmath corresponding to 0 and @xmath corresponding to @xmath ).

If @xmath is a finite set of vertices of @xmath and @xmath is an end of
@xmath , then @xmath is the unique component of @xmath such that every
ray in @xmath has a tail in it. If @xmath is a component of @xmath , we
write @xmath . Furthermore, if @xmath is an end of @xmath , we write
@xmath for @xmath .

For every set @xmath we denote by @xmath the set of all edges of @xmath
with both endvertices in @xmath . If @xmath and @xmath are two disjoint
sets and @xmath , then we write @xmath for the set of all inner points
of @xmath – @xmath edges (of @xmath ) at distance less than @xmath from
their endpoint in @xmath (with respect to the metric of the edge). The
‘*’ on the right side is supposed to help us remember ‘from where to
take our @xmath -balls’.

Two vertices of @xmath are said to be finitely separable whenever there
exist some finitely many edges separating them. ¹¹ ¹¹ 11 i.e. @xmath
finite @xmath such that the two vertices are contained in distinct
components of @xmath . If every two distinct vertices of @xmath are
finitely separable, then we call @xmath finitely separable .

If @xmath is a normal spanning tree (NST) of @xmath and @xmath is an end
of @xmath , we denote by @xmath the normal ray of @xmath in @xmath (see
[ 13 , Lemma 8.2.3] ).

If @xmath is a ray and @xmath is a vertex of @xmath , then @xmath
denotes the tail of @xmath starting with @xmath , and @xmath denotes the
finite intial segment of @xmath ending with @xmath .

We denote by @xmath the (infinite) binary tree on the set of finite 0--1
sequences (with the empty sequence as the root).

#### 2.2 Inverse Limits

Below we give a minimal introduction to inverse limits of inverse
systems accumulated from [ 13 , Chapter 8.7 of the 5th edition] , [ 24 ]
and [ 16 ] :

A partially ordered set @xmath is called directed if for every @xmath
there is some @xmath with @xmath . Assume that @xmath is a family of
topological spaces indexed by some directed poset @xmath . Furthermore
suppose that we have a family @xmath of continuous maps which are
compatible in that @xmath for all @xmath , and which are the identity on
@xmath in case of @xmath . Then both families together form an inverse
system , and the maps @xmath are called its bonding maps . We denote
such a system by @xmath , or @xmath for short if @xmath is clear from
context. The inverse limit @xmath (or @xmath for short) of this system
is the subset

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

of @xmath whose product topology we pass on to @xmath via the subspace
topology. Whenever we define an inverse system without specifying a
topology for the spaces @xmath , we tacitly assume them to carry the
discrete topology. We end this introduction by listing some Lemmas which
we will put to use later:

###### Lemma 2.2.1 ([24, Lemma 1.1.2]).

If @xmath is an inverse system of Hausdorff topological spaces, then
@xmath is a closed subspace of @xmath .

A topological space is totally disconnected if every point in the space
is its own connected component.

###### Lemma 2.2.2 ([24, Proposition 1.1.3]).

Let @xmath be an inverse system of compact Hausdorff totally
disconnected topological spaces. Then @xmath is also a compact Hausdorff
totally disconnected topological space.

###### Lemma 2.2.3 ([16, Lemma 1.1.3]).

The inverse limit of an inverse system of non-empty compact Hausdorff
spaces is a non-empty compact Hausdorff space.

###### Lemma 2.2.4 (Generalized Infinity Lemma, [24, Proposition 1.1.4]
and [16, Corollary 1.1.4]).

The inverse limit of an inverse system of non-empty finite sets is
non-empty.

###### Lemma 2.2.5 ([16, Lemma 1.1.1]).

Let @xmath be an inverse system of topological spaces and denote by
@xmath the restriction of the @xmath th projection map @xmath to @xmath
where @xmath . Then the collection of all subsets of @xmath of the form
@xmath with @xmath open in @xmath is a basis for the topology of @xmath
.

Moreover, if for every @xmath the set @xmath is a basis of the topology
of @xmath , then the collection of all subsets of @xmath of the form
@xmath with @xmath in @xmath is a basis for the topology of @xmath . ¹²
¹² 12 This last sentence is not part of [ 16 , Lemma 1.1.1] , but its
claim follows immediately from the original statement.

A topological space @xmath is T @xmath if for every pair of distinct
points, each has an open neighbourhood avoiding the other. Equivalently,
@xmath is T @xmath if and only if every finite subset of @xmath is
closed. A topological space @xmath is T @xmath if it is Hausdorff. Note
that we use normal font here, whereas the binary tree @xmath uses
italic.

###### Lemma 2.2.6 ([16, Corollary 1.1.6]).

Let @xmath be a compact space, @xmath an inverse system of T @xmath
topological spaces, and @xmath a compatible system of continuous
surjective maps. Let @xmath map each @xmath to @xmath . Then @xmath is a
continuous surjection. ¹³ ¹³ 13 In [ 16 ] the @xmath are required to be
Hausdorff (T @xmath ), but T @xmath suffices since the proof only uses
that singleton subsets of the @xmath are closed. Furthermore, [ 16 ]
does not state that @xmath is continuous.

###### Proof.

Since [ 16 ] only states that @xmath is surjective, we quickly show that
it is also continuous. For this, by Lemma 2.2.5 consider any basic open
set @xmath of @xmath where @xmath is open in @xmath . Then @xmath
implies that @xmath which is open in @xmath since @xmath is continuous.
∎

###### Lemma 2.2.7 ([16, Corollary 1.1.5]).

Let @xmath and @xmath be inverse systems of compact Hausdorff spaces.
Let @xmath be a compatible system of continuous surjections. Then the
map

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

is a continuous surjection.

A subset @xmath of @xmath is cofinal in @xmath if for every @xmath there
is some @xmath with @xmath . If @xmath and @xmath are two topological
spaces, we write @xmath to say that @xmath and @xmath are homeomorphic.

###### Lemma 2.2.8 ([13, Lemma 8.7.3 of the 5th edition]).

Let @xmath be an inverse system of compact spaces, and let @xmath be
cofinal in @xmath . Then @xmath satisfies @xmath with the homeomorphism
that maps every point @xmath to its restriction @xmath .

A function @xmath is monotone if @xmath is connected for every @xmath .
Assume that @xmath is a family of topological spaces, and furthermore
suppose that for every @xmath we have a continuous map @xmath . Then the
family of the @xmath together with the family of all @xmath forms an
inverse sequence , denoted @xmath . Clearly, every such inverse sequence
gives rise to an inverse system @xmath where @xmath for @xmath and
@xmath . Hence, given an inverse sequence @xmath , we write @xmath for
the inverse limit of the inverse system it induces.

###### Theorem 2.2.9 (Capel, [4, Theorem 4.11], [19, Theorem 200]).

If @xmath is an inverse sequence such that @xmath is an arc and @xmath
is monotone and surjective for every @xmath then @xmath is an arc.

#### 2.3 ‘Ends and tangles’ plus further notation

This section not only serves as a summary of ‘Ends and tangles’ ( [ 14 ]
), but also as an introduction of its basic definitions and notation,
some of which we modified to meet our needs. At the end of this section,
we introduce some additional notation, and we remind of a useful
construction from the proof of [ 5 , Theorem 2.2] . But first, we start
with the promised summary:

A separation of a graph @xmath is a set @xmath with @xmath and @xmath
subsets of @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath has no edge from @xmath to
@xmath . Clearly, every separation @xmath induces a bipartition of the
set of components of @xmath , and vice versa. The cardinal @xmath is the
order of the separation @xmath . Every separation @xmath has two
orientations , namely the ordered pairs @xmath and @xmath , which we
also refer to as oriented separations . ¹⁴ ¹⁴ 14 Usually we refer to an
oriented separation simply as ‘separation’, relying upon context
instead. Informally, we think of @xmath and @xmath as the small side and
the big side of @xmath , respectively. The order of an oriented
separation @xmath simply is the order of @xmath , namely @xmath . If
@xmath is a set of separations of the graph, then we denote by @xmath
the collection of the orientations of its elements. We shall call @xmath
the inverse of @xmath and vice versa. For the sake of readability we use
the more intuitive ’arrow notation’ known from vector spaces: when
referring to an element of @xmath as @xmath (or @xmath ), we denote its
inverse by @xmath (or @xmath ). Then the map @xmath is an involution on
@xmath . We define a partial ordering @xmath on @xmath by letting

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Note that our involution reverses this partial ordering, i.e. for @xmath
we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The triple @xmath is known as a separation system .

An orientation @xmath of @xmath is a subset of @xmath with @xmath for
every @xmath . If no two distinct @xmath satisfy @xmath then we say that
@xmath is consistent. We say that an orientation @xmath of @xmath avoids
some @xmath if @xmath and @xmath intersect emptily. A non-empty set
@xmath is a said to be a star if @xmath holds for all distinct @xmath .
The interior of a star @xmath is the set @xmath . In the context of a
given graph @xmath , the set @xmath will be denoted by @xmath , and
@xmath will denote the set of all separations of @xmath of finite order.
Furthermore, @xmath will denote the set of all stars in @xmath . For the
rest of this chapter, we let @xmath be a fixed infinite graph. By @xmath
we denote the set of all finite stars @xmath of finite interior, and by
@xmath we denote the set of all stars @xmath of finite interior. Outside
this section, @xmath will be used to denote topological spanning trees.

For every @xmath we say that an @xmath - tangle of @xmath is a
consistent orientation of @xmath avoiding @xmath . Moreover, an @xmath -
tangle of @xmath is said to be a @xmath -tangle of @xmath , and we write
@xmath for the collection of all @xmath -tangles of @xmath . ¹⁵ ¹⁵ 15 As
Diestel showed in [ 14 ] , this definition is equivalent to the
definition known from Robertson & Seymour. If @xmath is an end of @xmath
, then by [ 14 , Corollary 1.7] letting

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

defines a bijection @xmath from the ends of @xmath to the @xmath
-tangles of @xmath . Therefore, we call these @xmath -tangles the end
tangles of @xmath . By abuse of notation, we will write @xmath for the
collection of all end tangles of @xmath . The elements of @xmath we call
the ultrafilter tangles of @xmath , and we write @xmath for the
collection of all these. ¹⁶ ¹⁶ 16 This definition differs from the one
given by Diestel, but both turn out to be equivalent due to [ 14 ,
Theorem 2] . In particular, we have @xmath .

For every @xmath we denote by @xmath be the set of all components of
@xmath , and @xmath is the set of all ultrafilters on @xmath . For every
@xmath we define the map @xmath be letting it send every component of
@xmath to the unique component of @xmath including it, i.e. such that
@xmath . For subsets @xmath we write @xmath , and for ultrafilters
@xmath we write

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

where @xmath for two sets @xmath with @xmath denotes the collection of
all supersets @xmath of elements of @xmath , the set-theoretic
up-closure of @xmath in @xmath . Due to [ 14 , Lemma 2.1] , letting
@xmath send each @xmath to @xmath for all @xmath yields an inverse
system @xmath whose inverse limit we denote by @xmath . Hence taking the
up-closure in the definition of @xmath ensures that @xmath is an
ultrafilter on @xmath , even if there is some finite component of @xmath
whose vertex set is included in @xmath .

Next, for every @xmath and @xmath we let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath . Then by [ 14 , Lemma 2.3] the map

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is a bijection from @xmath to @xmath . Furthermore, the ends of @xmath
are precisely those of its @xmath -tangles which this map sends to a
family of principal ultrafilters. Now let @xmath be the set of all
non-principal elements of @xmath . For every @xmath we define a map
@xmath by letting

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for every @xmath . By [ 14 , Lemma 3.1] this map is well-defined, and it
sends each @xmath to the unique @xmath with @xmath . In particular, we
have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

by [ 14 , Lemma 3.2] . Combined, these Lemmas yield

###### Lemma 2.3.1.

For all @xmath the map @xmath restricts to a bijection between @xmath
and @xmath with inverse @xmath .∎

In particular, we have

###### Corollary 2.3.2.

For every @xmath each non-principal @xmath uniquely extends to an
element of @xmath .∎

For every @xmath we set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and every element of @xmath is said to witness that @xmath is an
ultrafilter tangle. By [ 14 , Lemma 3.3 & 3.4] , for every @xmath and
@xmath the non-principal ultrafilter @xmath uniquely determines @xmath
in that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

According to [ 14 , Theorem 3.6] , for each @xmath the set @xmath has a
unique least element @xmath with @xmath . Furthermore, [ 14 , Lemma 3.7]
states that, if @xmath and @xmath is not generated by @xmath for any
finite @xmath , then there is some @xmath such that @xmath .

Finally, we use @xmath to compactify @xmath . For this, we equip the
@xmath with the Stone topology, i.e. we equip @xmath with the topology
generated by declaring as basic open for every @xmath the set ¹⁷ ¹⁷ 17
In [ 14 ] , the notion for these sets is simply @xmath . Since in this
work we will compare the tangle compactification with other spaces, we
slightly modify a lot of the topological notation from [ 14 ] .

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then by [ 14 , Lemma 4.1] , the bonding maps @xmath are continuous, so [
14 , Proposition 4.2] tells us that @xmath is compact, Hausdorff and
totally disconnected. ¹⁸ ¹⁸ 18 We added ‘Hausdorff’ here. Next, for
every @xmath let @xmath be the restriction of the @xmath th projection
map @xmath , and for every @xmath and @xmath write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then by [ 14 , Lemma 4.4] , the collection

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is a basis for the topology of @xmath . Now, we extend the 1-complex of
@xmath to a topological space @xmath by declaring as open, for all
@xmath and @xmath , the sets

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and endowing @xmath with the topology this generates. Then we arrive at
the main result of [ 14 ] :

###### Theorem 2.3.3 ([14, Theorem 1]).

Let @xmath be any graph.

1.  @xmath is a compact space in which @xmath is dense and @xmath is
    totally disconnected.

2.   If @xmath is locally finite and connected, then all its @xmath
    -tangles are ends, and @xmath coincides with the Freudenthal
    compactification of @xmath .

The following is extracted from the proof of [ 14 , Theorem 1] , and it
will be reproved in a more general context in the proof of Theorem 5.4.1
:

###### Lemma 2.3.4 ([14, Proof of Theorem 1]).

For all @xmath and every @xmath we have @xmath .∎

Even though @xmath in general is not Hausdorff, Diestel remarks that
there exist two workarounds: First, the space @xmath is a Hausdorff
compactification of @xmath which still reflects the structure of @xmath
. Second, we can exchange ‘compact’ for ‘Hausdorff’ by modifying the
topology of @xmath similarly to the way we would obtain MTop from VTop
(see 2.5 for definitions of MTop and VTop ).

From now on, we will write @xmath and @xmath as well as @xmath by abuse
of notation. If @xmath is an end of @xmath , we write @xmath for the set
@xmath , and we write @xmath for the set of vertices of @xmath
dominating @xmath . Furthermore, we write @xmath and @xmath , as well as
@xmath for the union @xmath . For every @xmath we write @xmath and
@xmath . On @xmath we define the equivalence relation @xmath by letting
@xmath whenever @xmath holds.

A map @xmath with domain @xmath is a direction of @xmath if @xmath maps
every @xmath to a component of @xmath and @xmath whenever @xmath .
Clearly, the directions of @xmath are precisely the elements of the
inverse limit of @xmath , and we have seen above that these are
precisely the ends of @xmath . However, the constructive proof of the
original Theorem from Diestel and Kühn [ 5 ] linking ends to directions
yields much more:

###### Lemma 2.3.5 (@xmath).

Let @xmath be an arbitrary infinite graph and @xmath an end of @xmath
which is dominated by at most finitely many vertices. Then there exists
a sequence @xmath of non-empty finite sets of vertices of @xmath such
that for all @xmath the component @xmath includes both @xmath and @xmath
. In particular, the collection of all @xmath forms a countable
neighbourhood basis of @xmath in @xmath .

###### Proof.

Let an @xmath be an arbitrary end of @xmath which is dominated by at
most finitely many vertices, and let @xmath . We now copy the main part
of the proof of [ 5 , Theorem 2.2] for the sake of completeness: Denote
by @xmath the collection of all finite sets of vertices of @xmath . For
every @xmath we write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the component of @xmath in which every ray of @xmath has
a tail. Starting with an arbitrary non-empty @xmath we will construct a
sequence @xmath of non-empty elements of @xmath such that for all @xmath
the component @xmath includes both @xmath and @xmath .

Therefore, we proceed inductively, as follows: Suppose that @xmath has
been constructed. Since @xmath is not dominated by a vertex of @xmath ,
we find for every @xmath some @xmath with @xmath . Set @xmath and let
@xmath be the neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath . Then @xmath is finite
due to @xmath . By the choice of @xmath we have @xmath . For all @xmath
, together with @xmath this yields @xmath . Hence @xmath is connected
and avoids @xmath , so it is included in @xmath . This completes the
construction.

Since all the @xmath are disjoint, the descending sequence @xmath has
empty overall intersection: every vertex in @xmath has distance at least
@xmath from @xmath (because every @xmath - @xmath path meets all the
disjoint sets @xmath ), so no vertex can lie in @xmath for every @xmath
. We now leave the proof of [ 5 , Theorem 2.2] .

Now we for every @xmath we let @xmath . Then the collection of all open
sets @xmath forms a countable neighbourhood base of @xmath : Indeed, let
@xmath be a basic open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath . Without loss
of generality we may suppose that @xmath and write @xmath . Since @xmath
is empty, there is some @xmath such that @xmath avoids @xmath . Hence
@xmath is a connected subgraph of @xmath , so in particular it is
included in @xmath . Therefore @xmath holds as desired. ∎

#### 2.4 General Topology

If @xmath is a topological space, then a homeomorphic image of the unit
interval in @xmath is an arc in @xmath . The following Lemma is
immediate from the continuity of the quotient map:

###### Lemma 2.4.1.

If @xmath is a topological space and @xmath is an equivalence relation
on @xmath such that @xmath is T @xmath , then every element of @xmath is
a closed subset of @xmath .∎

###### Lemma 2.4.2 ([28, Theorem 7.2 a)@xmathd)]).

If @xmath and @xmath are topological spaces and @xmath is continuous,
then for each @xmath we have @xmath .

###### Lemma 2.4.3 ([28, Corollary 31.6]).

A Hausdorff topological space is path-connected if and only if it is
arc-connected.

###### Lemma 2.4.4 ([28, Corollary 13.14]).

If @xmath are continuous, @xmath is Hausdorff, and @xmath and @xmath
agree on a dense set @xmath in @xmath , then @xmath .

###### Lemma 2.4.5 (The pasting Lemma, [23, Theorem 18.3]).

Let @xmath and @xmath be topological spaces and @xmath , where @xmath
and @xmath are closed in @xmath . Let @xmath and @xmath be continuous.
If @xmath for every @xmath , then @xmath and @xmath combine to give a
continuous function @xmath , defined by setting @xmath if @xmath and
@xmath if @xmath .

The following lines on continuum theory are accumulated from [ 28 ,
Chapter 28] : A continuum is a compact, connected Hausdorff topological
space.

###### Theorem 2.4.6 ([28, Theorem 28.2]).

Let @xmath be a collection of continua in a topological space @xmath
directed by inclusion. Then @xmath is a continuum.

A continuum @xmath in a topological space @xmath is said to be
irreducible about a subset @xmath of @xmath if @xmath and no proper
subcontinuum of @xmath includes @xmath . In case of @xmath we say that
@xmath is irreducible between @xmath and @xmath .

###### Theorem 2.4.7 ([28, Theorem 28.4]).

If @xmath is a continuum, then any subset @xmath of @xmath lies in a
subcontinuum irreducible about @xmath .

If @xmath is a connected T ₁ topological space, then a cut point of
@xmath is a point @xmath such that @xmath is not connected. If @xmath is
not a cut point of @xmath , we call @xmath a noncut point of @xmath . A
cutting of @xmath is a set @xmath where @xmath is a cut point of @xmath
and @xmath together with @xmath disconnects @xmath in that @xmath and
@xmath are disjoint non-empty open subsets of @xmath with @xmath . A cut
point @xmath separates @xmath from @xmath if there is a cutting @xmath
of @xmath with @xmath and @xmath . Given @xmath we write @xmath for the
set consisting of @xmath and all the points @xmath which separate @xmath
from @xmath . The separation ordering on @xmath is defined by letting
@xmath if and only if @xmath or @xmath separates @xmath from @xmath .
This is actually a partial ordering on @xmath .

###### Theorem 2.4.8 ([28, Theorem 28.11]).

The separation ordering on @xmath is a linear ordering.

###### Theorem 2.4.9 ([28, Theorem 28.12]).

If @xmath is a continuum with exactly two noncut points @xmath and
@xmath , then @xmath and the topology on @xmath is the order topology.

Next, we have a look at compactifications: A compactification of a
topological space @xmath is an ordered pair @xmath where @xmath is a
compact topological space and @xmath is an embedding of @xmath as a
dense subset of @xmath . Sometimes we also refer to @xmath as a
compactification of @xmath if the map @xmath is clearly understood. In [
28 , chapter 19] we find the following definitions: A Hausdorff
compactification of a topological space @xmath is a compactification
@xmath of @xmath with @xmath Hausdorff. If @xmath and @xmath are
compactifications of @xmath we write @xmath whenever there exists a
continuous mapping @xmath with @xmath , i.e. such the diagram

[]

commutes. ¹⁹ ¹⁹ 19 The class of all compactifications of @xmath need not
be a set, hence we do not speak of a partial ordering. We write @xmath
whenever @xmath holds while @xmath fails. If there exists a
homeomorphism @xmath witnessing @xmath we say that @xmath and @xmath are
topologically equivalent (clearly, this is symmetric). This definition
is stated differently in [ 28 ] , but both turn out to be equivalent for
Hausdorff compactifications:

###### Lemma 2.4.10 ([28, Lemma 19.7]).

Two Hausdorff compactifications @xmath and @xmath of @xmath are
topologically equivalent if and only if @xmath holds. ²⁰ ²⁰ 20 We
adapted the statement of the original Lemma to our definition of
‘topologically equivalent’.

###### Lemma 2.4.11 ([28, Lemma 19.8]).

Suppose that @xmath and @xmath are two Hausdorff compactifications of
@xmath with @xmath witnessed by a mapping @xmath . Then the following
hold:

1.  @xmath is a homeomorphism from @xmath to @xmath .

2.  @xmath .

###### Lemma 2.4.12.

If @xmath and @xmath are two Hausdorff compactifications of @xmath and
@xmath witnesses @xmath then @xmath is unique.

###### Proof.

Let @xmath be any witness of @xmath . We have to show @xmath . By choice
of @xmath and @xmath , we have @xmath and @xmath . In particular, both
@xmath and @xmath agree on @xmath . Since @xmath is dense in @xmath ,
Lemma 2.4.4 yields @xmath as desired. ∎

Next, we have a look at two particular Hausdorff compactifications of
discrete topological spaces which are known as the one-point Hausdorff
compactification and the Stone-Čech Hausdorff compactification. The
following insights are accumulated from [ 15 , Chapter 3.5] ²¹ ²¹ 21 In
[ 15 ] the definition of ‘compactification’ seems to vary from our
definition of ‘Hausdorff compactification’ at first sight since it does
not mention ‘Hausdorff’. A closer look at the definition of ‘compact’ in
[ 15 ] reveals that it is hidden there. :

If @xmath is a discrete topological space and @xmath is a point that is
not in @xmath , then we can extend @xmath to a topological space @xmath
by declaring as open, for every finite subset @xmath of @xmath , the set
@xmath . The pair of this space and the identity on @xmath is known as
the one-point Hausdorff compactification of @xmath .

###### Lemma 2.4.13.

If @xmath is a discrete topological space and @xmath is its one-point
Hausdorff compactification, then @xmath is a least Hausdorff
compactification of @xmath in that every Hausdorff compactification
@xmath of @xmath satisfies @xmath .

More generally, if @xmath is a topological space and @xmath is a
Hausdorff compactification of @xmath such that @xmath is a singleton,
then @xmath is called the one-point Hausdorff compactification of @xmath
(which is unique up to topological equivalence) and we write @xmath as
before. In order to state an existential Theorem concerning one-point
Hausdorff compactifications we need the following definitions from [ 23
, §29] : A topological space @xmath is said to be locally compact at
@xmath if there is some compact subspace @xmath of @xmath that contains
a neighbourhood of @xmath . If @xmath is locally compact at each of its
points, then @xmath is said to be locally compact .

###### Theorem 2.4.14 ([23, Theorem 29.1 and subsequent remarks]).

A topological space @xmath has a one-point Hausdorff compactification if
and only if @xmath is locally compact and Hausdorff, but not compact.

If @xmath is a discrete topological space we let @xmath be the set of
all ultrafilters on @xmath equipped with the topology whose basic open
sets are those of the form @xmath , one for each @xmath . Furthermore,
we let @xmath map each @xmath to the non-principal ultrafilter on @xmath
generated by @xmath . Then @xmath is known as the Stone-Čech Hausdorff
compactification of @xmath .

###### Lemma 2.4.15.

If @xmath is a discrete topological space and @xmath is its Stone-Čech
Hausdorff compactification, then @xmath is a greatest Hausdorff
compactification of @xmath in that every Hausdorff compactification
@xmath of @xmath satisfies @xmath .

###### Theorem 2.4.16 ([27]).

If @xmath is a topological space, then the relation @xmath on @xmath
given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is an equivalence relation and @xmath is the maximal Hausdorff quotient
of @xmath .

If @xmath is a topological space and @xmath is given by Theorem 2.4.16 ,
then we write @xmath for the quotient space @xmath . For more details on
this topic, e.g. regarding uniqueness of @xmath and an intuitive
construction of @xmath , we redirect the reader to [ 27 ] .

If @xmath is a topological space, we write @xmath for the relation on
@xmath defined by letting @xmath whenever there exist no disjoint open
neighbourhoods of @xmath and @xmath in @xmath . Now fix a topological
space @xmath . For every ordinal @xmath we define an equivalence
relation @xmath on @xmath and a quotient space @xmath of @xmath , as
follows: Set @xmath and @xmath . For successors @xmath we let @xmath be
the quotient map and put

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

as well as @xmath . For limits @xmath we take @xmath and @xmath . Then

###### Theorem 2.4.17 ([27, Lemma 4.11 & Construction 4.12]).

If @xmath is a topological space, then there exists a minimal ordinal
@xmath with @xmath . Furthermore, @xmath holds (where @xmath is as in
Theorem 2.4.16 ), i.e. @xmath .

###### Lemma 2.4.18.

Let @xmath be a countable non-empty subset of @xmath and let @xmath be
such that @xmath . Then the map

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

has the following property: For every @xmath there is some @xmath with
@xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

For @xmath this is clear, so suppose that @xmath . Assume for a
contradiction that there is no such @xmath and put

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --

Clearly we have @xmath .

First, we show that @xmath . If @xmath then this is clear, so suppose
that @xmath . Hence

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

(at @xmath we used @xmath ). This completes the proof of @xmath .

Second, we show that @xmath . If @xmath then this is clear, so suppose
that @xmath . Hence

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

This completes the proof of @xmath .

Therefore @xmath together with @xmath implies @xmath , and hence @xmath
. If @xmath then @xmath is linear with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so in particular we find some @xmath with @xmath , contradicting our
assumption that @xmath . Otherwise if @xmath , then @xmath is linear
with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

(recall that we have @xmath due to @xmath and @xmath ). But then as
before we find some @xmath with @xmath , contradicting our assumption
that @xmath . ∎

For locally finite @xmath the space @xmath coincides with the

and we let Top be the topology on @xmath generated by these sets
together with the open sets of (the 1-complex of) @xmath . In

and VTop do not as soon as @xmath is not locally finite.

set @xmath , and taking the topology on @xmath that this generates.
Clearly, @xmath coincides with @xmath .

If every @xmath is finite, then @xmath has not ultrafilter tangle since
each ultrafilter tangle @xmath induces a non-principal on @xmath which
is impossible.

If @xmath is compact, then every @xmath must be finite: Otherwise there
is some @xmath with @xmath infinite. Covering the 1-complex of @xmath

## Part I Main results

### 3 A closer look at the tangle compactification

#### 3.1 First steps

Among the most frequently used lemmas in the field of topological
infinite graph theory is the so-called Jumping Arc Lemma:

###### Lemma 3.1.1 ([13, Lemma 8.5.3]).

Let @xmath be connected and locally finite, and let @xmath be a cut with
sides @xmath .

1.   If @xmath is finite, then @xmath (with the closures taken in @xmath
    ), and there is no arc in @xmath with one endpoint in @xmath and the
    other in @xmath .

2.   If @xmath is infinite, then @xmath , and there may be such an arc
    (for example, there exists such an arc if both graphs @xmath and
    @xmath are connected).

The first statement of this lemma admits a straightforward
generalisation to the tangle compactification:

###### Lemma 3.1.2.

Let @xmath be any graph, and let @xmath be a finite cut with sides
@xmath and @xmath . Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with the closures taken in the tangle compactification (in particular
@xmath ), and no connected subset of @xmath meets both @xmath and @xmath
.

###### Proof.

Consider @xmath and pick a bipartition @xmath of @xmath respecting
@xmath in that @xmath and @xmath hold. If @xmath is a tangle of @xmath ,
then @xmath is in one of @xmath and @xmath , say in @xmath , and this
neighbourhood witnesses @xmath . Furthermore, we have @xmath : Let
@xmath be any open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath . Then @xmath
avoids @xmath and hence must meet @xmath , since otherwise @xmath is not
dense in @xmath which is impossible. ∎

But the second statement extends only partially: Indeed, consider the
graph @xmath from Fig. 2 , and let @xmath consist precisely of the red
edges. Furthermore, let @xmath be the singleton of the vertex of
infinite degree, and let @xmath be the vertex set of the black ray. Then
@xmath is an infinite cut with sides @xmath and @xmath , but @xmath and
@xmath intersect emptily since we have @xmath and @xmath where @xmath is
the sole end of the graph @xmath . In particular, @xmath and @xmath are
connected graphs while there is no arc in @xmath with one endpoint in
@xmath and the other in @xmath since we also have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

However, since the tangle compactification of connected locally finite
graphs coincides with their Freudenthal compactification, the following
partial generalisation of the second statement of the Jumping Arc Lemma
is immediate:

###### Lemma 3.1.3.

Let @xmath be any graph, and let @xmath be an infinite cut with sides
@xmath and @xmath . If the graph @xmath is connected and locally finite,
then the tangle compactification coincides with the Freudenthal
compactification, and we have @xmath . Otherwise, @xmath is possible.
However, in case of @xmath there may be an arc in @xmath with one
endpoint in @xmath and the other in @xmath .∎

The following lemma shows that arcs in the tangle compactification do
not take advantage of the ultrafilter tangles:

###### Lemma 3.1.4.

If @xmath is any graph, then every arc in its tangle compactification
avoids all ultrafilter tangles.

###### Proof.

Let @xmath be any are in the tangle compactification of the graph @xmath
. Pick a homeomorphism @xmath and without loss of generality suppose for
a contradiction that @xmath is in @xmath .

First we show that @xmath meets @xmath : If not, then in particular
@xmath is in @xmath . Choose @xmath with @xmath and pick @xmath
witnessing this, i.e. with @xmath and @xmath . Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

induces an open bipartition on @xmath which is impossible, so without
loss of generality we may assume that @xmath is a point of @xmath .
Since @xmath is an arc, we may even assume that @xmath is a vertex
@xmath of @xmath .

Now let @xmath . Then @xmath meets @xmath , since otherwise

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

induces an open bipartition on @xmath which is impossible. Hence we may
let @xmath be an edge in @xmath that @xmath traverses and write @xmath
for the endvertex of @xmath in @xmath . Pick @xmath with @xmath . Since
@xmath is non-principal by choice of @xmath , we know that @xmath is an
infinite element of @xmath . Then @xmath meets @xmath in some @xmath ,
since otherwise

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

induces an open bipartition on @xmath which is impossible. Proceeding
inductively, we find infinitely many edges @xmath in @xmath which @xmath
traverses. Since @xmath is finite, by pigeon-hole principle we find some
@xmath which is incident with infinitely many of the @xmath . In
particular, @xmath is a point of @xmath since @xmath lies in the closure
of those @xmath . But then @xmath has degree at least 3 at @xmath , a
contradiction. ∎

To see that the tangle compactification in general is not sequentially
compact, we consider the leaves of a @xmath and apply the following
lemma:

###### Lemma 3.1.5.

Let @xmath be any graph, and let @xmath be an ultrafilter tangle. Then
no sequence of vertices of @xmath converges to @xmath in @xmath .

###### Proof.

Assume for a contradiction that there is some sequence @xmath of
vertices @xmath of @xmath with @xmath in @xmath for @xmath . Without
loss of generality we may assume that no @xmath is in @xmath . Our
sequence @xmath meets infinitely many components of @xmath , since
otherwise @xmath is a contradiction. Pick a subsequence (without loss of
generality the whole sequence) such that @xmath and @xmath live in
different components of @xmath for all @xmath . Furthermore, let @xmath
be the set of all components @xmath of @xmath for which there exists
some even @xmath with @xmath , and set @xmath .

If @xmath holds, then there is no @xmath with @xmath for all @xmath , so
@xmath is a contradiction. Otherwise @xmath similarly results in @xmath
as desired. ∎

#### 3.2 Obstructions to Hausdorffness

We define the relation @xmath on @xmath by letting @xmath whenever there
are no disjoint open neighbourhoods of @xmath and @xmath in @xmath ,
i.e. whenever @xmath and @xmath are not ‘Hausdorff topologically
distinguishable’. Clearly, @xmath in general is not transitive, hence we
denote by @xmath the transitive closure of @xmath , which is an
equivalence relation. The relations @xmath and @xmath on @xmath are
actually included in the set @xmath .

###### Lemma 3.2.1.

Let @xmath be a any graph and @xmath . Then @xmath contains precisely
those vertices @xmath of @xmath with @xmath .

###### Proof.

For the backward inclusion consider any vertex @xmath of @xmath with
@xmath and assume for a contradiction that @xmath is not in @xmath . Put
@xmath and let @xmath be the set of those components of @xmath which
contain neighbours of @xmath . Since @xmath holds, we know that @xmath
is not in @xmath , and hence @xmath must be @xmath . But then @xmath is
a singleton by the choice of @xmath and @xmath , contradicting the fact
that @xmath is non-principal.

For the forward inclusion let any @xmath be given and put @xmath . By
minimality of @xmath , the ultrafilter @xmath is generated by @xmath for
some component @xmath of @xmath . In particular, @xmath is in @xmath
since otherwise @xmath would be principal which is impossible. Put
@xmath , i.e. @xmath is the set of all components of @xmath , and note
that @xmath is in @xmath , since otherwise

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

contradicts @xmath . Since @xmath is non-principal, we know that @xmath
must be an infinite subset of @xmath . Now assume for a contradiction
that @xmath fails, witnessed by some basic open neighbourhoods @xmath of
@xmath and @xmath of @xmath in @xmath , without loss of generality with
@xmath . Let @xmath consist of those @xmath avoiding @xmath , and note
that @xmath is cofinite in @xmath , so @xmath holds as well as @xmath .
Together with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

this yields @xmath . Now set @xmath which is in @xmath and hence must be
infinite. Since @xmath is a subset of @xmath , we know that @xmath sends
at least one edge to each of the infinitely many @xmath . In particular,
@xmath does send at least one edge to @xmath , so @xmath and @xmath must
meet, a contradiction. ∎

###### Corollary 3.2.2.

Let @xmath and @xmath be given. Then for every @xmath the set of all
components of @xmath which send an edge to every vertex in @xmath is
contained in @xmath .

###### Proof.

If @xmath is empty, then @xmath is the set of all components of @xmath
which send an edge to every vertex in @xmath , and @xmath holds since
@xmath is an ultrafilter on @xmath . Hence we may suppose that @xmath is
non-empty.

For every vertex @xmath of @xmath we denote by @xmath the set of all
components of @xmath which send an edge to @xmath . Then every set
@xmath is contained in @xmath : Otherwise, for some @xmath the set
@xmath of all components of @xmath which do not send an edge to @xmath
is contained in @xmath . But then @xmath is an open neighbourhood of
@xmath in @xmath which avoids every basic open neighbourhood of @xmath ,
contradicting Lemma 3.2.1 . Hence @xmath is contained in @xmath for
every @xmath in @xmath . Since @xmath is finite, the set @xmath is also
in @xmath . ∎

###### Observation 3.2.3.

A graph @xmath is not planar as soon as there is some @xmath or @xmath
with @xmath or @xmath , respectively.

###### Proof.

If @xmath satisfies @xmath , then we let @xmath be the set of all
components of @xmath whose neighbourhood is precisely @xmath . By
Corollary 3.2.2 , we have @xmath , so @xmath must be infinite. Consider
the subgraph @xmath and obtain @xmath from @xmath by contracting every
element of @xmath to a singleton, deleting loops and reducing parallel
edges. Then @xmath is a @xmath and a minor of @xmath , so the statement
follows from Kuratowski’s Theorem ( [ 13 , Theorem 4.4.6] ).

If @xmath is dominated by three distinct vertices, pick a ray in @xmath
which avoids all three vertices, and find for each of the three vertices
an infinite fan to that ray such that no two fans meet (this can be
achieved by inductively constructing all three fans simultaneously,
adding paths in turn). Then it is easy to find a @xmath in the union of
the ray and the three infinite fans. Again, the statement follows from
Kuratowski’s Theorem ( [ 13 , Theorem 4.4.6] ). ∎

###### Lemma 3.2.4.

Let @xmath and @xmath be two distinct vertices of @xmath . Then the
following are equivalent:

1.   There exist infinitely many independent @xmath – @xmath paths in
    @xmath .

2.   There is some @xmath satisfying @xmath .

###### Proof.

(i) @xmath (ii). Let @xmath be some set of infinitely many independent
@xmath – @xmath paths in @xmath and discard from it the trivial @xmath –
@xmath path. Write @xmath and choose @xmath to be some non-principal
ultrafilter on @xmath . Furthermore, put @xmath . Given @xmath with
@xmath , we define an ultrafilter @xmath on @xmath , as follows:

Let @xmath denote the set of those @xmath for which @xmath avoids @xmath
. For every @xmath we write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then for each bipartition @xmath of @xmath , the set @xmath is a
bipartition of @xmath : indeed, for @xmath we have @xmath if and only if
there is some @xmath containing @xmath (since @xmath implies that @xmath
is connected in @xmath ), so @xmath is a bipartition of @xmath as
claimed. In order to define @xmath , we have to choose for every
bipartition @xmath of @xmath precisely one of @xmath and @xmath , which
we do now: Since @xmath meets only finitely many of the @xmath while
@xmath is non-principal and @xmath can be written as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we know that @xmath picks exactly one of @xmath and @xmath , say @xmath
. Then we let @xmath choose @xmath , and @xmath otherwise. This
completes the definition of @xmath , and clearly @xmath inherits the
filter properties from @xmath .

Our next aim is to show that the @xmath are compatible with respect to
the bonding maps of the inverse system of ultrafilters. For this, let
@xmath both be supersets of @xmath and write @xmath for the ultrafilter
@xmath on @xmath . Assume for a contradiction that @xmath and @xmath are
distinct, and consider a bipartition @xmath of @xmath witnessing this
with @xmath and @xmath , say. By definition of @xmath we find some
@xmath with @xmath . Therefore, @xmath holds due to @xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so @xmath is in @xmath as well as @xmath , a contradiction. Hence the
@xmath are compatible as desired.

Finally we extend the family of the @xmath to an element @xmath of
@xmath by letting @xmath for every @xmath with @xmath . Then @xmath
holds: Otherwise there is some basic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath
and some basic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath with @xmath . Without
loss of generality we may assume that @xmath is included in @xmath .
Thus @xmath implies @xmath by choice of @xmath , so in particular @xmath
is infinite since @xmath is non-principal. Hence infinitely many of the
@xmath meet @xmath , therefore witnessing that @xmath sends infinitely
many edges to @xmath . In particular, @xmath does send an edge to @xmath
, so @xmath and @xmath must meet, a contradiction. Similarly, @xmath
holds.

(ii) @xmath (i). If @xmath is an end tangle, then put @xmath and pick
some @xmath – @xmath path @xmath in the sole component @xmath generating
@xmath . Next, put @xmath and pick some @xmath – @xmath path @xmath in
the sole component @xmath generating @xmath . Proceeding inductively, we
find some disjoint @xmath – @xmath paths @xmath for every @xmath . Then
@xmath is a set of infinitely many independent @xmath – @xmath paths.
Alternatively, it suffices to note that @xmath must be dominated by
@xmath and @xmath .

If @xmath is an ultrafilter tangle, then @xmath holds by Lemma 3.2.1 .
Let @xmath be the set of all components of @xmath sending an edge to
@xmath , and define @xmath analogously. Then @xmath implies that both
@xmath and @xmath are in @xmath , and hence @xmath is an infinite subset
of @xmath . Next we choose some infinite subset @xmath of @xmath , and
for every @xmath we pick some @xmath – @xmath path @xmath in @xmath .
Again, @xmath is a set of infinitely many independent @xmath – @xmath
paths. ∎

###### Corollary 3.2.5.

Let @xmath and @xmath be two distinct vertices of @xmath . Then the
following are equivalent:

1.  @xmath .

2.   There is some @xmath containing @xmath and @xmath such that no
    @xmath disjoint from @xmath separates @xmath and @xmath in @xmath .

###### Proof.

(ii) @xmath (i). Let @xmath be as in (ii). Hence, we inductively find
infinitely many @xmath – @xmath paths in @xmath which meet only in
@xmath . By pigeon-hole principle, infinitely many of them meet exactly
the same vertices of @xmath and traverse these in the same order
(starting in @xmath ), say @xmath for some @xmath . We denote the set of
these paths by @xmath and write @xmath for each @xmath and @xmath .
Applying, for every @xmath , Lemma 3.2.4 to @xmath and the vertices
@xmath and @xmath yields some @xmath with @xmath . Hence

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (1)
  -- -------- -- -----

holds as desired.

(i) @xmath (ii). Suppose that @xmath holds, witnessed by some vertices
@xmath of @xmath and some @xmath satisfying ( 1 ). Applying, for every
@xmath , Lemma 3.2.4 to @xmath yields some collection @xmath of
infinitely many independent paths from @xmath to @xmath . Set @xmath .
Then for every @xmath disjoint from @xmath we find for every @xmath some
@xmath such that @xmath avoids @xmath . Then @xmath admits a path from
@xmath to @xmath avoiding @xmath . ∎

#### 3.3 Critical vertex sets

In this section we yield a combinatorial description of the sets @xmath
of ultrafilter tangles.

For every @xmath and @xmath we write @xmath for the set of components of
@xmath whose neighbourhood is precisely @xmath . Furthermore, we let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Observation 3.3.1.

Suppose that @xmath and @xmath are given. Then every @xmath meets only
finitely many elements of @xmath , so the set @xmath is cofinite in
@xmath , and in particular @xmath holds. On the other hand, @xmath
implies @xmath : since every component in @xmath has neighbourhood
precisely @xmath , we have @xmath .

We call @xmath critical if @xmath holds, i.e. if @xmath is infinite.
Moreover, we write @xmath for the set of all critical @xmath . Then
Observation 3.3.1 implies @xmath .

###### Lemma 3.3.2.

For every @xmath and every @xmath we have @xmath and @xmath .

###### Proof.

Put @xmath . By Corollary 3.2.2 (applied to @xmath ) we know that @xmath
is in @xmath . In particular, @xmath is infinite, witnessing @xmath .
Hence @xmath holds by Observation 3.3.1 . Let @xmath be the set obtained
from @xmath by discarding the finitely many components meeting @xmath
from it, i.e. set @xmath . Then @xmath holds. Since @xmath is cofinite
in @xmath we have @xmath . Recall that by definition of @xmath we know
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since @xmath by definition is a subset of @xmath , the equation above
yields @xmath as claimed. ∎

###### Lemma 3.3.3.

For all @xmath , every @xmath and each infinite @xmath there is some
@xmath with @xmath and @xmath .

###### Proof.

Choose some non-principal ultrafilter @xmath on @xmath which contains
@xmath . By Corollary 2.3.2 , @xmath uniquely extends to an element
@xmath of @xmath . In particular we have @xmath . For every @xmath the
set @xmath is a singleton contained in @xmath , therefore witnessing
@xmath , so @xmath follows. ∎

###### Lemma 3.3.4.

The map @xmath is a bijection between @xmath and @xmath .

###### Proof.

The map is well defined by Lemma 3.3.2 . By definition of @xmath it is
injective. It remains to verify surjectivity. If @xmath is in @xmath ,
then @xmath holds, and Lemma 3.3.3 yields some @xmath with @xmath and
@xmath , so @xmath gets mapped to @xmath as desired. ∎

###### Theorem 3.3.5.

For every two distinct vertices @xmath and @xmath of @xmath the
following are equivalent:

1.   There exist infinitely many independent @xmath – @xmath paths in
    @xmath .

2.   There exists some @xmath with @xmath .

3.   There exists some end of @xmath dominated by both @xmath and @xmath
    or
    there exists some @xmath with @xmath .

4.   There exists an end of @xmath dominated by both @xmath and @xmath
    or
    there exists some @xmath containing both @xmath and @xmath .

###### Proof.

(i) @xmath (ii) is Lemma 3.2.4 .

(ii) @xmath (iii) is due to Lemma 3.2.1 .

(iii) @xmath (iv) is due to Lemma 3.3.4 . ∎

###### Corollary 3.3.6.

For every @xmath the following hold:

1.   For every @xmath the set @xmath meets at most one component of
    @xmath .

2.   Every @xmath meets at most one component of @xmath .

3.   For every @xmath the set @xmath meets at most one component of
    @xmath .

∎

###### Lemma 3.3.7.

There exists a connected infinite graph @xmath such that @xmath is an
infinite chain with respect to inclusion.

###### Proof.

Put @xmath , and let @xmath be a collection of pairwise disjoint
countably infinite sets @xmath avoiding @xmath . For every @xmath write
@xmath . Let @xmath be the graph on @xmath in which, for every @xmath ,
each @xmath is joined precisely to all @xmath . Then @xmath consists
precisely of the vertices of @xmath of infinite degree (every @xmath has
degree @xmath ), and for every @xmath we have @xmath witnessed by @xmath
where @xmath is the component of @xmath including all @xmath and @xmath
with @xmath . Every finite @xmath which is distinct from all @xmath
misses some @xmath for some @xmath . Thus @xmath is empty, so @xmath is
not in @xmath . In particular, we have @xmath . ∎

###### Lemma 3.3.8.

Let @xmath and @xmath be given, and let @xmath send infinitely many
edges to @xmath . Then there is some @xmath with @xmath .

###### Proof.

Assume for a contradiction that no such @xmath exists. We will construct
a cover of @xmath consisting of open sets which does not admit a finite
subcover. For this, we cover @xmath as follows:

For @xmath we pick @xmath .

For every edge @xmath we chose @xmath .

For each @xmath we pick @xmath .

For each @xmath we have @xmath since @xmath fails. Thus we find some
@xmath with @xmath and @xmath living in distinct components of @xmath ,
and we choose @xmath which avoids @xmath .

For every @xmath we have @xmath by Lemma 3.2.1 since @xmath fails. Then
we choose @xmath (which contains @xmath by Lemma 3.3.2 and avoids @xmath
due to @xmath ). This completes the construction of the cover.

Since every @xmath with @xmath is covered only by @xmath , our cover of
@xmath has no finite subcover, contradicting the compactness of @xmath .
∎

###### Lemma 3.3.9.

The vertices in @xmath are precisely the vertices of infinite degree.

###### Proof.

By Lemma 3.3.4 we have @xmath . Clearly, every vertex in @xmath has
infinite degree. Conversely, for every vertex @xmath of infinite degree
there is some @xmath with @xmath by Lemma 3.3.8 . If @xmath is an end,
then @xmath follows. Otherwise @xmath is an ultrafilter tangle, and
Lemma 3.2.1 yields @xmath . ∎

###### Corollary 3.3.10.

The tangle compactification of @xmath is Hausdorff if and only if @xmath
is locally finite.

###### Proof.

If @xmath is locally finite, then the tangle compactification coincides
with @xmath which is Hausdorff. Conversely, if the tangle
compactification is Hausdorff, then clearly @xmath is empty, and by
Lemma 3.2.1 we know that for each ultrafilter tangle its set @xmath must
be empty. Corollary 3.3.9 then yields that @xmath is locally finite. ∎

#### 3.4 ETop as a quotient

The coarsest topology for arbitrary infinite graphs known to be of any
use is ETop . In general, it is impossible to obtain ETop from VTop as a
quotient. Indeed, suppose that @xmath is a @xmath . Since this graph has
no ends and every two vertices are finitely separable, no two points of
@xmath may be identified. But for this @xmath , the topology VTop does
not coincide with ETop , since the set of all leaves of @xmath is closed
in VTop but not in ETop . Now if we consider the tangle compactification
of @xmath instead of VTop and identify all of the (ultrafilter) tangles
of @xmath with the center vertex, the resulting space is homeomorphic to
ETop . ²³ ²³ 23 Indeed, an open neighbourhood of the center vertex and
all ultrafilter tangles may miss at most finitely many leaves, since
otherwise we could construct an ultrafilter tangle outside of that
neighbourhood.

In this chapter we generalise the common notion of ‘finitely separable’
from vertices to @xmath -tangles in order to define an equivalence
relation on the tangle compactification whose quotient we show to be
homeomorphic to @xmath .

If @xmath and @xmath are two points of @xmath and @xmath is a finite cut
of @xmath with sides @xmath and @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath ,
then we call @xmath and @xmath finitely separable . If @xmath and @xmath
are both vertices of @xmath , then by Lemma 3.1.2 this definition
coincides with the standard definition of ‘finitely separable’ for
vertices. Letting @xmath whenever @xmath and @xmath are not finitely
separable defines an equivalence relation on @xmath :

###### Lemma 3.4.1.

The relation @xmath is transitive.

###### Proof.

Given @xmath with @xmath and @xmath we have to show @xmath . Assume for
a contradiction that @xmath holds, witnessed by some finite cut @xmath
of @xmath with sides @xmath and @xmath . By Lemma 3.1.2 we have
precisely one of @xmath and @xmath , and each case contradicts one of
@xmath and @xmath . ∎

Hence @xmath is well defined, and it is a compact space since @xmath is.
Furthermore, we know that

###### Observation 3.4.2.

If @xmath is locally finite and connected, then @xmath .

The next few technical Lemmas already give a hint that @xmath and @xmath
might be related:

###### Lemma 3.4.3.

Let @xmath be a finite cut of @xmath with sides @xmath and @xmath , and
let @xmath consist of precisely one inner edge point @xmath from each
@xmath . If this Lemma is applied outside the context of any @xmath ,
then we tacitly assume @xmath . Put

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for both @xmath (with the closures taken in @xmath ). Then both @xmath
are @xmath -closed open sets and we have @xmath as well as @xmath .

###### Proof.

Since @xmath and the union of the @xmath with @xmath and @xmath are
closed, by Lemma 3.1.2 we know that @xmath is open. Similarly, @xmath is
open. ∎

###### Corollary 3.4.4.

@xmath is Hausdorff.∎

###### Corollary 3.4.5.

Let @xmath be an arc. Then @xmath is dense in @xmath .∎

###### Lemma 3.4.6.

Let @xmath be any graph with only finitely many components. Then every
point of @xmath is exactly of one of the following forms:

1.   an inner edge point;

2.  @xmath for some vertex @xmath of @xmath ;

3.  @xmath for some undominated end @xmath of @xmath .

If @xmath is some undominated end of @xmath , then @xmath is not
necessarily of the form (iii) , e.g. consider the example from Fig. 16
where it is of the form (ii) .

###### Proof.

Consider any point @xmath of @xmath .

If @xmath contains an inner edge point, then @xmath is of the form (i).

If @xmath contains a vertex, then @xmath is of the form (ii).

If @xmath contains some @xmath ,then @xmath is of the form (ii) for each
@xmath (which is non-empty since @xmath has only finitely many
components).

Finally suppose that @xmath , and suppose for a contradiction that
@xmath is not of the form (iii), i.e. that @xmath is not a singleton.
Pick distinct elements @xmath of @xmath and let @xmath witness @xmath .
Then since @xmath avoids @xmath there exists for every @xmath some
finite cut @xmath with sides @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath lives in
@xmath . Let @xmath and @xmath as well as @xmath which is a finite cut
due to @xmath . Now @xmath implies that there is some component @xmath
of @xmath in which both @xmath and @xmath live. Since @xmath lives in
@xmath for every @xmath and @xmath is finite, we know that @xmath . In
particular, @xmath avoids @xmath , and hence is a connected subgraph of
@xmath . But then @xmath follows, a contradiction. ∎

###### Corollary 3.4.7.

Let @xmath be any graph with only finitely many components. Furthermore
let @xmath be given together with some bipartition @xmath of @xmath and
two distinct points @xmath and @xmath of @xmath such that @xmath and
@xmath . If @xmath then @xmath meets @xmath .

###### Proof.

Assume for a contradiction that @xmath avoids @xmath . By Lemma 3.4.6
there is some vertex @xmath of @xmath in @xmath , and since @xmath
avoids @xmath there is some @xmath with @xmath , without loss of
generality with @xmath . Now @xmath implies that there exists for every
@xmath some finite cut @xmath of @xmath with sides @xmath and @xmath
such that @xmath and @xmath . Put @xmath and @xmath , and let @xmath be
the finite cut @xmath . Let @xmath be the component of @xmath containing
@xmath . Then @xmath is a connected subgraph of @xmath avoiding @xmath
and @xmath contains @xmath , so we have @xmath . Next consider the
finite bond @xmath . Then @xmath (due to @xmath ) together with @xmath
implies @xmath , and hence Lemma 3.1.2 yields @xmath . Thus @xmath
witnesses @xmath , a contradiction. ∎

For the rest of this chapter, @xmath is assumed to be connected.

Next we define an inverse system of multigraphs whose inverse limit is
homeomorphic to @xmath . For this, we begin by defining the multigraphs:
For every @xmath we denote by @xmath the (multi-)graph which is obtained
from @xmath by contracting the vertex sets of the components of @xmath
(therefore turning edges of these components into loops). For the rest
of this chapter let @xmath be ordered by inclusion. We equip @xmath with
the topology generated by the following basis: For inner edge points we
declare as open the usual neighbourhoods. For every vertex @xmath of
@xmath we declare as open all neighbourhoods of the form

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (2)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath denotes the set of all loops at @xmath , @xmath for every
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath is some closed interval included in @xmath
for every @xmath .

For every @xmath we define bonding maps @xmath which are the identity on
@xmath and which send every vertex @xmath of @xmath to the vertex of
@xmath whose corresponding component of @xmath includes the component of
@xmath corresponding to @xmath . The following Lemmas are case checking:

###### Lemma 3.4.8.

The maps @xmath are continuous.∎

###### Lemma 3.4.9.

The maps @xmath are compatible.∎

###### Observation 3.4.10.

The @xmath are compact and Hausdorff.

Since @xmath is an inverse system of non-empty compact Hausdorff spaces,
its inverse limit

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is again non-empty, compact and Hausdorff by Lemma 2.2.3 . Furthermore,
Miraftab [ 22 ] showed that

###### Lemma 3.4.11.

If @xmath is a connected graph, then @xmath is homeomorphic to @xmath .

Given @xmath we define @xmath as follows: Let @xmath be given. By Lemma
3.4.6 there are three cases to distinguish: If @xmath is an inner edge
point of some edge @xmath , then we let @xmath map @xmath to @xmath .
For @xmath with @xmath some vertex of @xmath we let @xmath map @xmath to
the vertex of @xmath whose corresponding component of @xmath contains
@xmath . This is well-defined since the finite cuts of @xmath are finite
cuts of @xmath . Finally, if @xmath we let @xmath map @xmath to the
vertex of @xmath whose corresponding component includes a tail of every
ray in @xmath . ²⁴ ²⁴ 24 If @xmath has infinitely many components, then
there is some @xmath with @xmath and there is no natural choice for
@xmath in @xmath . Furthermore, no @xmath would be compact. Hence we
require @xmath to be connected.

###### Lemma 3.4.12.

The maps @xmath are compatible.

###### Proof.

Let @xmath and @xmath be given. We have to show that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

holds, but this is clear from the definition of @xmath and @xmath . ∎

###### Lemma 3.4.13.

The maps @xmath are continuous surjections.

###### Proof.

Clearly, the @xmath are surjective by construction. Let @xmath be given
together with @xmath some basic open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath .
By Lemma 3.4.6 we distinguish three cases:

If @xmath is an inner edge point we are done, so assume that @xmath is
of the form @xmath for some vertex @xmath of @xmath . Hence @xmath is a
vertex of @xmath and @xmath is of the form ( 2 ). Let @xmath be the
component of @xmath corresponding to @xmath . Then the non-loop edges at
@xmath in @xmath form a finite cut @xmath of @xmath and thus also of
@xmath . Put @xmath and use Lemma 3.4.3 to yield a tripartition @xmath .
Since @xmath is one side of @xmath in @xmath and @xmath , we without
loss of generality have @xmath , so @xmath maps @xmath into @xmath .

Finally assume @xmath where @xmath is an undominated end of @xmath .
Then @xmath is a vertex of @xmath and we are done by the previous case.
∎

###### Theorem 3.4.14.

If @xmath is a connected graph, then @xmath is homeomorphic to the
quotient space @xmath of @xmath . In particular, @xmath is homeomorphic
to @xmath .

###### First proof.

We start by letting @xmath map @xmath to @xmath . Then @xmath is an
element of @xmath by Lemma 3.4.12 and @xmath is injective: Consider
distinct elements @xmath and @xmath of @xmath . Without loss of
generality none of @xmath and @xmath is an inner edge point. Let @xmath
be some finite cut of @xmath witnessing @xmath , then @xmath follows as
desired. But @xmath is also a continuous surjection by Lemmas 3.4.12 ,
3.4.13 and 2.2.6 . Therefore, @xmath is a continuous bijection from a
compact space onto a Hausdorff space. By general topology, @xmath is a
homeomorphism, so @xmath is homeomorphic to @xmath as claimed. Due to
Lemma 3.4.11 , we also know that @xmath is homeomorphic to @xmath . ∎

###### Second proof (sketch).

Define @xmath using Lemma 3.4.6 as follows: Let @xmath be given. If
@xmath is an inner edge point put @xmath . Else if @xmath is of the form
@xmath for some vertex @xmath of @xmath let @xmath send @xmath to the
point of @xmath containing @xmath . Otherwise @xmath is of the form
@xmath for some end @xmath of @xmath and we put @xmath . It is
straightforward to check that @xmath is a well defined bijection. Since
@xmath is compact and @xmath is Hausdorff, it suffices to check that
@xmath is continuous, which easily follows from Lemma 3.4.3 . ∎

###### Corollary 3.4.15.

If @xmath is a countable connected graph and @xmath satisfies @xmath ,
then @xmath is homeomorphic to @xmath .

###### Proof.

By [ 18 , Theorem 3.1] we know that @xmath and @xmath are homeomorphic.
Hence Theorem 3.4.14 implies that @xmath and @xmath are also
homeomorphic. ∎

###### Observation 3.4.16.

In Section 5.3 we learn about a new compactification @xmath which is
quite similar to @xmath . For this space, Lemmas 3.1.2 , 3.4.3 and 3.4.6
admit straightforward analogues, so @xmath is also a quotient of @xmath
.

### 4 The tangle compactification as inverse limit

#### 4.1 Introduction

In recent years, inverse limits emerged as useful tools to obtain ‘limit
objects’ of graphs, such as circles and TSTs, from compatible choices of
‘finite objects’ of some carefully chosen ‘finite minors’. Such inverse
systems are known for the Freudenthal compactification of locally finite
graphs ( [ 13 , Theorem 8.7.2, 5th edition] ) and for @xmath with ETop (
[ 22 ] , or see @xmath from section 3.4 ). In this chapter, we will set
up such an inverse system whose inverse limit describes the tangle
compactification. The ‘finite minors’ we are going to use for this
actually are multigraphs with finite vertex set and possibly infinite
edge set, and they are obtained from @xmath by contraction of possibly
non-connected sets of vertices. Hence the question comes to mind whether
there is a better inverse system based on finite minors of @xmath ?

First, we consider an example graph whose tangle compactification cannot
be described in a meaningful way by an inverse system of minors. Let
@xmath be the graph pictured in Fig. 3 , and for every @xmath denote by
@xmath the ray in @xmath starting at the centre vertex of the infinite
star. As Diestel showed in [ 14 , Example 1.9] , every ultrafilter on
the naturals induces an @xmath -tangle of this graph. Indeed, since the
sides of a finite order separation of this graph induce a bipartition of
its end space, and hence of the naturals via the enumeration @xmath of
@xmath , we can use the ‘big’ elements of the ultrafilter to declare the
corresponding sides of the finite order separations as ‘big’ (i.e.
orient the finite order separations such that their big sides induce
elements of the ultrafilter). Then the principal ultrafilters on the
naturals induce precisely the end-tangles of this graph. Interestingly,
it is not possible to describe the tangle compactification of this graph
as an inverse limit of minors of @xmath (not even infinite ones), as
long as we deem the following premise meaningful:

If @xmath is an inverse system of minors @xmath of @xmath and for every
@xmath there is a mapping @xmath such that @xmath is a homeomorphism,
then for every @xmath the map @xmath sends every ultrafilter tangle of
@xmath to an infinite branch set of @xmath which is not included in some
@xmath .

Now if @xmath and @xmath are distinct non-principal ultrafilters on the
naturals, they induce distinct ultrafilter tangles @xmath and @xmath of
@xmath . Since @xmath is injective, there is some @xmath in @xmath such
that @xmath sends the two ultrafilter tangles to different branch sets
of @xmath . Since @xmath is a minor of @xmath , its branch sets are
connected, so by the premise they both meet in the centre vertex of the
infinite star, which contradicts the fact that distinct branch sets are
disjoint. Hence contracting non-connected sets of vertices in general
cannot be avoided.

But perhaps we can use finite multigraphs instead? Indeed, this is
possible, and as it will turn out there is an easy way to obtain such
multigraphs from ours. But making their edge sets finite comes at the
cost of quality of life, which is why we forgo this option.

#### 4.2 Setup

Given a graph @xmath , for every @xmath we denote by @xmath the set of
all finite partitions of @xmath . Then we let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If @xmath is in @xmath , we denote by @xmath the finite partition of
@xmath induced by @xmath and the singleton subsets of @xmath . Letting
@xmath whenever @xmath and @xmath refines @xmath defines a directed
partial ordering on @xmath :

###### Lemma 4.2.1.

@xmath is a directed poset.

###### Proof.

The poset properties are inherited from the subset and the refinement
relation; it remains to verify that @xmath is directed: For this, let
any two elements @xmath and @xmath of @xmath be given. First, we will
define finite partitions @xmath and @xmath of @xmath such that @xmath
and @xmath hold; but this is easy: Recall that the map @xmath sends
every component of @xmath to the unique component of @xmath containing
it, so the preimage of every partition class @xmath of @xmath under
@xmath consists precisely of those components of @xmath which are
included in some component of @xmath that is also an element of @xmath .
Hence letting

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

will do. Finally, choosing @xmath to be the coarsest refinement of
@xmath and @xmath results in a finite partition of @xmath which
satisfies the two inequalities

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

so we are done by transitivity. ∎

Next we define the topological spaces of our inverse limit. For ever
@xmath , we let @xmath be the multigraph on @xmath whose edges are
precisely the cross-edges of @xmath . The vertices of @xmath that are
singleton subsets @xmath of @xmath we consider to be vertices of @xmath
and refer to them as @xmath ; the other vertices of @xmath are its dummy
vertices ²⁵ ²⁵ 25 This definition does not coincide with that of dummy
vertices of the @xmath from the construction of @xmath in [ 13 , 5th
edition] : e.g. if some @xmath is a singleton, but not a subset of
@xmath , then @xmath is a dummy vertex here but a non-dummy vertex in [
13 ] . . Now we let @xmath be the topological space obtained from the
ground set of the 1-complex of @xmath by endowing it with the topology
generated by the following basis:

For inner edge points we choose the usual open neighbourhoods, and for
vertices @xmath we choose as open neighbourhoods the sets of the form
@xmath where the inner edge points @xmath may be chosen individually for
each @xmath . Finally, for dummy vertices @xmath of @xmath we declare as
open the sets of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is some finite subset of @xmath , and for every @xmath the
point @xmath is an arbitrary inner edge point of @xmath while @xmath is
the endvertex of @xmath in @xmath . ²⁶ ²⁶ 26 The purpose of @xmath is to
make our topological spaces T @xmath . Only allowing @xmath would also
work, but then our topological spaces are not T @xmath while the tangle
compactification is. This completes the definition of the basis.

The spaces @xmath are easily seen to be compact. To complete the setup
of our inverse system, for all @xmath we choose the bonding map

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which sends the vertices of @xmath to the vertices of @xmath including
them; which is the identity on the interior of the edges of @xmath that
are also edges of @xmath ; and which sends any other edge of @xmath to
the dummy vertex of @xmath that includes both its endvertices in @xmath
. An easy proof by cases shows that these bonding maps are continuous.
²⁷ ²⁷ 27 This is basically the definition of Diestel. Therefore, we
arrived at an inverse system @xmath , and we set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Before we verify that @xmath describes the tangle compactification, we
introduce some notation concerning @xmath : If @xmath is an open set in
@xmath for some @xmath , then we denote by @xmath the open subset @xmath
of @xmath where @xmath is the whole space @xmath for all @xmath except
for @xmath , which we choose to be @xmath . Given @xmath we define
@xmath to be the continuous projection map

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Finally, whenever @xmath is an element of @xmath we denote @xmath by
@xmath .

Before we verify that @xmath suits its purpose, we have a last look at
their possibly infinite edge sets. Obviously, the multigraphs @xmath in
general are not finite, but their vertex set is finite. It is possible
to turn these multigraphs into finite graphs, simply by deleting the
inner edge points of edges incident with dummy vertices. If we then
think of these inner edge points as ‘hidden’ in the dummy vertices
incident with the edges containing them, we can adjust the bonding maps
so as to yield another inverse system whose inverse limit would still
describe the tangle compactification. But obviously, the deletion of
these points renders this inverse system useless, since it contradicts
our aim to improve everyone’s quality of life. Therefore, we decided to
keep these points, and instead rely on the compactness of the spaces
@xmath .

#### 4.3 The homeomorphism

###### Theorem 4.3.1.

If @xmath is an arbitrary infinite graph, then the tangle
compactification @xmath of @xmath is homeomorphic to @xmath .

###### Proof.

The first task is to construct a bijection @xmath . For this, let an
arbitrary @xmath be given. We distinguish two cases:

First assume that there is some @xmath such that @xmath is not a dummy
vertex of @xmath , so @xmath is an element of @xmath or an inner edge
point of @xmath . In this case we let @xmath , which is a well defined
choice: If @xmath and @xmath are two such points we pick some @xmath .
Then the point @xmath is not a dummy vertex either, so the definition of
@xmath and @xmath implies @xmath .

In the second case, every @xmath is a dummy vertex. Then for every
@xmath we let @xmath be the collection of all the sets @xmath for which
there is some finite partition @xmath of @xmath such that @xmath , and
put @xmath . To complete the definition of @xmath , it remains to show
that @xmath is an element of @xmath . We start by verifying that

###### Claim 1.

The @xmath are ultrafilters on @xmath .

###### Proof of the Claim.

Since dummy vertices formally are non-empty sets of vertices, the empty
set is not in @xmath .

Next we show that, for every two elements @xmath and @xmath of @xmath ,
the intersection @xmath is again an element of @xmath . Given two
elements @xmath and @xmath of @xmath we choose witnesses @xmath and
@xmath of @xmath and @xmath , respectively. Let @xmath be the coarsest
refinement of @xmath and @xmath , and let @xmath be the partition class
satisfying @xmath . Since @xmath and by compatibility, the only choice
for @xmath is the dummy vertex @xmath . Hence @xmath witnesses that
@xmath is contained in @xmath .

Now we show that @xmath is upwards closed. For this, let any @xmath be
given together with a superset @xmath ; we have to show @xmath . Pick
some witness @xmath of @xmath and let @xmath be the coarsest refinement
of @xmath and the bipartition @xmath of @xmath . Assume for a
contradiction that @xmath is not the dummy vertex @xmath of @xmath .
Then @xmath must be the dummy vertex @xmath since it is the only other
dummy vertex of @xmath . Now let @xmath be the partition class of @xmath
satisfying @xmath . By compatibility we know that @xmath is a subset of
both @xmath and @xmath . But then, since @xmath is a subset of @xmath ,
we also know that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

holds, which is a contradiction since @xmath is non-empty.

So far we have seen that @xmath is a filter, so finally we verify that
@xmath is a maximal one. For this, consider any bipartition @xmath of
@xmath ; we show that exactly one of @xmath and @xmath is contained in
@xmath . Since @xmath is a dummy vertex, we know that at least one of
@xmath and @xmath is in @xmath , say @xmath . Now assume for a
contradiction that @xmath is contained in @xmath , too, witnessed by
some @xmath . Then @xmath refines the bipartition @xmath since @xmath is
a partition class of @xmath . In particular @xmath holds, and @xmath is
the dummy vertex @xmath of @xmath . But then, by definition of @xmath ,
the only possibility for @xmath is the dummy vertex @xmath of @xmath ,
which is a contradiction. ∎

###### Claim 2.

For all @xmath we have @xmath .

###### Proof of the Claim.

Let @xmath be given. By Claim 1 both @xmath and @xmath are ultrafilters
on @xmath and @xmath , respectively, so @xmath is again an ultrafilter
on @xmath . Assume for a contradiction that @xmath and @xmath are
distinct, and pick some bipartition @xmath of @xmath with @xmath
containing @xmath and @xmath containing @xmath . By definition of @xmath
there is some @xmath in @xmath witnessing @xmath , i.e. @xmath satisfies
@xmath . Now choose witnesses @xmath and @xmath of @xmath and @xmath ,
respectively, and pick some @xmath in @xmath with @xmath . Since @xmath
holds by definition and @xmath includes @xmath , the set @xmath is
included in @xmath . But @xmath is the dummy vertex @xmath of @xmath ,
and @xmath is the dummy vertex @xmath of @xmath , so @xmath implies
@xmath , and hence @xmath (by definition of @xmath and @xmath ) yields
the desired contradiction. ∎

Therefore, @xmath is indeed an element of @xmath and our construction of
@xmath is complete. It remains to show that @xmath is bijective and
bicontinuous; we begin with injectivity:

###### Claim 3.

@xmath is injective.

###### Proof of the Claim.

Let @xmath and @xmath be two distinct elements of @xmath with @xmath for
some @xmath . If @xmath and @xmath or vice versa, we are done, so
suppose that @xmath and @xmath either are both in @xmath or both in
@xmath .

For the first case suppose that both @xmath and @xmath are in @xmath ,
witnessed by @xmath and @xmath , respectively, so neither of @xmath and
@xmath is a dummy vertex. Pick some @xmath and note that, by definition
of the bonding maps and well-definition of @xmath , we have @xmath as
well as @xmath . In particular, @xmath implies @xmath (again by
definition of the bonding maps) and hence @xmath .

For the second case suppose that both @xmath and @xmath are elements of
@xmath , and write @xmath . Let @xmath and @xmath be the partition
classes of @xmath with @xmath and @xmath . Then in particular @xmath is
contained in @xmath and @xmath is contained in @xmath . Since @xmath and
@xmath are disjoint, the ultrafilters @xmath and @xmath are distinct, so
@xmath holds. ∎

###### Claim 4.

@xmath is surjective.

###### Proof of the Claim.

Let any @xmath be given. If @xmath is not an element of @xmath we choose
some @xmath in @xmath such that @xmath is contained in the 1-complex of
@xmath , and let @xmath . Then for every @xmath in @xmath we set @xmath
, and for every @xmath for some such @xmath we put @xmath . Then @xmath
is a well defined element of @xmath which @xmath sends to @xmath .

Otherwise @xmath is in @xmath and of the form @xmath . For every @xmath
the ultrafilter @xmath chooses excatly one partition class @xmath of
@xmath . Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is a well-defined point in @xmath : Assume for a contradiction that
there are some @xmath in @xmath with @xmath incompatible in @xmath in
that @xmath . Write @xmath and @xmath . Then the dummy vertex @xmath
satisfies

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which implies @xmath . Furthermore, using the definition of @xmath
yields

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (3)
  -- -------- -- -----

Since @xmath and @xmath are both in @xmath it suffices to show that
these sets have empty intersection in order to yield a contradiction.
For this, let any @xmath be given. By definition of @xmath there is some
@xmath with @xmath . Hence the component @xmath is not in @xmath , since
otherwise the vertices of @xmath would be contained in the left hand
side of ( 3 ) which is empty, a contradiction. Thus @xmath and @xmath
intersect emptily as desired. ∎

By now we know that @xmath is a bijection. Before we verify that @xmath
is also bicontinuous, let us quickly recall Lemma 2.2.5 : According to
this Lemma, the collection of all open sets of the form @xmath with
@xmath some element of @xmath and @xmath some basic open set in @xmath
is a basis of the topology of @xmath . Now that we know this basis, we
are almost done:

###### Claim 5.

@xmath maps basic open sets of @xmath to basic open sets of @xmath .

###### Proof of the Claim.

Let any point @xmath of @xmath be given together with some basic open
neighbourhood @xmath .

If @xmath is not in @xmath we choose some @xmath in @xmath such that
@xmath is contained in the 1-complex of @xmath , and set @xmath . Then
@xmath is also a basic open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath , so
@xmath holds.

Otherwise @xmath is an element of @xmath , so @xmath is of the form
@xmath for some @xmath and some non-empty @xmath . Let @xmath and
consider the basic open neighbourhood @xmath of the dummy vertex @xmath
in @xmath . Then one easily checks that @xmath holds. ∎

###### Claim 6.

@xmath maps basic open sets of @xmath to open sets of @xmath .

###### Proof of the Claim.

Let any basic open set @xmath of @xmath be given and write @xmath .

If @xmath is a basic open neighbourhood of some non-dummy point of
@xmath , then @xmath is basic open in @xmath .

Otherwise @xmath is of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is some dummy vertex of @xmath , the set @xmath is some
finite subset of @xmath , and for every @xmath the point @xmath is an
arbitrary inner edge point of @xmath while @xmath is the endvertex of
@xmath in @xmath . Let @xmath be the partition class of @xmath with
@xmath . Then

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

which is open since the finitely many intervals @xmath are closed in
@xmath . ∎

This completes the proof that @xmath is a homeomorphism. ∎

From now on we treat @xmath as @xmath .

### 5 A least tangle compactification

We call a compactification @xmath of (the 1-complex of) @xmath an @xmath
-compactification of @xmath if @xmath is also a compactification of
@xmath and @xmath is Hausdorff. Even though we speak of an @xmath
-compactification ‘of’ @xmath , we formally treat it as a
compacitification of @xmath , e.g. if @xmath holds for another @xmath
-compactification @xmath of @xmath , then any witness @xmath of this is
required to fix @xmath as well as @xmath . Whenever @xmath is an @xmath
-compactification of @xmath and @xmath is a singleton, we call @xmath a
one-point @xmath -compactification of @xmath . For every @xmath we
denote by @xmath the map sending each @xmath to the principal
ultrafilter on @xmath generated by @xmath . Furthermore, in this chapter
every @xmath carries the discrete topology.

#### 5.1 Introduction

As the graph depicted in Fig. 3 (p. 3 ) shows, there exist graphs @xmath
for which @xmath is not the coarsest @xmath -compactification: Indeed,
if @xmath is the graph from Fig. 3 , then @xmath has a one-point @xmath
-compactification reflecting the structure of @xmath while @xmath adds
@xmath many ultrafilter tangles to @xmath . But as a @xmath shows, it is
not always possible to just take the one-point @xmath -compactification
of @xmath in order to obtain a strictly coarser ²⁸ ²⁸ 28 By ‘strictly
coarser’ we mean ‘coarser but not topologically equivalent’. @xmath
-compactification than @xmath , since @xmath does not even have a
one-point compactification (see Proposition 5.2.2 for a characterisation
of the graphs @xmath admitting a one-point @xmath -compactification).
Hence Diestel [ 14 ] asked:

1.  For which [graphs] @xmath is @xmath the coarsest [ @xmath
    -]compactification [...]? ²⁹ ²⁹ 29 In his paper, Diestel asked ‘For
    which @xmath is @xmath the coarsest compactification in which its
    ends appear as distinct points?’. In order to obviate coarser
    versions of the topology of @xmath for some special @xmath from
    leading this question ad absurdum, we interpreted it as stated in
    (i).

2.  If it is not, is there a unique such topology [i.e. @xmath
    -compactification],
    and is there a canonical way to obtain it from @xmath ?

In order to tackle these questions, we proceed as follows: In Section
5.3 we construct for arbitrary @xmath an inverse system @xmath of T ₂
-compactifica-
tions @xmath of the @xmath whose inverse limit @xmath we use to obtain
an @xmath -compactification @xmath of @xmath in a similar way Diestel
used @xmath to compactify @xmath . The purpose of @xmath on the one hand
is to serve as a witness when we characterise those graphs @xmath for
which @xmath is not the coarsest @xmath -compactification, and on the
other hand it is our candidate for a positive answer regarding the first
part of the second question. But we should have a closer look at the
second question itself before we consider possible solutions.

Obviously, the second question tacitly assumes that any answer imposes
some further meaningful conditions on the @xmath -compactifications
considered, as the example graph @xmath from Fig. 4 shows.

By Proposition 5.2.2 we know that this graph has a one-point @xmath
-compactification, so @xmath clearly is not the coarsest @xmath
-compactification of @xmath . But from an intuitive point of view, the
one-point @xmath -compactification of @xmath does not reflect the
structure of the graph at all. Instead of one point, three points as
indicated by the grey ovals in the drawing feel far more intuitive.
Indeed, if @xmath is one of @xmath and @xmath , then @xmath splits up
the drawing of the graph into a left hand side and a right hand side,
which together induce a separation @xmath of the graph whose separator
consists precisely of @xmath .

The tangle compactification of @xmath respects @xmath and @xmath in that
every @xmath -tangle lives on precisely one side of each. Since the two
separations are nested, say @xmath as in the drawing, they partition
@xmath into three classes @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . Here, the tangles
in @xmath are those living on the small side of @xmath , the tangles in
@xmath are those living on the big side of @xmath , and the tangles in
@xmath are those living in on the big side of @xmath and on the small
side of @xmath . But @xmath and @xmath are not the only finite order
separations of @xmath with two infinite sides, so @xmath has more than
three @xmath -tangles. Hence our intuition suggests that some finite
order separations reflect the structure of @xmath better than others. So
what makes our two separations so special? The answer is rather simple:
both separations respect the @xmath -classes ³⁰ ³⁰ 30 Recall that the
equivalence relation @xmath was defined on @xmath by letting @xmath
whenever @xmath holds. which turn out to be @xmath , @xmath and @xmath .
Furthermore, we have @xmath , and @xmath gives an indication that these
might be related; but this was to be expected somewhat (in fact, we will
see that the map @xmath defines a bijection between @xmath and @xmath ,
see Corollary 3.3.4 ).

Here, my intuition tells me that it might be worth to have a closer look
at the quotient @xmath . Surprisingly, I did not find graph theoretical
indications substantiating my intuition, let alone graph theoretical
reasons to consider certain @xmath -compactifications of @xmath
revealing @xmath as the coarsest one. That is why I try a more technical
approach for a change. Remember that, on the one hand @xmath is a useful
technical description of @xmath , but on the other hand @xmath can be
understood as a generalisation of @xmath (with the ends viewed as
directions). Therefore, if we manage to abstract the essential ideas
behind the inverse system @xmath generalising @xmath , then this might
lead to meaningful conditions regarding question (ii), and maybe @xmath
turns out to be the coarsest @xmath -compactification satisfying these.

For this, let us take a closer look at how @xmath manages to induce an
@xmath -compactification of @xmath . As is well known, @xmath is the
inverse limit of the inverse system @xmath . Hence, if every @xmath is
finite, then @xmath is compact Hausdorff by Lemma 2.2.3 , and so is
@xmath (Observation 2.5.1 ). But as soon as some @xmath is infinite, the
space @xmath is no longer compact. Let us have a closer look at the
tangle compactification overcoming this hindrance. For every @xmath ,
the pair @xmath is the Stone-Čech Hausdorff compactification of @xmath ,
so @xmath is compact Hausdorff by Lemma 2.2.3 . For @xmath , the space
@xmath being compact in general does not imply that @xmath is compact,
e.g. consider a @xmath . This is because every infinite @xmath gives
rise to a ‘bad’ cover of @xmath consisting of open sets (one that has no
finite subcover). Since every @xmath is compact, this cannot possibly
happen in @xmath . Next, we investigate @xmath . The bonding maps @xmath
of the inverse system @xmath by definition respect the bonding maps
@xmath of the inverse system @xmath in that for all @xmath the diagram

[]

commutes, so as a result @xmath includes a homeomorphic copy of @xmath .
Capturing these properties formally leads us to the notion of a @xmath
-system: A @xmath -system is an inverse system of Hausdorff
compactifications of the @xmath whose bonding maps respect the maps
@xmath , and on the class of all @xmath -systems (for fixed @xmath ) we
define a natural order-relation @xmath . We prove, making use of the
fact that @xmath is the Stone-Čech Hausdorff compactification of @xmath
for every @xmath , that @xmath is the greatest @xmath -system with
respect to @xmath and up to @xmath -equivalence (this will be introduced
formally in Section 5.4 ). Furthermore, every @xmath -system gives rise
to an @xmath -compactification of @xmath in the same way @xmath yields
@xmath . Hence the following two questions arise:

1.  Is there a coarsest @xmath -compactification induced by a least
    @xmath -system?

2.  If there is, can it be used as a witness regarding question (i)?

As our first main result of this chapter, we will show in Theorem 5.4.10
that @xmath is indeed the least @xmath -system (up to @xmath
-equivalence), and @xmath is the coarsest @xmath -compactification of
@xmath induced by a @xmath -system while @xmath is the finest @xmath
-compactification of @xmath induced by a @xmath -system. This settles
question (ii @xmath ).

Furthermore, as our second main result of this chapter, we will show in
Theorem 5.4.11 that @xmath and @xmath are topologically equivalent
@xmath -compactifications if and only if every @xmath is finite. In
particular, @xmath is the coarsest @xmath -compactification of the graph
@xmath if and only if every @xmath is finite (i.e. @xmath coincides with
@xmath ). This settles question (i) and (iii).

In Section 5.5 we show that @xmath is homeomorphic to @xmath (the
quotient we deemed worth a second look earlier) by a homeomorphism
fixing @xmath , and we give a description of @xmath solely in terms of
tangles. Together with the answer of (ii @xmath ) this settles question
(ii).

As it turns out, it is even possible to describe @xmath using @xmath
-tangles, simply by adjusting the underlying separation system (see
Section 5.6 ).

Finally, in Section 5.7 we show that there is an inverse subsystem of
the inverse system @xmath (from Chapter 4 ) whose inverse limit
describes the space @xmath .

#### 5.2 The one-point @xmath-compactification of @xmath

If @xmath is a graph, then @xmath is compact if and only if every @xmath
is finite (Observation 2.5.1 ). Hence @xmath has a trivial @xmath
-compactification if and only if every @xmath is finite. Now if @xmath
is a graph with not all @xmath finite, then @xmath in general does not
have a one-point @xmath -compactification. In this section we
characterise the graphs @xmath admitting a one-point @xmath
-compactification.

Recall that by Theorem 2.4.14 a topological space @xmath has a one-point
Hausdorff compactification if and only if @xmath is locally compact and
Hausdorff, but not compact. We start with a characterisation of the
graphs admitting a locally compact end space:

###### Lemma 5.2.1.

For every graph @xmath the following are equivalent:

1.  @xmath is a locally compact subspace of @xmath .

2.   For every end @xmath of @xmath there is some @xmath such that for
    all @xmath only finitely many components @xmath of @xmath with
    @xmath contain ends of @xmath .

###### Proof.

(i) @xmath (ii). Assume for a contradiction that there is some end
@xmath of @xmath for which (ii) fails. Since @xmath is locally compact,
we find some compact @xmath together with an open neighbourhood @xmath
of @xmath in @xmath such that @xmath . Without loss of generality @xmath
is induced by a basic open neighbourhood @xmath for some @xmath . Since
(ii) fails for @xmath we find some @xmath such that infinitely many
components @xmath of @xmath with @xmath contain at least one end of
@xmath . Then the collection @xmath is an open cover of @xmath which has
no finite subcover of @xmath . In particular, it is an open cover of
@xmath that has no finite subcover, contradicting the compactness of
@xmath .

(ii) @xmath (i). In order to show that @xmath is locally compact, let
@xmath be an end of @xmath . Our task is to find a compact neighbourhood
of @xmath in @xmath . Let @xmath for some @xmath as in (ii), and note
that @xmath is a closed neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath . For every
@xmath let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

carry the discrete topology and note that @xmath is finite and non-empty
by choice of @xmath . Then by Lemma 2.2.3 the inverse system @xmath has
a compact inverse limit @xmath whose elements extend precisely to the
ends of @xmath in @xmath . In particular, it is easy to see that @xmath
and @xmath are even homeomorphic, so @xmath is compact as desired. ∎

As the following example shows, a locally compact end space in general
does not suffice to ensure the existence of a one-point @xmath
-compactification of @xmath : indeed, if @xmath is the graph depicted in
Fig. 32 , then @xmath obviously is not compact, and every open
neighbourhood of the sole end of the graph includes a copy of @xmath .
Hence @xmath and @xmath are not locally compact at the sole end of the
graph, so @xmath has no one-point Hausdorff compactification by Theorem
2.4.14 .

###### Proposition 5.2.2.

For every graph @xmath the following are equivalent:

1.  @xmath has a one-point @xmath -compactification.

2.   There is some @xmath with @xmath infinite and for every end @xmath
    of @xmath there is some @xmath such that for all @xmath the set
    @xmath is finite.

###### Proof.

(i) @xmath (ii). If @xmath is a one-point @xmath -compactification of
@xmath , then @xmath is a one-point Hausdorff compactification of @xmath
. It follows from Theorem 2.4.14 that @xmath is locally compact but not
compact, so Observation 2.5.1 implies that there is some @xmath with
@xmath infinite. Now assume for a contradiction that there is some
@xmath not satisfying the condition from (ii). Since @xmath is locally
compact, we find a compact neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in @xmath .
Pick a basic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in @xmath with @xmath .
Since (ii) fails, there is some @xmath with @xmath infinite. Then the
collection

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is a cover of @xmath of open sets which has no finite subcover of @xmath
, contradicting the compactness of @xmath .

(ii) @xmath (i). Since there is some @xmath with @xmath infinite, we
know that @xmath is not compact. Let @xmath be a point that is not in
@xmath , and extend @xmath to a topological space @xmath by declaring as
open for every @xmath and @xmath the set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

whenever @xmath is cofinite in @xmath and the set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is included in @xmath , and taking on @xmath the topology this
generates. To see that this yields a topology, it suffices to show that
for every two open neighbourhoods @xmath and @xmath of @xmath there is
some open neighbourhood of @xmath included in their intersection. Due to
@xmath we know that @xmath is cofinite in @xmath . Furthermore, @xmath
follows from @xmath and the choice of @xmath . Similarly, @xmath is
cofinite in @xmath and @xmath , so

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

holds as desired. Clearly, @xmath is a dense subspace of @xmath .
Furthermore, @xmath is Hausdorff: For this, let @xmath be an end of
@xmath , and pick @xmath as in (ii). Then @xmath and @xmath are disjoint
open neighbourhoods of @xmath and @xmath , respectively. For other
points this is clear, so @xmath is Hausdorff as claimed. It remains to
show that @xmath is compact. For this, let @xmath be an arbitrary open
neighbourhood of @xmath . It suffices to show that @xmath is compact.
Let @xmath . Clearly, @xmath is homeomorphic to @xmath , so it suffices
to show that @xmath is compact. Since @xmath is included in @xmath and
@xmath is finite, for every @xmath the set @xmath is also finite. Hence
@xmath is compact by Observation 2.5.1 as desired. ∎

#### 5.3 An inverse limit of Hausdorff compactifications

In order to create a coarser @xmath -compactification than @xmath , we
create an inverse system @xmath of Hausdorff compactifications @xmath of
the @xmath , which we then use to obtain an @xmath -compactification
@xmath of @xmath .

If @xmath is a set, then we denote by @xmath the cofinite filter on
@xmath . Recall that for two sets @xmath with @xmath we denote by @xmath
the collection of all supersets @xmath of elements of @xmath , and we
call @xmath the set-theoretic up-closure of @xmath in @xmath . Now we
start the construction: For every @xmath and every @xmath let @xmath be
the set-theoretic up-closure of @xmath in @xmath , i.e.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In particular, @xmath is again a filter on @xmath . Recall that, for
every @xmath , we chose @xmath to be the function with domain @xmath
which sends every @xmath to the principal ultrafilter on @xmath
generated by @xmath . Write

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

We endow the spaces @xmath with the standard topology whose basic open
sets are of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

one for each @xmath . This topology has a basis which suits our needs
far better: For every @xmath let @xmath be the collection of all
singleton subsets of @xmath and all sets @xmath which are cofinite in
@xmath for some @xmath . Let @xmath be the collection of all sets @xmath
with @xmath . Then

###### Lemma 5.3.1.

@xmath is a basis for the topology of @xmath .

###### Proof.

Given @xmath and @xmath with @xmath we have to find some @xmath with
@xmath . If @xmath holds for some @xmath , then we may choose @xmath as
@xmath . Otherwise @xmath is of the form @xmath for some @xmath . Then
@xmath implies that @xmath is cofinite in @xmath , so we may pick @xmath
. ∎

Whenever we speak of a basic open neighbourhood of some element of
@xmath , we mean ‘basic’ with respect to @xmath .

The @xmath compactify the @xmath as promised:

###### Lemma 5.3.2.

@xmath is a Hausdorff compactification of @xmath , for every @xmath .

###### Proof.

Since we equipped @xmath with the discrete topology and @xmath also
induces the discrete topology on @xmath , the map @xmath clearly is an
embedding. Clearly, @xmath is dense in @xmath , and @xmath is Hausdorff
since for every two distinct @xmath and @xmath in @xmath we have @xmath
. Finally we show that @xmath is compact: Let @xmath be any cover of
@xmath by open sets @xmath . For every @xmath pick some @xmath such that
@xmath and note that @xmath is finite. Hence @xmath is finite, and we
are done. ∎

###### Lemma 5.3.3.

The spaces @xmath are totally disconnected.

###### Proof.

Let @xmath be a subset of @xmath with @xmath . Pick two distinct
elements @xmath and @xmath of @xmath . If one of @xmath and @xmath is
principal, say @xmath for some @xmath , the open sets @xmath and @xmath
induce an open bipartition of @xmath . Otherwise we find distinct
elements @xmath and @xmath of @xmath with @xmath and @xmath . Then the
open sets @xmath and @xmath induce an open bipartition of @xmath . ∎

In order to obtain an inverse system @xmath from the spaces @xmath we
define compatible bonding maps @xmath for all @xmath as follows: Let
@xmath be given.

Suppose first that @xmath is of the form @xmath for some @xmath . Then
we put @xmath , i.e. @xmath where @xmath is the unique component of
@xmath including @xmath .

For the second case suppose that @xmath is of the form @xmath for some
@xmath . If @xmath holds, then we also have @xmath witnessed by @xmath ,
so we may put @xmath . Otherwise @xmath implies that there is some
unique component @xmath of @xmath including @xmath since every vertex in
@xmath has a neighbour in each element of @xmath , so we put @xmath .
This completes the definition of the bonding maps. It remains to show
that they are continuous:

###### Lemma 5.3.4.

The bonding maps @xmath are continuous.

###### Proof.

Let @xmath be given together with some basic open neighbourhood @xmath
of @xmath .

Suppose first that @xmath is of the form @xmath for some @xmath , and
hence @xmath is of the form @xmath for @xmath . Then @xmath is an open
neighbourhood of @xmath which @xmath maps to @xmath .

For the second case suppose that @xmath for some @xmath . If @xmath then
there exists a unique component @xmath of @xmath including @xmath , so
@xmath is of the form @xmath . In particular, @xmath is an open
neighbourhood of @xmath which @xmath maps to @xmath . Otherwise @xmath
holds, then we have @xmath and moreover @xmath is a cofinite subset of
@xmath since @xmath is basic open. In particular, @xmath is a cofinite
subset of @xmath with @xmath . Hence @xmath is an open neighbourhood of
@xmath which @xmath maps into @xmath . ∎

Therefore, @xmath is an inverse system, and we write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proposition 5.3.5.

The topological space @xmath is compact, Hausdorff and totally
disconnected.

###### Proof.

According to Lemmas 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 the topological spaces @xmath are
compact, Hausdorff and totally disconnected. By Lemma 2.2.2 , so is
@xmath . ∎

Analogously to [ 14 , Lemma 3.2] , we note a very useful fact:

###### Lemma 5.3.6.

For all @xmath the map @xmath restricts to a bijection between @xmath
and @xmath with inverse @xmath .∎

###### Corollary 5.3.7.

For every @xmath , each @xmath uniquely extends to an element of @xmath
.∎

For every @xmath let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

i.e. @xmath is in @xmath if and only if there is some @xmath with @xmath
. The following is immediate from Lemma 5.3.6 and Corollary 5.3.7 :

###### Proposition 5.3.8.

If @xmath is not in @xmath , then the set @xmath has a least element
@xmath such that @xmath . The set @xmath determines @xmath , and @xmath
holds for every @xmath . Furthermore, for every @xmath there is a unique
@xmath with @xmath . This defines a bijection @xmath .∎

Finally, we use @xmath to compactifiy @xmath in the same way Diestel
used @xmath to compactify @xmath . For this, let @xmath send each @xmath
to @xmath , i.e. @xmath is the restriction of the @xmath th projection
map @xmath to @xmath . By Lemma 2.2.5 and Lemma 5.3.1 , the collection
of all sets of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath and @xmath forms a basis for the topology of @xmath . Now
consider the 1-complex of @xmath and extend its topology to the
topological space

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

by declaring as open, for every @xmath and @xmath , the set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and taking the topology on @xmath this generates. Here, the graph @xmath
carries the 1-complex topology. Note that the subspace topology on
@xmath is our original topology on @xmath . Let @xmath denote the basis
we used for @xmath . That @xmath is indeed an @xmath -compactification
of @xmath will follow from the more general Theorems 5.4.1 and 5.4.2 .

#### 5.4 @xmath-compactifications induced by @xmath-systems

In this section we study @xmath -systems which generalise the known
concepts of directions and the inverse systems @xmath and @xmath from
the previous section. Furthermore, we study @xmath -compactifications
induced by @xmath -systems in order to answer questions (i) and (ii
@xmath ) from the introduction of this chapter.

Fix any infinite graph @xmath . For every @xmath denote by @xmath the
set of all components of @xmath whose neighbourhood is not in @xmath ,
i.e.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and note that this set must be finite due to pigeonhole principle. If
@xmath is a Hausdorff compactification of @xmath for every @xmath and
@xmath is an inverse system whose bonding maps respect the maps @xmath
in that

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (4)
  -- -------- -- -----

holds for all @xmath , i.e. the diagram

[]

commutes, then we call @xmath a @xmath - system (of @xmath ). Note that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is a @xmath -system by Lemmas 5.3.2 and 5.3.4 , and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is a @xmath -system, too. If every @xmath is finite, then @xmath is a
@xmath -system, too. As our first main result of this section, we
generalise Diestel’s construction of the tangle compactification and
show that every @xmath -system gives rise to an @xmath -compactification
of the graph @xmath :

If @xmath is a @xmath -system, put @xmath and for every @xmath let
@xmath be the restriction of the @xmath th projection map @xmath .
Clearly, @xmath is continuous. If clear from context, we write @xmath
instead of @xmath . Now we extend @xmath (viewed as 1-complex) to a
topological space @xmath by declaring as open, for all @xmath and every
open set @xmath of @xmath , the set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath , and taking the topology on @xmath this generates.

###### Theorem 5.4.1.

If @xmath is any infinite graph, then @xmath is an @xmath
-compactification of @xmath . In particular, so are @xmath and @xmath .

###### Proof.

First, we show that @xmath is dense in @xmath . Every open neighbourhood
of an element of @xmath is of the form @xmath . Since @xmath is a dense
subset of @xmath , we know that @xmath meets @xmath , and hence @xmath
meets @xmath . In particular, @xmath meets @xmath , so @xmath is dense
in @xmath .

Next, we show that @xmath is compact. For this, we mimic the proof of [
14 , Theorem 1 (i)] , replacing [ 14 , Lemmas 2.3 and 3.7] by
topological arguments. Hence consider any cover @xmath of @xmath by open
sets @xmath . Since the subspace topology of @xmath is the original
topology of @xmath and @xmath is compact by Lemma 2.2.3 , the cover
@xmath has a finite subset of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

(with @xmath finite) that covers @xmath . Our aim is to show that @xmath
is the 1-complex of a finite graph: then @xmath will be compact as
desired. For this, put @xmath , and for each @xmath let @xmath be the
open set @xmath of @xmath . We claim that for each @xmath the inclusion

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (5)
  -- -------- -- -----

holds: Indeed,

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (6)
  -- -------- -- -----

holds by choice of @xmath and since the diagram

[]

commutes. According to the definitions of @xmath and @xmath , and due to
@xmath , it remains to show that @xmath holds. Using ( 4 ), this is
easily calculated:

  -- -------- -------- --
              @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Hence ( 5 ) holds as claimed, and the sets @xmath still cover @xmath
by ( 6 ). Now consider the set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If @xmath is finite, then so is @xmath , and we are done. Hence we
assume for a contradiction that @xmath is infinite. Consider the closed
set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and for every @xmath set @xmath . In particular, every @xmath is closed
in @xmath , and hence compact. Furthermore, since @xmath is infinite,
each @xmath is non-empty. Together with @xmath and ( 4 ), this implies
that every @xmath is non-empty. By Lemma 2.2.3 we find an element in the
inverse limit of the inverse system @xmath , which is easily extended to
an element @xmath of @xmath since @xmath is cofinal in @xmath . In
particular, @xmath is a contradiction. Thus @xmath is compact, so in
particular @xmath is a compactification of (the 1-complex of) @xmath .

Since @xmath is also Hausdorff by Lemma 2.2.3 , it is easy to see that
so is @xmath . It remains to show that @xmath is a compactification of
@xmath . We have already seen that @xmath is compact and @xmath is dense
in @xmath . By ( 4 ) and abuse of notation we may assume @xmath . Hence
it suffices to show that @xmath induces the right subspace topology on
@xmath . For every @xmath and @xmath the open neighbourhood @xmath of
@xmath in @xmath induces on @xmath the basic open neighbourhood @xmath
of @xmath . Conversely, it is easy to see that every open set @xmath of
@xmath induces on @xmath a set that is also open in @xmath . Therefore,
@xmath is a subspace of @xmath . ∎

In particular, we obtain the following analogue of [ 14 , Theorem 1] for
@xmath :

###### Theorem 5.4.2.

Let @xmath be any graph.

1.  @xmath is an @xmath -compactification of @xmath and @xmath is
    totally disconnected.

2.   If @xmath is locally finite and connected, then @xmath holds and
    @xmath coincides with the Freudenthal compactification of @xmath .

###### Proof.

(i) By Theorem 5.4.1 we know that @xmath is an @xmath -compactification
of @xmath , and @xmath is totally disconnected by Proposition 5.3.5 .

(ii) If @xmath is locally finite, then @xmath is empty, so @xmath holds.
∎

In order to compare @xmath -systems, we introduce the following notion:
If @xmath and @xmath are two @xmath -systems we write @xmath whenever
@xmath holds for every @xmath (witnessed by unique @xmath , see Lemma
2.4.12 ) and

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (7)
  -- -------- -- -----

holds for all @xmath . Condition ( 7 ) together with condition ( 4 )
ensures that the diagram

[]

commutes for all @xmath , so that the mapping

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- -----
     @xmath            @xmath   @xmath      (8)
              @xmath   @xmath               
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- -----

is a well-defined continuous surjection by Lemma 2.2.7 . Furthermore,
this yields

###### Lemma 5.4.3.

If @xmath and @xmath are two @xmath -systems with @xmath and @xmath
induces the @xmath -compactification @xmath of @xmath whereas @xmath
induces the @xmath -compactification @xmath of @xmath , then @xmath is
witnessed by @xmath .

###### Proof.

Put @xmath . By ( 4 ) we know that @xmath fixes @xmath (by abuse of
notation). Clearly, it suffices to show that @xmath is continuous at
every @xmath (recall that @xmath ). For this, consider any basic open
neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in @xmath , and recall that @xmath is
open in @xmath . By definition of @xmath we have @xmath . Since @xmath
is continuous, we find some open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in
@xmath with @xmath . Then @xmath is an open neighbourhood of @xmath in
@xmath . Hence it suffices to show that @xmath maps it to @xmath . By
choice of @xmath and definition of @xmath we know that @xmath sends the
open subset @xmath of @xmath to the open subset @xmath of @xmath , so by
definition of @xmath and @xmath is suffices to show @xmath . But this is
clear from @xmath combined with the commuting diagram

[]

(recall that it commutes since @xmath witnesses @xmath ). ∎

If both @xmath and @xmath hold, we say that @xmath and @xmath are @xmath
- equivalent . The following lemma and corollary indicate that this
definition is meaningful:

###### Lemma 5.4.4.

Let @xmath and @xmath be two @xmath -systems with @xmath and @xmath .
For every @xmath suppose that

1.  @xmath witnesses @xmath , and

2.  @xmath witnesses @xmath .

Let @xmath be as in ( 8 ), and let @xmath be defined analogously using
the @xmath instead of the @xmath . Then @xmath is a homeomorphism with
inverse @xmath .

###### Proof.

For every @xmath Lemma 2.4.10 yields that @xmath is a homeomorphism, and
by Lemma 2.4.12 we know that @xmath must be its inverse. In particular,
every @xmath is injective, and so must be @xmath . Furthermore, we
already know that @xmath is also a continuous surjection. Similarly,
@xmath is a continuous bijection, and @xmath is its continuous inverse.
∎

###### Corollary 5.4.5.

Let @xmath and @xmath be two @xmath -equivalent @xmath -systems. Let
@xmath and @xmath be the two @xmath -compactifications of @xmath induced
by @xmath and @xmath , respectively. Then @xmath and @xmath are
topologically equivalent, witnessed by the homeomorphism @xmath with
inverse @xmath .

###### Proof.

Combine Lemmas 5.4.4 and 5.4.3 . ∎

At first glance condition ( 7 ) complicates the definition of @xmath for
@xmath -systems a lot, giving us a hard time working with it.
Surprisingly, the following Lemma takes this extra work load off our
shoulders:

###### Lemma 5.4.6.

Suppose that @xmath and @xmath are two @xmath -systems with @xmath
(witnessed by @xmath ) for all @xmath . Then ( 7 ) holds for all @xmath
.

###### Proof.

Recall that for every @xmath the witness @xmath satisfies @xmath . Hence
for every @xmath we compute:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Thus both sides of ( 7 ) agree on @xmath , so by Lemma 2.4.4 they agree
on all of @xmath as desired. ∎

###### Theorem 5.4.7.

If @xmath is an infinite graph, then the following hold:

1.   For every @xmath we have @xmath .

2.  @xmath .

3.  @xmath .

###### Proof.

(i). This is immediate from Lemma 2.4.15 . For further insight, a
constructive proof follows:

Let any @xmath be given and define @xmath as follows: If @xmath is
principal we set @xmath . Otherwise @xmath is non-principal, so @xmath
holds for exactly one @xmath due to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and since @xmath is finite. Hence, we set @xmath .

It remains to verify that @xmath is continuous: For this, consider any
@xmath together with some basic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in
@xmath . If @xmath is generated by some @xmath with @xmath , then @xmath
is a basic open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath which @xmath maps to
@xmath . Otherwise @xmath is non-principal there is some @xmath with
@xmath and @xmath is a cofinite subset of @xmath , so @xmath maps @xmath
to @xmath as desired. Thus @xmath is continuous as desired.

(ii) is immediate from (i) and Lemma 5.4.6 .

(iii) is immediate from (ii) and Lemma 5.4.3 . ∎

Next, we prove two technical Lemmas, which we then combine in Theorem
5.4.10 in order to show that @xmath is the least @xmath -system (with
respect to @xmath ).

###### Lemma 5.4.8.

Let @xmath be given together with a compactification @xmath of @xmath
and suppose that

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (9)
  -- -------- -- -----

holds for all @xmath . Then @xmath .

###### Proof.

To construct a witness @xmath of @xmath , we proceed as follows:

First, we write @xmath (recall that @xmath is the set of all components
of @xmath whose neighbourhood is not in @xmath ), and for every @xmath
we put

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is a finite partition of @xmath into closed—and hence clopen—subsets.
Similarly, we write @xmath , and for every @xmath we set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with the closure taken in @xmath . Since @xmath is finite and @xmath is
Hausdorff, we know that @xmath is closed in @xmath . Hence ( 9 ) yields
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is a finite partition of @xmath into closed—and hence clopen—subsets.

Next, we define mappings whose union we will take as @xmath in the end.
Let @xmath map @xmath to @xmath for each @xmath , and note that @xmath
is continuous since @xmath carries the discrete subspace topology. Since
for every @xmath the pair @xmath is the one-point Hausdorff
compactification of @xmath (equipped with the discrete subspace topology
inherited from @xmath ) and @xmath is a Hausdorff compactification of
@xmath , by Lemma 2.4.13 we have

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (10)
  -- -------- -- ------

witnessed by some @xmath . Since @xmath carries the subspace topology of
@xmath , we may widen the codomain of @xmath to @xmath without losing
continuity. Finally, we take @xmath to be the union of @xmath and the
all of the @xmath . By Lemma 2.4.5 we know that @xmath is continuous. ∎

###### Lemma 5.4.9.

Let @xmath be a @xmath -system and let @xmath be such that @xmath holds
for all @xmath . Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

holds for all @xmath .

###### Proof.

Assume for a contradiction that there is a pair @xmath with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then one of @xmath and @xmath is non-empty, so without loss of
generality we find some @xmath . Set @xmath . Then @xmath holds by
assumption, witnessed by some @xmath . By choice of @xmath and @xmath we
may pick some @xmath (with the closure taken in @xmath ). Now put @xmath
. Since @xmath is continuous, Lemma 2.4.2 implies

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

(with the closures taken in @xmath ). Using ( 4 ) yields

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (11)
  -- -------- -- ------

By choice of @xmath and @xmath there exists a unique component @xmath of
@xmath including @xmath , i.e. with @xmath . Furthermore, @xmath implies
@xmath . Hence, combining ( 11 ) with @xmath yields

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

But then @xmath implies @xmath since @xmath is Hausdorff. Recall that
@xmath is an isolated point of @xmath , witnessed by the open
neighbourhood @xmath . Put @xmath and note that this is open in @xmath
since @xmath is continuous. Moreover, @xmath together with Lemma 2.4.11
(i) and (ii) yields @xmath . In particular, @xmath is also isolated in
@xmath , witnessed by @xmath . Due to @xmath we have @xmath , and
furthermore @xmath yields @xmath (recall @xmath ). Hence @xmath follows.
Moreover, since @xmath is isolated in @xmath , we even have @xmath ,
witnessed by @xmath , contradicting our choice of @xmath as desired. ∎

###### Theorem 5.4.10.

For every infinite @xmath the following hold up to @xmath -/topological
equivalence:

1.  @xmath is the least @xmath -system (with respect to @xmath ).

2.  @xmath is the greatest @xmath -system (with respect to @xmath ).

3.  @xmath is the coarsest @xmath -compactification of @xmath induced by
    a @xmath -system.

4.  @xmath is the finest @xmath -compactification of @xmath induced by a
    @xmath -system.

###### Proof.

(i). Assume for a contradiction that there is another @xmath -system
@xmath with @xmath . Write @xmath . Due to Lemma 5.4.6 we find some
minimal @xmath with @xmath . By Lemma 5.4.8 there exist @xmath in @xmath
with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

contradicting Lemma 5.4.9 by choice of @xmath .

(ii). Let @xmath be any @xmath -system. Since @xmath is the Stone-Čech
Hausdorff compactification of @xmath for every @xmath , Lemma 2.4.15
yields @xmath for every @xmath . Thus Lemma 5.4.6 implies @xmath .

(iii) and (iv) are immediate from Lemma 5.4.3 combined with (i) and
(ii), respectively. ∎

Since we now know that @xmath is the coarsest @xmath -compactification
of @xmath induced by a @xmath -system while @xmath is the finest one,
the question for a characterisation of those graphs with @xmath and
@xmath being topologically equivalent immediately comes to mind.

###### Theorem 5.4.11.

For every infinite @xmath the following are equivalent:

1.   The @xmath -compactifications @xmath and @xmath of @xmath are
    topologically equivalent.

2.  @xmath and @xmath are @xmath -equivalent.

3.   Every @xmath is finite.

4.  @xmath .

###### Proof.

Both (iv) @xmath (iii) and (iii) @xmath (ii) are clear, whereas (ii)
@xmath (i) holds by Corollary 5.4.5 . Hence it suffices to show (i)
@xmath (iii).

(i) @xmath (iii). Assume for a contradicting that (iii) fails, witnessed
by some @xmath with @xmath infinite. Then @xmath is finite while @xmath
is infinite, so @xmath is impossible. Let @xmath be a homeomorphism
witnessing (i). To yield a contradiction, we will use @xmath to find a
witness of @xmath .

For every @xmath let @xmath be a witness of @xmath (which exists by
Theorem 5.4.7 ). Furthermore, let @xmath be obtained from the @xmath as
in ( 8 ), i.e. by setting

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for every @xmath , and recall that this is a well-defined continuous
surjection by Lemma 5.4.6 . By Lemma 5.4.3 , the map @xmath witnesses
@xmath . In particular, @xmath witnesses @xmath . Since so does @xmath ,
Lemma 2.4.12 yields @xmath . In particular, @xmath is bijective.

Put @xmath and note @xmath by Lemma 2.4.11 . Next, we use the
injectivity of @xmath to yield that @xmath is injective. Assume for a
contradiction that @xmath is not injective, so there exist @xmath in
@xmath with @xmath for some @xmath . By Corollary 2.3.2 , both @xmath
and @xmath uniquely extend to elements @xmath and @xmath of @xmath ,
respectively. By Corollary 5.3.7 , @xmath uniquely extends to an element
@xmath of @xmath . Since @xmath is unique, every other @xmath satisfies
@xmath . Thus @xmath combined with the definition of @xmath forces
@xmath and @xmath , contradicting the injectivity of @xmath . Hence
@xmath is injective as claimed.

Together with @xmath this yields that @xmath is injective. Since @xmath
is also a continuous surjection by Lemma 2.4.11 , and both @xmath and
@xmath are compact Hausdorff, it follows from general topology that
@xmath is a homeomorphism. In particular, the inverse of @xmath
witnesses @xmath , the desired contradiction. ∎

#### 5.5 A natural quotient of the tangle compactification

In this section, we show that @xmath is homeomorphic to the quotient
space @xmath , but first we describe @xmath in terms of tangles.

Recall that we defined the equivalence relation @xmath on @xmath by
letting @xmath whenever @xmath holds. Via the natural correspondence
between @xmath and @xmath , this induces an equivalence relation @xmath
on @xmath (here we distinguish between elements of @xmath and elements
of @xmath ). Since @xmath originally only served as a technical tool to
help us better understand the ultrafilter tangles, we wish to be able to
describe the @xmath -classes in terms of tangles. For this, we
investigate the following natural class of stars: For every @xmath and
@xmath define

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and put

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Next, we will use these stars to describe @xmath (for @xmath ) in terms
of tangles:

###### Lemma 5.5.1.

For every @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In particular, @xmath is the unique minimal @xmath with @xmath .

###### Proof.

It suffices to show @xmath .

For the forward inclusion let any @xmath with @xmath be given. Then
@xmath is non-principal: Otherwise @xmath is generated by some @xmath
with @xmath , so @xmath implies @xmath , and hence @xmath is a
contradiction. Therefore, @xmath implies @xmath .

For the backward inclusion let any @xmath be given. Since @xmath is
non-principal, we know that @xmath holds for every @xmath . In
particular we have @xmath for every @xmath , and therefore @xmath holds
as desired. ∎

Thus @xmath can be described solely in terms of tangles, as desired.
Next, we compute loads of technical Lemmas leading to an explicit
description of a basis of the quotient topology of @xmath .

Let @xmath be any graph. Define @xmath by setting @xmath and letting
@xmath map each @xmath to @xmath (where @xmath is as in Proposition
5.3.8 )

###### Proposition 5.5.2.

The map @xmath is a well defined bijection between @xmath and @xmath .

###### Proof.

The map @xmath is well defined by Lemma 3.3.2 . Clearly, it suffices to
show that @xmath is bijective, which is the case by Proposition 5.3.8
and Corollary 3.3.4 . ∎

###### Lemma 5.5.3.

For every @xmath and @xmath with @xmath there is a unique component
@xmath of @xmath with @xmath and @xmath .

###### Proof.

By Lemma 3.3.6 the set @xmath meets at most one component of @xmath .
Since @xmath holds, @xmath meets exactly one component @xmath of @xmath
. Set @xmath . Then by Lemma 3.3.2 , @xmath is in @xmath and @xmath is
in @xmath . Hence @xmath is in @xmath , so @xmath holds. ∎

###### Lemma 5.5.4.

For every @xmath and @xmath the set @xmath is closed under the
equivalence relation @xmath .

###### Proof.

Let any @xmath be given together with some @xmath . In particular @xmath
holds, so by Lemma 5.5.3 there exist for both @xmath and @xmath unique
components @xmath and @xmath of @xmath , respectively, with @xmath and
@xmath as well as @xmath and @xmath . Since @xmath meets both @xmath and
@xmath , the uniqueness of @xmath implies @xmath . Furthermore @xmath
follows since otherwise @xmath and @xmath would be disjoint elements of
@xmath , which is impossible. Hence @xmath holds. ∎

###### Lemma 5.5.5.

Let @xmath , @xmath and @xmath be given. Furthermore, suppose that
@xmath is cofinite in @xmath with @xmath . Then we have @xmath .

###### Proof.

Assume for a contradiction that @xmath is distinct from @xmath . By
Lemma 3.3.2 we have @xmath . Now @xmath implies that @xmath is disjoint
from @xmath , and hence from @xmath , a contradiction. ∎

###### Lemma 5.5.6.

For all @xmath , every @xmath and each cofinite subset @xmath of @xmath
the set @xmath is closed under @xmath .

###### Proof.

Put @xmath . First, we show that @xmath is closed under @xmath . For
this, let any @xmath be given together with any @xmath .

If @xmath holds, then @xmath is generated by some @xmath with @xmath a
component of @xmath , and @xmath implies @xmath . In particular we have
@xmath , so Lemma 5.5.4 implies @xmath and we are done.

Otherwise @xmath holds, so @xmath together with Lemma 5.5.5 implies
@xmath . Hence @xmath follows from Lemma 3.3.2 and @xmath . Therefore,
@xmath is closed under @xmath .

Since @xmath is cofinite in @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which is closed under @xmath since @xmath is closed under @xmath and the
@xmath are also closed under @xmath by Lemma 5.5.4 . ∎

###### Lemma 5.5.7.

For every @xmath the set @xmath is closed in @xmath . In particular,
@xmath is a compact subset of @xmath .

###### Proof.

Clearly, the closure of @xmath avoids @xmath . It remains to show that
no @xmath lies in the closure of @xmath . If we have @xmath , then
@xmath avoids @xmath since for every @xmath the ultrafilter @xmath is
non-principal. Otherwise we have @xmath , so @xmath with @xmath avoids
@xmath since @xmath and @xmath are disjoint due to @xmath . Thus @xmath
is a closed subset of the compact space @xmath and hence also compact. ∎

Let @xmath be the collection of all basic open sets of the 1-complex
topology of @xmath , all sets @xmath with @xmath and @xmath , and all
sets @xmath with @xmath and @xmath cofinite in @xmath for some @xmath .

###### Proposition 5.5.8.

The collection @xmath is a basis for the topology of @xmath .

###### Proof.

By Lemmas 5.5.4 and 5.5.6 , the elements of @xmath are open in @xmath .

Let @xmath be any point of @xmath together with some arbitrary open
neighbourhood @xmath . Our task is to find an element @xmath of @xmath
with @xmath .

If @xmath is a vertex or an inner edge point, we are done. Else if
@xmath is an end, we write @xmath and pick a basic open neighbourhood
@xmath of @xmath in @xmath which is included in @xmath . Then we are
done by taking @xmath .

Finally suppose that there is some @xmath with @xmath . For every @xmath
we pick some basic open neighbourhood @xmath in @xmath which is included
in @xmath .

If @xmath holds for some @xmath we put @xmath . Then by Lemma 5.5.3
there is some unique component @xmath of @xmath with @xmath and @xmath
is generated by @xmath . Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is a basic open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath which is closed under
@xmath by Lemma 5.5.4 and included in @xmath . In particular, @xmath is
an open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath which is an element of @xmath
and a subset of @xmath , so we are done.

Hence we may assume that @xmath holds for all @xmath . Since the @xmath
form an open cover in @xmath of the set @xmath which is compact by Lemma
5.5.7 , we find some finite subset @xmath of @xmath such that the @xmath
cover @xmath . Next we put @xmath and note that @xmath holds.
Furthermore, we set @xmath , and for all @xmath we put @xmath . Letting
@xmath , our hope is that @xmath is a suitable candidate for @xmath .

We claim that @xmath is a cofinite subset of @xmath . Assume not for a
contradiction, so @xmath is infinite and by Lemma 3.3.3 we find some
@xmath with @xmath . But then there is some @xmath with @xmath , so in
particular @xmath holds. Since @xmath meets only finitely many elements
of @xmath , the set @xmath is a cofinite subset of @xmath , so in
particular @xmath is in @xmath . Furthermore, @xmath implies @xmath by
definition of @xmath . This contradicts @xmath since @xmath and @xmath
are disjoint. Therefore @xmath is finite as claimed, so by Lemma 5.5.6
the set @xmath is @xmath -closed.

Furthermore, every @xmath is contained in @xmath since @xmath is
cofinite in @xmath and @xmath is in @xmath by Lemma 3.3.2 .

It remains to show that @xmath is included in @xmath . Since @xmath is
the finite union of the sets @xmath , it follows that @xmath is the
finite union of the sets @xmath . Hence it suffices to verify that
@xmath holds for all @xmath . For this, we observe that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

holds for all @xmath . Then Lemma 2.3.4 together with @xmath implies

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

as desired. ∎

Now that we know a basis of the topology of @xmath , only two technical
Lemmas stand in between of us and our desired result, namely that @xmath
induces a homeomorphism @xmath between @xmath and @xmath .

###### Lemma 5.5.9.

For every @xmath and @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

By Lemma 5.5.4 the set @xmath is @xmath -closed, and so is @xmath .

We start with the forward inclusion. If @xmath is any element of @xmath
, then clearly @xmath is contained in @xmath . Else if @xmath is any
element of @xmath , then the ultrafilter @xmath is generated by @xmath
and @xmath must hold. Furthermore, Lemma 5.5.3 implies @xmath . Hence
for @xmath we have @xmath . Let @xmath be the element of @xmath to which
@xmath sends @xmath . In particular, @xmath holds and furthermore @xmath
is generated by @xmath where @xmath is the unique component of @xmath
including @xmath . In particular, @xmath must hold, so @xmath is an
element of @xmath as desired.

Finally, we show the backward inclusion. For this, let any element
@xmath of @xmath be given, and let @xmath be the element of @xmath which
@xmath sends to @xmath . If @xmath is an end we are done, so suppose
that @xmath is of the form @xmath for some @xmath . Since @xmath is
generated by @xmath we have @xmath by definition of @xmath . By Lemma
5.5.3 there exists a unique component @xmath of @xmath with @xmath and
@xmath . By the forward inclusion we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so @xmath implies @xmath . Hence @xmath holds as desired. ∎

###### Lemma 5.5.10.

For all @xmath , every @xmath and each cofinite subset @xmath of @xmath
we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

By Lemma 5.5.6 the set @xmath is @xmath -closed.

We start with the forward inclusion. If @xmath is any element of @xmath
, then clearly @xmath is contained in @xmath . If @xmath is any element
of @xmath we consider two cases. First suppose that @xmath holds. Then
@xmath is generated by @xmath for some @xmath . In particular, @xmath is
contained in @xmath , so @xmath maps @xmath to an element of @xmath by
Lemma 5.5.9 as desired. Second suppose that @xmath holds. Then @xmath
and @xmath being a cofinite subset of @xmath implies @xmath by Lemma
5.5.5 . Let @xmath be the element of @xmath to which @xmath sends @xmath
. Then @xmath holds by definition of @xmath . In particular, @xmath
being a cofinite subset of @xmath implies @xmath , resulting in @xmath
as desired.

Finally, we show the backward inclusion. For this, let any element
@xmath of @xmath be given, and let @xmath be the element of @xmath which
@xmath sends to @xmath . If @xmath is an end we are done, so suppose
that @xmath is of the form @xmath for some @xmath . If @xmath is
generated by @xmath for some @xmath then @xmath is in @xmath and by
Lemma 5.5.9 we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

as desired. Otherwise @xmath is the only possibility for @xmath , so by
definition of @xmath we have @xmath . Furthermore, Lemma 3.3.2 implies
@xmath . Since @xmath is non-principal due to @xmath , the fact that
@xmath is a cofinite subset of @xmath implies @xmath . Hence @xmath is
contained in @xmath , so @xmath is in @xmath as desired. ∎

###### Theorem 5.5.11.

For every graph @xmath combining the bijection @xmath with the identity
on @xmath yields a homeomorphism between @xmath and @xmath .

###### Proof.

Set @xmath which is a bijection by Proposition 5.5.2 . By Proposition
5.5.8 we may consider the basis @xmath for the quotient topology of
@xmath , and we consider the basis @xmath for the topology of @xmath
(recall that @xmath simply is the basis we defined to generate the
topology of @xmath ). Since @xmath extends the identity on @xmath ,
Lemmas 5.5.9 and 5.5.10 yield that @xmath is bicontinuous. ∎

###### Corollary 5.5.12.

@xmath is a homeomorphism between @xmath and @xmath .∎

###### Corollary 5.5.13.

@xmath is Hausdorff if and only if @xmath is locally finite.

###### Proof.

Combine Theorem 5.5.11 and Corollary 3.3.10 . ∎

We close this chapter with a comparison of the cardinalities of @xmath
and @xmath :

###### Lemma 5.5.14.

For all @xmath , every @xmath and each non-principal ultrafilter @xmath
on @xmath there is some unique @xmath with @xmath and @xmath .

###### Proof.

Put @xmath and note that this is the only ultrafilter on @xmath
extending @xmath . Using Corollary 2.3.2 we uniquely extend it to an
element @xmath of @xmath . In particular, @xmath is uniquely determined
by @xmath , and clearly we have @xmath . For every @xmath the set @xmath
is a singleton contained in @xmath , therefore witnessing @xmath . Thus
@xmath follows due to @xmath . ∎

###### Proposition 5.5.15.

If @xmath is an infinite graph, then

1.  @xmath ,

2.  @xmath ,

3.  @xmath .

###### Proof.

(i). By Proposition 5.3.8 the map @xmath is a bijection from @xmath onto
@xmath . Furthermore, @xmath implies @xmath .

(ii). By Lemma 3.3.4 we have @xmath . By Lemma 3.3.2 we know that @xmath
holds for all @xmath . Since the set @xmath is infinite, there exist at
least @xmath many non-principal ultrafilters on it, and by Lemma 5.5.14
each of these extends to a unique element of @xmath . In particular,
@xmath has cardinality at least @xmath . Since @xmath is an equivalence
relation, this implies @xmath .

(iii) follows from (i) and (ii) combined. ∎

#### 5.6 @xmath described by tangles

In [ 14 ] , @xmath was use as a technical description of @xmath .
Recently, we created @xmath inspired by @xmath , and we showed that
@xmath is homeomorphic to a natural quotient of @xmath , namely @xmath .
So perhaps it is possible to describe @xmath using tangles of @xmath ?

Indeed, it turns out that considering a smaller separation system
suffices: Let @xmath be the set of all @xmath with @xmath for which
there is no @xmath such that both @xmath and @xmath are infinite. Write
@xmath for the set of all @xmath -tangles with respect to @xmath . For
every @xmath and @xmath we let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Like for elements of @xmath , it is easy to check that this is indeed an
element of @xmath .

###### Lemma 5.6.1.

Let @xmath and @xmath be such that both @xmath and @xmath are finite.
Then @xmath .

###### Proof.

Assume for a contradiction that @xmath holds, witnessed by some @xmath .
Let @xmath be the bipartition of @xmath with @xmath and @xmath . By
choice of @xmath , both @xmath and @xmath are infinite. Next, put

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

and note that both @xmath and @xmath are finite, since @xmath is finite.
By choice of @xmath we know that all but finitely many element of @xmath
are included in @xmath , and all but finitely elements of @xmath are
included in @xmath . We write @xmath and @xmath for the sets of those
elements, respectively.

If @xmath holds, then there is some @xmath with @xmath . Without loss of
generality we may assume that @xmath . Since both @xmath and @xmath are
infinite, so is @xmath , the desired contradiction.

Otherwise @xmath holds, so @xmath and @xmath together with @xmath
witness @xmath , a contradiction. ∎

###### Lemma 5.6.2.

Let @xmath and @xmath be given. If @xmath is such that both @xmath and
@xmath are finite, then @xmath .

###### Proof.

We mimic the proof of [ 14 , Lemma 1.10] . By Lemma 5.6.1 we know that
the three separations @xmath and @xmath are in @xmath . First note that
it suffices to show that @xmath implies @xmath : then @xmath follows
from @xmath and the consistency of @xmath .

As @xmath holds, we have @xmath by consistency. Due to @xmath the only
possibility for @xmath is @xmath as desired. ∎

The next lemma is an analogue of [ 14 , Lemma 2.2] , and with a bit of
extra work we can mimic Diestel’s proof.

###### Lemma 5.6.3.

Let @xmath and @xmath be given. Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

Set @xmath and note that this is in @xmath . We check two cases:

First suppose that @xmath holds for some @xmath and let @xmath be such
that @xmath and @xmath , i.e. @xmath . We wish to show @xmath , since
then @xmath implies @xmath as desired. For this, set @xmath and let
@xmath be such that @xmath and @xmath . By choice of @xmath we have
@xmath . Now @xmath implies @xmath by definition of @xmath , so in
particular we have @xmath . By Lemma 5.6.1 , @xmath implies @xmath .
Furthermore, @xmath holds since we have @xmath and @xmath by choice of
@xmath . Hence @xmath together with @xmath implies @xmath by the
consistency of @xmath . In particular, Lemma 5.6.2 implies @xmath as
desired.

Second suppose that @xmath is of the form @xmath for some @xmath , and
assume for a contradiction that @xmath . In particular, we find some
cofinite subset @xmath of @xmath with @xmath . Let @xmath be such that
@xmath and @xmath . We wish to show @xmath , since then @xmath yields a
contradiction as desired. For this, set @xmath and let @xmath be such
that @xmath and @xmath . Since @xmath is a cofinite subset of @xmath ,
we have @xmath . In particular, since @xmath holds by definition of
@xmath , we also have @xmath . By Lemma 5.6.1 , @xmath implies @xmath .
As in the first case this yields @xmath as desired. ∎

###### Theorem 5.6.4.

The @xmath -tangles of @xmath with respect to @xmath are precisely the
limits of the inverse system @xmath .

###### Proof.

Define @xmath by setting @xmath for every @xmath . By Lemma 5.6.3 this
is well-defined, and it is easy to see that @xmath is injective. It
remains to show that @xmath is surjective. For this, let any @xmath be
given.

If @xmath is principal for all @xmath , then @xmath comes from an end
@xmath of @xmath . Furthermore, @xmath induces an @xmath -tangle @xmath
of @xmath with respect to @xmath , and @xmath induces the element @xmath
of @xmath . Clearly, @xmath sends @xmath to @xmath .

Otherwise @xmath is non-empty. By Proposition 5.5.2 , the map @xmath is
bijective, so there is some @xmath with @xmath . Then @xmath corresponds
to the @xmath -tangle @xmath of @xmath with respect to @xmath , and
@xmath sends @xmath to @xmath . ∎

#### 5.7 @xmath as inverse limit

In section 4 we created an inverse system @xmath whose inverse limit
describes the tangle compactification in that there exists a natural
homeomorphism between @xmath and @xmath . In this chapter we define a
subset @xmath of @xmath , and we show that @xmath describes @xmath .

For every @xmath let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and let @xmath be the set of all @xmath with @xmath of the form

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (12)
  -- -------- -- ------

where each @xmath is a cofinite partition of @xmath . Letting @xmath
inherit the partial ordering from @xmath yields a directed poset:

###### Lemma 5.7.1.

@xmath is a directed poset.

###### Proof.

Let any two @xmath be given. Our task is to find some @xmath with @xmath
and @xmath . Put @xmath and suppose that @xmath is of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath some cofinite partition of @xmath for every @xmath . For
every @xmath set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

(this is a cofinite partition of @xmath ) and for every @xmath put
@xmath . Then let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and note that @xmath is an element of @xmath . Define @xmath similarly.
Then both @xmath and @xmath include @xmath . For every @xmath choose
@xmath to be the coarsest partition of @xmath refining both @xmath and
@xmath , and note that @xmath is again cofinite. Let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then @xmath holds as desired. ∎

If we recall the inverse system @xmath from section 4 , then obviously
the inverse limit @xmath should describe @xmath . But the elements of
@xmath are rather complicated, while a much easier attempt seems
possible: For every @xmath write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and consider the subset

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

of @xmath which is also directed since @xmath holds for all @xmath .
Furthermore, we can show that

###### Lemma 5.7.2.

@xmath is cofinal in @xmath .

###### Proof.

Let any @xmath be given where @xmath is of the form ( 12 ). For every
element @xmath of

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

pick a vertex @xmath . Set @xmath which is finite. Then @xmath holds as
desired. ∎

Hence if @xmath describes @xmath , then so should @xmath by Lemma 2.2.8
. But given @xmath and @xmath it is not straightforward to construct a
@xmath together with an open set in @xmath corresponding to @xmath (an
approach similar to the idea of the proof of Lemma 5.7.2 works to derive
@xmath from @xmath ). Hence if we want to put our inverse limit
description to use, the superior simplicity of @xmath comes at the cost
of ‘quality of life’. Since the whole purpose of this inverse limit
description is to increase our ‘quality of life’, we take @xmath over
@xmath , keeping in mind that @xmath always is an option by Lemma 2.2.8
.

Thus we set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It remains to show @xmath . Since the definition of the @xmath deviates
from that of the @xmath too much, we cannot simply claim that mimicking
the proof of Theorem 4.3.1 will do, but neither do we wish to redo all
of the work. Since it is clear that a homeomorphism defined similarly to
the one constructed in the proof of Theorem 4.3.1 should do, we do not
lose any insights when we use Lemma 2.2.6 over an explicit construction.

For this, we define a continuous surjection @xmath for every @xmath as
follows: We let @xmath map every vertex to the partition class of @xmath
containing it. If @xmath is an inner edge point of some edge @xmath of
@xmath , then if @xmath is an edge of @xmath we let @xmath , and
otherwise we let @xmath map @xmath to the non-singleton partition class
of @xmath containing the endvertices of @xmath . Finally if @xmath is an
element of @xmath we let @xmath assign @xmath to @xmath where @xmath is
the unique element of @xmath .

If @xmath is open in @xmath for some @xmath , then we denote by @xmath
the set @xmath with @xmath for all @xmath and @xmath .

###### Lemma 5.7.3.

The maps @xmath are compatible.

###### Proof.

Let @xmath be elements of @xmath , and let @xmath be given; we have to
show

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (13)
  -- -------- -- ------

This is clear for @xmath , so we may assume that that @xmath is an
element of @xmath . Write @xmath , @xmath , and let @xmath and @xmath be
the unique elements of @xmath and @xmath , respectively. By definition
of @xmath we know that in order to verify ( 13 ) it suffices to show

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (14)
  -- -------- -- ------

For this we check several cases:

First suppose that @xmath holds for some @xmath . Then @xmath is of the
form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the @xmath are cofinite partitions of @xmath and @xmath is the
unique infinite element of @xmath . If @xmath holds, then @xmath is of
the form @xmath where @xmath is the unique component of @xmath including
@xmath . Then @xmath and @xmath yield

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

as desired. Otherwise @xmath implies @xmath . We may assume that @xmath
is of the form ( 12 ). In particular, @xmath is the unique infinite
element of @xmath . Since @xmath is cofinite in @xmath and @xmath is
cofinite in @xmath (Observation 3.3.1 ) we know that @xmath is cofinite
in @xmath . Now some @xmath satisfies @xmath due to @xmath , and since
@xmath is cofinite in @xmath , the only possibility for @xmath is @xmath
as desired.

For the second case suppose that @xmath holds for some component @xmath
of @xmath . In particular @xmath is in @xmath due to @xmath . Let @xmath
be the unique component of @xmath including @xmath . Then the definition
of @xmath yields @xmath , and @xmath implies @xmath . Let @xmath be the
partition class with @xmath (which exists due to @xmath ). In
particular, @xmath must contain @xmath since @xmath does, so @xmath
follows. Assume for a contradiction that @xmath and @xmath are distinct:
then @xmath and @xmath are disjoint partition classes of @xmath , so
@xmath implies @xmath contradicting @xmath . Hence @xmath yields ( 14 )
as desired. ∎

###### Lemma 5.7.4.

The maps @xmath are continuous.∎

###### Theorem 5.7.5.

For every graph @xmath we have @xmath .

###### Proof.

Consider the map

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

which clearly is injective. By Theorem 5.4.2 we know that @xmath is
compact. Since the @xmath are surjective, so are the @xmath . Hence by
Lemmas 5.7.3 and 5.7.4 the @xmath form a compatible system of continuous
surjections, and applying Lemma 2.2.6 yields that @xmath is also a
continuous surjection. It remains to verify that @xmath is continuous.
For this, let any point @xmath of @xmath be given together with some
basic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath .

If @xmath is in @xmath we choose some @xmath such that @xmath is
contained in the 1-complex of @xmath , and set @xmath . Then @xmath is
also a basic open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath , so @xmath holds.

Otherwise @xmath is an element of @xmath and we check two subcases.
First, if @xmath is of the form @xmath for some @xmath and @xmath , then
we let @xmath be a partition of @xmath such that @xmath is a singleton
partition class of @xmath and @xmath . Next, we consider the basic open
neighbourhood @xmath of the dummy vertex @xmath in @xmath . Clearly,
@xmath holds as desired. For the second subcase suppose that @xmath is
of the form @xmath for some @xmath with @xmath a cofinite subset of
@xmath for some @xmath . Then we let @xmath be a partition of @xmath
such that @xmath is a partition class of @xmath and @xmath . Considering
the basic open neighbourhood @xmath of the dummy vertex @xmath in @xmath
yields @xmath as expected. Thus @xmath is continuous. ∎

###### Corollary 5.7.6.

For every infinite graph @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

Combine Theorem 5.7.5 with Lemmas 2.2.8 and 5.7.2 . ∎

#### 5.8 Outlook

Of course, finding meaningful graph theoretical reasons to consider
@xmath -systems or @xmath is of highest interest. Since we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

it might be possible to show that the @xmath -tangles of @xmath w.r.t
@xmath induce precisely the @xmath -tangles of @xmath w.r.t @xmath ,
where @xmath is the set of all @xmath respecting the finite partition
@xmath of @xmath .

Finally, it remains to compare @xmath and @xmath in the wild. Since
@xmath is so much bigger than @xmath , it might be easier to get some
generalisation of thins sums to work in a modified version of @xmath
than in a modified version of @xmath . On the other hand, we might run
into dependencies on certain models of ZFC.

### 6 Auxiliary edges and tree-packing

In this chapter, @xmath is always assumed to be connected.

#### 6.1 Introduction

By now, the topological cycle space of locally finite graphs has been
the subject of extensive studies, but several problems are known to
occur in straightforward generalisations to arbitrary infinite graphs.
For example consider the heavy edge sets in the following three graphs:

All heavy edge sets can be obtained as thin sum of all the facial cycles
of their respective graphs, and hence should be elements of their cycle
spaces. For the top left graph, a solution is known: Identifying the end
with its dominating vertex yields a compact Hausdorff quotient @xmath of
@xmath whose topology is known as ITop . In this quotient, the ray
actually converges to its dominating vertex, as pictured below:

Studying this quotient proved rewarding, e.g. see [ 3 ] and [ 9 ] . For
the graph @xmath on the bottom left of Fig. 6 , however, @xmath is not
defined since the relation we would use to yield @xmath no longer is
transitive. Obviously, we could fix this by taking the transitive
closure of that relation, but this would result in vertex
identification, which we want to avoid at all cost. Finally, consider
the graph @xmath on the right in Fig. 6 . This graph has no end, and
hence VTop is Hausdorff, but not compact, and identifying the two
vertices of infinite degree does not change that. A space solving all
our problems by using vertex identification is already known: @xmath is
compact Hausdorff, and many of the theorems known for locally finite
graphs admit easy generalisations to @xmath for arbitrary infinite
graphs (among these we find a working cycle space):

This is possible thanks to the inverse limit @xmath describing @xmath .
But @xmath has a huge downside: since it uses vertex identification, we
lose the structure of the graph. For an extreme example, consider the
graph @xmath from Fig. 9 . Clearly, this graph admits a very rich
structure, e.g. its underlying binary tree plus the edge @xmath yields
an NST and in @xmath we find an edge-less Hamilton circle (see [ 8 ,
Proposition 3.4 and Corollary 3.5] ). ³³ ³³ 33 This is one reason why
the usage of ITop is commonly restricted to finitely separable graphs.
But since no two of its vertices are finitely separable, @xmath is just
a hawaiian earring, and we may say that @xmath takes the sledgehammer
approach by sacrificing the structure of our graphs in exchange for easy
generalisations.

Let us have a look on the topologies considered so far from another
perspective. Generally speaking, ITop approaches the generalisation
problem ‘from bottom up’ by using the straightforward generalisation
VTop of the Freudenthal compactification—which is natural on locally
finite graphs—on arbitrary graphs, then fixing problems by moving on to
a Hausdorff quotient and restriction to a suitable class of graphs
(which is still big enough to be of interest).

The tangle compactification on the other hand naturally extends the
Freu-
denthal compactification to arbitrary infinite graphs in that it uses
@xmath -tangles to compactify the 1-complex of @xmath . Yet it seems
like the tangle compactification is not the ‘right setting’ for
arbitrary infinite graphs: First of all, we recall from the introduction
of this work that a @xmath admits some set of edges which we expect to
induce a TST of the tangle compactification, but which has no meaningful
acirclic and topologically connected superset. Second, Lemma 3.1.4 tells
us that arcs in the tangle compactification default to arcs in @xmath ,
i.e. the arcs avoid the ultrafilter tangles. But it would be great if at
least leanly structured countable graphs would admit arc-connected
circles and TSTs using ultrafilter tangles in order to overcome the
difficulties discussed earlier.

Therefore, we have two choices. First, we may stick to our definitions
of circles and TSTs in terms of arcs while modifying the tangle
compactification in some way deemed natural. Second, we may adjust both
the tangle compactification and our definitions of circles and TSTs.
Since our definitions of circles and TSTs heavily rely on the unit
interval while we do not impose any cardinal bounds on our graphs, the
second choice is more appealing.

If we modify the tangle compactification, we should see to it that the
resulting space @xmath is both compact and Hausdorff: then @xmath is a
continuum and the field of continuum theory provides us with a useful
tool box. But what could @xmath look like? Of course, it should solve
our earlier problems from Fig. 6 . On the other hand, it should admit a
TST even for the graph @xmath from Fig. 9 . Here, the obstruction in
@xmath is the existence of an edge-less Hamilton circle. This circle
does not look very ‘circle-like’ in that drawing, hence let us draw the
graph again, but this time we start with a circle in the plane ( @xmath
, say) and embed the vertices of @xmath into it discretely, as sketched
in Fig. 10 .

Now the idea of a circle consisting exactly of the vertices and ends of
@xmath appears much less inconvenient, doesn’t it? Also, the (finite)
cycles induced by the boundaries of the inner faces seem to converge to
@xmath in some sense. Let us state this more clear:

For every @xmath denote by @xmath the set of all (finite) cycles which
are induced by face boundaries of the drawing above, and which only meet
@xmath in @xmath . Then for every @xmath there is some @xmath such that
the (finite) cycle @xmath with edge set @xmath is included in @xmath .
Also note that @xmath holds.

This gives us a first hint: if we introduce some sort of limit edges,
one between every end of @xmath and each of its dominating vertices, and
if we embed these into @xmath appropriately (which is possible since we
embedded @xmath discretely), then the edge-less Hamilton circle is no
longer edge-less. Furthermore, by the looks of the drawing, it should
not be a problem to define basic open neighbourhoods of the inner edge
points of these limit edges such that the sequence @xmath ‘converges’ to
our Hamilton circle induced by the limit edges. On top of that, the
obvious NST of @xmath (the underlying @xmath plus the edge @xmath ) now
should induce a TST, and the Hamilton circle minus one of its limit
edges should be a TST.

But what about a @xmath or graphs admitting ultrafilter tangles in
general? In case of @xmath , if we remember why the expected TST did not
work out, the problem informally amounted to the ultrafilter tangles not
being ‘sufficiently connected’ to the two vertices of infinite degree.
Furthermore, we cannot meaningfully modify the topology of the tangle
compactification of this graph into a Hausdorff one without losing
compactness. But if we join every ultrafilter tangle @xmath of @xmath to
each vertex in @xmath via a limit edge, and if we generalise the
topology of the tangle compactification in an MTop -like way onto the
new space (treating inner limit edge points almost like tangles), then
we obtain a continuum.

Since the space @xmath is not that easy to work with, we dedicate this
chapter to a Hausdorff auxiliary space @xmath which in general is not
compact, but whose structure combinatorially captures the basic
structure of @xmath . Informally, @xmath is obtained from @xmath with
MTop by disjointly adding auxiliary (multi-)edges between every end of
@xmath and each of its dominating vertices, and between any two distinct
vertices of the same critical vertex set (one for each critical vertex
set both are contained in). As basic open neighbourhoods of the inner
edge points of auxiliary edges we take the same ones as for inner edge
points of edges of @xmath , and we carefully adjust the open
neighbourhoods of other points to include also half-open partial
auxiliary edges.

As we have seen two times before, if we construct a TST in @xmath , then
its inner edge points do not induce a TST of @xmath , e.g. in a @xmath
the sole non-singleton @xmath -class of @xmath (which consists of all
ultrafilter tangles and the two vertices of infinite degree; also recall
@xmath ) is totally disconnected in @xmath . But in @xmath that @xmath
-class minus the ultrafilter tangles plus the auxiliary edge between its
two vertices is arc-connected. As it turns out, between every two
distinct points @xmath and @xmath of @xmath there exists an auxiliary
arc from @xmath to @xmath if and only if @xmath , where an auxiliary arc
simply is an arc in the closure of the set of all auxiliary edges (see
Sections 6.3 and 6.4 ). Interestingly, this holds without any
cardinality bounds imposed on the graph considered. Hence, if we wish to
prove a statement about the existence of certain structures in @xmath ,
then the following two step procedure might be worth a try: First, prove
it for @xmath using @xmath . Second, ‘lift’ the obtained structures to
@xmath by expanding the non-trivial @xmath -classes to something
auxiliary arc-connected. For the rest of the section, we carry out this
procedure to prove a generalisation of tree-packing (with the usual
circle and TST definitions) for countable graphs, demonstrating the
synergy of the two spaces @xmath and @xmath .

For finite graphs, the so-called ‘tree packing’ is a fundamental theorem
that was proved by Nash-Williams and Tutte independently in 1961:

###### Theorem 6.1.1 ([13, Theorem 2.4.1]).

The following are equivalent for all finite multigraphs @xmath and
@xmath :

1.  @xmath contains @xmath edge-disjoint spanning trees.

2.  @xmath has at least @xmath edges across any finite vertex partition
    @xmath .

For infinite graphs, however, the naive generalisation fails. Indeed,
let @xmath be a @xmath whose vertices of infinite degree we denote by
@xmath and @xmath . Furthermore, we enumerate the other vertices of
@xmath as @xmath . Now we show that @xmath satisfies (ii) for @xmath .
For this, let @xmath be any finite vertex partition of @xmath . If
@xmath and @xmath are contained in different partition classes, with
@xmath say, then infinitely many edges leave @xmath since there are
infinitely many disjoint paths from @xmath to @xmath in @xmath , so (ii)
holds. Otherwise @xmath and @xmath are contained in the same partition
class @xmath , say. If there are infinitely many of the @xmath not
contained in @xmath , then again infinitely many edges leave @xmath ,
witnessing (ii). Hence we may assume that @xmath contains all but
finitely many of the @xmath . Then for every @xmath the partition class
@xmath is a finite subset of @xmath , and every edge leaving @xmath is
incident with precisely one of @xmath and @xmath . Thus exactly @xmath
many edges leave @xmath . By choice of @xmath the partition @xmath has
precisely

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

many cross-edges, so again (ii) holds. This completes the verification
of (ii) for @xmath . But obviously, every spanning tree of @xmath has
degree 2 at some @xmath . In particular, every two spanning trees of
@xmath share an edge, so (i) fails as claimed.

The TSTs of known topologies on @xmath (not relying on
vertex-identification) face the same problem, but @xmath does not:

Of course the two TSTs of @xmath depicted in Fig. 11 share an edge, but
this is not an edge of @xmath , and clearly this is best possible for
@xmath . Furthermore, the shared auxiliary edge indicates that its
endvertices are in the same (infinitely edge-connected) @xmath -class,
so both TSTs share an artificial edge which represents infinite
edge-connectivity.

#### 6.2 The space @xmath

In this section, we formally define the topological space @xmath which
makes use of auxiliary edges.

For this, we let

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

and we let @xmath be the multigraph on @xmath with edge set @xmath where
every @xmath has endvertices @xmath and @xmath . The elements of @xmath
are referred to as auxiliary edges . Unless stated otherwise, our
standard notation such as @xmath , @xmath and @xmath still depends on
@xmath , not on @xmath . Next, we obtain a topological space @xmath with
ground set the 1-complex of @xmath by declaring as (basic) open the
following sets:

For inner edge points of @xmath we take the usual basic open
neighbourhoods. For every vertex @xmath of @xmath and every @xmath we
declare as open the star @xmath of half-open intervals. Finally, for
every @xmath , for each @xmath and for all @xmath take

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

(Informally, if @xmath is of the form @xmath for some end @xmath of
@xmath , then we may think of @xmath as @xmath plus (possibly half-open
partial) auxiliary edges.) Using Corollary 3.3.6 it is easy to check
that this really yields a topology. Similar to @xmath and @xmath , for
every @xmath and @xmath we write

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

###### Observation 6.2.1.

@xmath is Hausdorff.

###### Lemma 6.2.2.

The finite cuts of @xmath are finite cuts of @xmath .

###### Proof.

This follows from Theorem 3.3.5 and the fact that no finite cut
separates an end from any of its dominating vertices. ∎

###### Lemma 6.2.3.

Let @xmath be given together with a bipartition @xmath of @xmath .
Furthermore suppose that @xmath is a connected subset of @xmath meeting
both @xmath and @xmath . Then @xmath meets @xmath .

###### Proof.

Otherwise @xmath induces an open bipartition of @xmath which is
impossible. ∎

The following Lemma basically restates the first part of the Jumping Arc
Lemma [ 13 , Lemma 8.5.3 (i)] for @xmath . Hence, with Lemma 6.2.2 the
proof is analogue:

###### Lemma 6.2.4 (@xmath).

Let @xmath be a finite cut of @xmath with sides @xmath and @xmath . Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and no connected subset of @xmath meets both @xmath and @xmath .∎

An arc @xmath is called an auxiliary arc if @xmath .

###### Lemma 6.2.5 (@xmath).

@xmath is dense in @xmath for every arc @xmath in @xmath .

###### Proof.

First choose a homeomorphism @xmath . We claim that @xmath . Assume not
for a contradiction. Then @xmath since @xmath is closed. Pick some
@xmath together with some basic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in
@xmath which avoids @xmath . It is impossible to find such a
neighbourhood for vertices of @xmath or inner edge points of @xmath , so
@xmath must be an end of @xmath . Let @xmath be some basic open subset
of @xmath which @xmath maps to @xmath . Then @xmath holds by the
previous argument. Hence it suffices to show that there is no arc living
entirely in @xmath to yield a contradiction:

Assume for a contradiction that there is an arc @xmath starting in
@xmath and ending in @xmath , say. Pick some @xmath witnessing @xmath .
Then @xmath avoids @xmath , contradicting Observation 6.2.3 . ∎

If @xmath is a subgraph of @xmath , then we write @xmath for its closure
in @xmath . If a subspace @xmath of @xmath is of the form @xmath and
every @xmath is incident with an auxiliary edge from @xmath , then we
call @xmath a standard subspace of @xmath and write @xmath . By Lemma
6.2.5 we have @xmath if @xmath is arc-connected. An @xmath TST of @xmath
is a uniquely arc-connected standard subspace of @xmath including @xmath
. If @xmath is an auxiliary arc-component of @xmath and @xmath is a
uniquely arc-connected standard subspace with @xmath , then @xmath is
called an @xmath TST of @xmath . If @xmath is an @xmath TST of @xmath or
of an auxiliary arc-component of @xmath and @xmath is any edge in @xmath
, then @xmath has precisely two arc-components @xmath and @xmath and we
write @xmath for the fundamental cut of @xmath (with respect to @xmath )
which consists precisely of those edges of @xmath with one endvertex in
@xmath and the other in @xmath . A circle of @xmath is the image of a
homeomorphic embedding of @xmath into @xmath . By Lemma 6.2.5 every
circle of @xmath is a standard subspace of @xmath . If @xmath is a
circle of @xmath , then @xmath is a circuit .

###### Observation 6.2.6.

If @xmath is an NST of @xmath and @xmath is the closure of @xmath in
@xmath , then @xmath naturally extends to an ordering @xmath of @xmath .
Furthermore, by Theorem 3.3.5 , all the sets @xmath and @xmath (where
@xmath and @xmath ) form chains in @xmath . Hence if @xmath is an edge
of @xmath with @xmath , then all edges of @xmath (in particular those of
@xmath ) are incident with @xmath .

###### Lemma 6.2.7 (@xmath).

Let @xmath be a any graph and let @xmath be an NST of @xmath . Then the
closure of @xmath in @xmath is a TST of @xmath with respect to @xmath .

###### Proof.

Let @xmath denote the closure of @xmath in @xmath . Using normal rays it
is straightforward to show that @xmath is arc-connected, so assume for a
contradiction that there is some circle @xmath . By Lemma 6.2.5 we may
pick some edge @xmath of @xmath which @xmath traverses. Without loss of
generality we have @xmath since @xmath is an edge of the graph @xmath by
choice of @xmath . Now consider the arc @xmath . Since @xmath is an NST
we know that @xmath where @xmath and @xmath . But then

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

induces an open bipartition of @xmath since @xmath . ∎

#### 6.3 Construction of auxiliary arcs

The aim of this section is to construct an auxiliary arc between any two
distinct vertices of @xmath which are not finitely separable. In order
to do this, we will approximate a topological path in @xmath between the
two vertices via a countable linear ordering on some special set of
vertices. Then we ‘fill in the gaps’ of that linear ordering with inner
edge points of auxiliary edges and ends of @xmath , yielding a
topological path between the two vertices in @xmath . Finally, since we
cannot guarantee injectivity at the ends of @xmath , we involve general
topology to obtain the desired auxiliary arc.

Suppose that @xmath and @xmath are two distinct vertices of @xmath with
@xmath and denote by @xmath the set of all @xmath - @xmath paths in
@xmath . Every path @xmath naturally induces a linear ordering @xmath on
its vertex set with @xmath , and for each @xmath we denote by @xmath the
linear ordering on @xmath induced by @xmath . Furthermore, for every
@xmath we define a map @xmath with domain @xmath by letting

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for each @xmath . In addition, for every @xmath we set up a function
@xmath by letting

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for every @xmath . Hence @xmath is an inverse system and the diagram

[]

is easily seen to commute.

Since @xmath holds, we inductively find some countably infinite subset
@xmath of @xmath consisting of edge-disjoint @xmath - @xmath paths. For
every @xmath we let @xmath be the set of all @xmath with @xmath
infinite, i.e. @xmath is in @xmath if and only if @xmath sends some
infinitely many paths of @xmath to @xmath . Then it is easy to check
that @xmath is an inverse system. Clearly, every @xmath is finite, and
so is every @xmath . Hence all @xmath are non-empty by pigeon-hole
principle, so the Generalized Infinity Lemma ( 2.2.4 ) yields some

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (15)
  -- -------- -- ------

###### Theorem 6.3.1.

Let @xmath be any graph, and let @xmath and @xmath be two distinct
vertices of @xmath . Then @xmath if and only if there is some auxiliary
arc from @xmath to @xmath .

###### Proof.

The backward direction is immediate from Lemma 6.2.4 .

For the forward direction suppose that @xmath holds and consider the
family from ( 15 ) constructed above. Write @xmath for every @xmath and
put @xmath . By standard inverse limit arguments it is straightforward
to check that @xmath is a linear ordering on @xmath with least element
@xmath and greatest element @xmath . Since @xmath is a subset of @xmath
and @xmath is countable, we know that @xmath is countable.

If @xmath is finite, then @xmath holds: Otherwise Corollary 3.2.5 yields
some @xmath disjoint from @xmath such that @xmath separates @xmath and
@xmath in @xmath . Set @xmath . Then we have @xmath since @xmath avoids
@xmath . Pick some @xmath edge-disjoint from the finite set @xmath with
@xmath . Then @xmath is an @xmath – @xmath path which avoids both @xmath
and @xmath , which is impossible since @xmath separates @xmath and
@xmath in @xmath . Hence @xmath holds, so by Theorem 3.3.5 there exists
a path from @xmath to @xmath in @xmath using only auxiliary edges. In
particular, we find an auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath .

Therefore, we may assume that @xmath is infinite. Now consider the set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and let @xmath be the linear ordering on @xmath induced by the
lexicographic ordering on @xmath , where @xmath is linearly ordered by
@xmath and @xmath inherits its ordering from @xmath . Since @xmath is
countable we find some order preserving injection @xmath with @xmath and
@xmath . Note that @xmath is discrete ³⁴ ³⁴ 34 i.e. every point in
@xmath is isolated in @xmath . Next define @xmath by letting @xmath for
every @xmath . Then the linear ordering on @xmath inherited from @xmath
via @xmath coincides with @xmath . Furthermore, the image of @xmath is
discrete in @xmath , so for every @xmath we may pick some @xmath such
that @xmath meets the image of @xmath precisely in @xmath .

An @xmath - blank (where @xmath is some function into @xmath ) is a
non-empty open interval @xmath with @xmath . Clearly, any two @xmath
-blanks are disjoint. Since every @xmath -blank contains a rational
number, there are only countably many @xmath -blanks, so we may consider
some enumeration @xmath of all @xmath -blanks where @xmath . Also note
that every @xmath -blank avoids @xmath for every @xmath . In order to
get rid of the @xmath -blanks, define @xmath as follows: let @xmath and
for every other @xmath pick

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

Then the image of @xmath is again discrete by choice of @xmath .
Furthermore @xmath is injective and the ordering on @xmath inherited
from @xmath via @xmath coincides with @xmath . By construction, there
are no @xmath -blanks. For ease of notation we that @xmath holds. As
before, for every @xmath we pick some @xmath such that @xmath meets the
image of @xmath precisely in @xmath , e.g. set @xmath . Let @xmath which
is the set of all accumulation points of the discrete image of @xmath in
@xmath . In order to obtain a topological @xmath – @xmath path in @xmath
we need some more information about @xmath first:

###### Claim 1.

Let @xmath be given and suppose that there is some @xmath such that
@xmath and @xmath . Then there is some @xmath with @xmath .

###### Proof of the Claim.

Assume not for a contradiction. Then by Lemma 3.2.4 we find some @xmath
with @xmath such that @xmath separates @xmath and @xmath in @xmath . Put
@xmath and pick some @xmath with @xmath and @xmath . Then @xmath meets
@xmath in some vertex @xmath . Hence @xmath implies @xmath , but then
@xmath witnesses @xmath and thus @xmath , a contradiction. ∎

###### Claim 2.

Let @xmath be given together with a sequence @xmath in @xmath such that
@xmath for @xmath . Then @xmath has a subsequence which converges to
some @xmath in @xmath .

###### Proof of the Claim.

Without loss of generality we may assume that our sequence satisfies
@xmath for all @xmath . Inductively we define @xmath and @xmath by
letting

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and picking some @xmath with @xmath , for every @xmath . Then @xmath
avoids all @xmath with @xmath since otherwise @xmath would witness
@xmath for some @xmath , which is impossible. Consider the connected
infinite subgraph @xmath of @xmath . We claim that @xmath is even
locally finite:

Assume not for a contradiction, witnessed by some vertex @xmath of
@xmath of infinite degree. This vertex is none of the @xmath since each
@xmath avoids all @xmath with @xmath . Let @xmath be the infinite set of
all @xmath with @xmath , and let @xmath . Then @xmath is in @xmath for
all @xmath . Pick some @xmath with @xmath . Then @xmath contains @xmath
while @xmath and @xmath hold, so @xmath witnesses @xmath . But then for
every @xmath with @xmath we know that @xmath implies @xmath , which is
impossible since @xmath is infinite. Hence @xmath is locally finite.

Therefore, since @xmath is connected, infinite and locally finite,
applying the Star-Comb Lemma ( [ 13 , Lemma 8.2.2] ) yields a comb with
all teeth in @xmath . Let @xmath be its spine, and let @xmath be the end
of @xmath containing @xmath . Since every basic open neighbourhood of
@xmath in @xmath is of the form @xmath for some @xmath , only finitely
many teeth of the comb can lie outside of this neighbourhood. Therefore,
the teeth of the comb form a subsequence of @xmath which converges to
@xmath in @xmath as desired. ∎

###### Claim 3.

In the context of Claim 2 , suppose that there is some @xmath with
@xmath and @xmath . Then @xmath dominates @xmath .

###### Proof of the Claim.

Assume not for a contradiction, witnessed by some @xmath . Without loss
of generality the whole sequence @xmath converges to @xmath in @xmath .
Pick @xmath such that @xmath holds for all @xmath . For every @xmath let
@xmath and pick some @xmath with @xmath . Then @xmath meets @xmath in
some @xmath , so @xmath and @xmath follow. By pigeon-hole principle we
find some infinite @xmath with @xmath for all @xmath . Then @xmath holds
for all @xmath . Since @xmath is infinite, this implies @xmath , a
contradiction. Therefore, @xmath dominates @xmath . ∎

Define @xmath as follows: On the image of @xmath we let @xmath for every
@xmath , so the diagram

[]

commutes. Next we write the set @xmath as disjoint union @xmath of
maximal non-empty intervals @xmath over some index set @xmath . Let
@xmath and @xmath for all @xmath . We distinguish several cases (see
Fig. 12 for an illustration):

1.  @xmath , i.e. @xmath

2.  @xmath with @xmath and @xmath , i.e. @xmath

3.  @xmath with @xmath and @xmath , i.e. @xmath

4.  @xmath with @xmath and @xmath , i.e. @xmath

There is no case (iv) covering ‘ @xmath with @xmath and @xmath , i.e.
@xmath ’ since there are no @xmath -blanks. Now given @xmath , we define
@xmath as follows:

First we consider case (i) , i.e. @xmath is a singleton. Let @xmath take
on the role of @xmath in Claim 2 and pick an arbitrary sequence @xmath
in @xmath witnessing @xmath , so Claim 2 yields some @xmath . Then we
set @xmath .

Next we consider case (iia) , i.e. @xmath with @xmath and @xmath . We
pick an arbitrary sequence @xmath in @xmath witnessing @xmath , so Claim
2 yields some @xmath . Letting @xmath take on the role of @xmath in
Claim 3 yields @xmath . Hence we let @xmath be a homeomorphism onto the
edge @xmath with @xmath . We treat Case (iib) analogously using the
symmetric analogue of Claim 3 .

Finally we consider case (iii) , i.e. @xmath with @xmath and @xmath .
Letting @xmath and @xmath take on the roles of @xmath and @xmath from
Claim 1 , respectively, yields some @xmath with @xmath . If @xmath is an
end of @xmath , then we write @xmath and note @xmath . Hence we pick
some @xmath and let @xmath and @xmath be homeomorphisms onto the edges
@xmath and @xmath , respectively, such that @xmath holds. Otherwise
@xmath is an ultrafilter tangle and we let @xmath be a homeomorphism
onto some auxiliary edge between @xmath and @xmath such that @xmath and
@xmath (such an auxiliary edge exists by Theorem 3.3.5 ). This completes
the definition of @xmath .

Note that @xmath holds by construction. Due to the Claims used for the
definition of @xmath , proving that @xmath is well defined amounts to
verifying that @xmath is continuous, and we will need the continuity of
@xmath in order to obtain an auxiliary arc from @xmath . Hence, we
verify that @xmath is continuous:

###### Claim 4.

@xmath is continuous.

###### Proof of the Claim.

Given @xmath (without loss of generality @xmath ) and @xmath some basic
open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath , we have to find some basic open
neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath which @xmath maps to @xmath .

If @xmath is a vertex @xmath of @xmath , then we find a suitable
neighbourhood of @xmath included in @xmath . Else if @xmath is an inner
edge point we are done, so finally suppose that @xmath . Thus @xmath is
of the form @xmath for some @xmath and @xmath . If @xmath is not in
@xmath , then @xmath was defined in case (iii) for some @xmath , and we
find some suitable open neighbourhood of @xmath included in @xmath .
Hence we may assume that @xmath is in @xmath . The rest of the proof is
dedicated to this case.

Assume for a contradiction that for every @xmath there is some @xmath
with @xmath . First, we obtain a sequence @xmath from @xmath with @xmath
for all @xmath and @xmath , as follows: Let any @xmath be given.

If @xmath is a vertex of @xmath , then we let @xmath .

Else if @xmath is an inner edge point of some auxiliary edge @xmath ,
then we pick @xmath such that @xmath is an endvertex of @xmath outside
of @xmath . For later use, we let @xmath denote the length of the closed
interval @xmath containing @xmath for which @xmath is a homeomorphism
onto the auxiliary edge @xmath .

Finally suppose that @xmath . We check two subcases: For the first
subcase suppose that @xmath is not in @xmath , so @xmath was defined in
case (iii) for some @xmath . Furthermore, @xmath implies that @xmath
avoids @xmath . Let @xmath and @xmath . Then neither of @xmath and
@xmath is in @xmath , since otherwise @xmath would separate one of
@xmath and @xmath from @xmath , contradicting @xmath . In particular,
@xmath is not in @xmath . If @xmath we let @xmath , and @xmath
otherwise. For the second subcase suppose that @xmath is in @xmath .
Then by definition of @xmath there is some sequence @xmath in @xmath
such that @xmath in @xmath and @xmath in @xmath for @xmath . Since
@xmath is Hausdorff and @xmath holds due to @xmath , we find some @xmath
such that @xmath and @xmath (which is possible due to @xmath ). Thus we
let @xmath . This completes the subcase and the definition of the @xmath
.

We still have to verify that @xmath holds. For this, let @xmath be the
set of all @xmath for which @xmath is an inner edge point of @xmath .
Clearly, @xmath was defined in one of the cases (i), (iia) and (iib) for
some @xmath . If @xmath was defined in case (i), i.e. with @xmath , then
for every @xmath both intervals @xmath and @xmath meet @xmath and one
easily checks that @xmath holds for @xmath and @xmath . Therefore,
@xmath for @xmath follows from the choice of the @xmath . Thus @xmath
holds for @xmath . Else if @xmath was defined in case (iia), i.e. with
@xmath and @xmath , then for every @xmath the interval @xmath meets
@xmath , but the interval @xmath does not. By construction, @xmath maps
@xmath to the interior of the auxiliary-edge @xmath . Hence @xmath
together with @xmath implies that @xmath must hold for all but finitely
many @xmath , without loss of generality for all @xmath . But then one
easily checks as before that @xmath holds, and thus @xmath . Otherwise
@xmath was defined in case (iib), which follows from (iia) via symmetry,
completing the proof of @xmath .

Therefore, @xmath is a sequence in @xmath with @xmath for all @xmath and
@xmath for @xmath . Applying Claim 2 to @xmath and @xmath yields a
convergent subsequence @xmath with limit @xmath . Since @xmath is
Hausdorff, the fact that no @xmath is in @xmath implies @xmath . Write
@xmath for all @xmath and note that @xmath holds for @xmath due to
@xmath and @xmath . Recall that Claim 2 was used in order to define
@xmath , so there is a sequence @xmath in @xmath with @xmath in @xmath
and @xmath in @xmath . ³⁵ ³⁵ 35 This is the convergent subsequence
mentioned in the conclusion of Claim 2 , not the sequence of the same
name mentioned in the premise of that claim. Pick some @xmath witnessing
@xmath , and choose some @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath hold for all
@xmath . For every @xmath let @xmath and pick some @xmath with @xmath .
Then @xmath meets @xmath in some @xmath between @xmath and @xmath (i.e.
@xmath if @xmath and @xmath otherwise) which yields @xmath , and
furthermore

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since @xmath is finite, by pigeon-hole principle we find some infinite
@xmath with @xmath for all @xmath . But then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

holds for all @xmath , yielding @xmath since @xmath is infinite and
@xmath holds as well as @xmath . Thus @xmath contradicts @xmath as
desired. Therefore, @xmath is continuous at @xmath . ∎

Since @xmath is Hausdorff, so is @xmath , and in particular @xmath is
also path-connected. Hence @xmath is arc-connected by Lemma 2.4.3 , so
we may let @xmath be an arc in @xmath from @xmath to @xmath . Since
@xmath only traverses auxiliary edges, Lemma 6.2.5 implies @xmath , so
@xmath is an auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath . ∎

We involve Lemma 2.4.3 at the end of the proof since @xmath may fail to
be injective at ends. Indeed, consider the one-ended grid on @xmath ,
and for each @xmath let @xmath denote the ray with vertex set @xmath .
Then let @xmath be obtained from this grid by replacing every edge of
every @xmath and the egde @xmath with a copy of a @xmath (with the two
vertices of infinite degree being identified with the endvertices of the
original egde).

Then @xmath admits two topological @xmath – @xmath paths in @xmath (see
Fig. 13 ), and only one of them is an auxiliary arc, while the other can
be obtained as @xmath for certain choices of @xmath .

#### 6.4 Basic properties of auxiliary arcs

###### Lemma 6.4.1.

Let @xmath be a any graph, let @xmath be a vertex of @xmath and @xmath a
sequence of vertices of @xmath with @xmath in @xmath for some end @xmath
of @xmath . Suppose that for every @xmath we have an auxiliary arc
@xmath from @xmath to @xmath . Then one of the following holds:

1.   There is some @xmath such that @xmath contains a vertex of @xmath
    which is the centre of an infinite star of auxiliary arcs included
    in the union of the @xmath with leaves in @xmath . In particular,
    that vertex dominates @xmath .

2.   There is an auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath included in @xmath
    .

In either case there exists an auxiliary arc @xmath from @xmath to
@xmath . Moreover, if all of the @xmath are tame, then so is @xmath .

###### Proof.

The proof basically mimics two proofs from the lecture course while
taking care of new special cases. First, we prove the statement of the
Lemma minus the ‘Moreover’-part.

Inductively we define a function @xmath together with an ascending
sequence @xmath of closed subsets of @xmath as follows: Let @xmath and
suppose that we are at step @xmath of the construction. Pick some @xmath
witnessing that @xmath is an @xmath – @xmath auxiliary arc, with @xmath
and @xmath , and let @xmath be maximal with @xmath . Such a @xmath
exists since @xmath is closed in @xmath and @xmath meets @xmath . Write
@xmath and @xmath . Furthermore, let @xmath be minimal with @xmath and
let @xmath . This completes the definition of the @xmath .

If there is some @xmath with @xmath we are done, so suppose @xmath and
consider the tree @xmath . We check two main cases:

For the first main case, suppose that @xmath is not locally finite,
witnessed by some vertex @xmath of infinite degree. Let @xmath denote
the @xmath -sequence of all @xmath which @xmath sends to @xmath . Since
@xmath is an arc, and hence sequentially compact, the sequence @xmath
has a convergent subsequence (without loss of generality the whole
sequence) with limit point @xmath . Clearly, @xmath is not an inner edge
point.

First suppose that @xmath is a vertex of @xmath and consider any basic
open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in @xmath . Without loss of
generality every @xmath is contained in this neighbourhood. Since @xmath
is the union of two half open partial edges at @xmath and every @xmath
meets @xmath precisely in @xmath , the only possibility for each @xmath
is @xmath . Hence for every @xmath we have @xmath . Then @xmath must
dominate @xmath : Assume not for a contradiction, so we find a witness
@xmath of @xmath . Pick @xmath such that @xmath holds for all @xmath .
Then all @xmath with @xmath meet @xmath by Lemma 6.2.3 , so by
pigeon-hole principle some two of them meet the same vertex of @xmath ,
a contradiction. Therefore, @xmath must dominate @xmath , so (i) holds.
In particular, @xmath admits an auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath .

Second suppose that @xmath is an end @xmath of @xmath and let @xmath
witness @xmath . Furthermore let @xmath be big enough that @xmath holds
for all @xmath . Then every @xmath with @xmath meets @xmath by Lemma
6.2.3 , so by pigeon-hole principle some two of them meet the same
vertex of @xmath , which is impossible. Hence @xmath cannot be an end.
This completes the first main case.

For the second main case suppose that @xmath is locally finite. Then by
[ 13 , Proposition 8.2.1] there is some ray @xmath in @xmath . Clearly,
we can see to it that @xmath . For every @xmath let @xmath . Define
@xmath by letting @xmath traverse @xmath from @xmath to @xmath , and set
@xmath . Then @xmath is continuous: It suffices to show continuity at 1,
so consider some basic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in @xmath and
pick @xmath such that @xmath holds for all @xmath . Since @xmath is
finite, Lemma 6.2.3 implies that only finitely many @xmath with @xmath
have points outside of @xmath . Picking @xmath bigger than these
finitely many @xmath ensures that @xmath maps @xmath to @xmath . Hence
@xmath defines a topological path from @xmath to @xmath in @xmath .
Since @xmath is compact, @xmath is Hausdorff and @xmath is a continuous
injection, it follows from general topology that @xmath is an arc (in
particular: an auxiliary arc). Thus (ii) holds and the second main case
is complete.

For the ‘Moreover’-part, it remains to show that if all of the @xmath
are tame, then so is @xmath . Since this is clear for (i) we may assume
that (ii) holds. Assume for a contradiction that @xmath is wild,
witnessed by some infinite @xmath on which @xmath induces the ordering
of the rationals. If there is some @xmath such that @xmath meets @xmath
in two distinct vertices, then @xmath is wild, which is impossible.
Hence every @xmath meets @xmath in at most one point. But then 1 is the
only accumulation point of @xmath in @xmath , a contradiction.
Therefore, @xmath is tame as claimed. ∎

###### Theorem 6.4.2.

Let @xmath be any graph, and let @xmath and @xmath be two distinct
points of @xmath . Then @xmath if and only if there exists an auxiliary
arc in from @xmath to @xmath .

###### Proof.

The backward direction holds by Lemma 6.2.4 . For the forward direction
we check several cases:

If both @xmath and @xmath are vertices of @xmath we are done by Theorem
6.3.1 , so suppose first that @xmath and @xmath . If there is some
@xmath , then @xmath implies @xmath . Hence we find an auxiliary arc
from @xmath to @xmath which we may extend to @xmath by adding the
auxiliary edge @xmath .

Otherwise @xmath is empty, so by Lemma 2.3.5 we find a sequence @xmath
of non-empty elements of @xmath such that for all @xmath the component
@xmath includes both @xmath and @xmath . In particular, the collection
of all @xmath forms a countable neighbourhood basis of @xmath in @xmath
. Since @xmath does not dominate @xmath we find some @xmath with @xmath
, and we may choose @xmath big enough that @xmath .

Now for every @xmath we wish to find some vertex @xmath in @xmath with
@xmath . Hence consider an arbitrary @xmath and suppose for a
contradiction that there is some finite set of edges @xmath which
separates @xmath from @xmath in @xmath . Then @xmath is included in some
component of @xmath which does not contain @xmath , so @xmath is a
contradiction. Therefore, no finite set of edges separates @xmath from
@xmath in @xmath . Proceeding inductively we find some infinitely many
edge-disjoint @xmath – @xmath paths in @xmath . By pigeon-hole
principle, some infinitely many of these paths agree on their endvertex
in @xmath in the same vertex, which we choose to be @xmath . In
particular, @xmath holds.

Then for all @xmath by Theorem 6.3.1 we find some auxiliary arc @xmath
from @xmath to @xmath . Furthermore, the choice of the basic open
neighbourhoods @xmath implies @xmath in @xmath . Applying Lemma 6.4.1
yields some auxiliary arc @xmath from @xmath to @xmath .

Finally suppose that both @xmath and @xmath are ends of @xmath , and
write @xmath as well as @xmath . By Lemma 3.4.6 there is some vertex
@xmath of @xmath in @xmath . Then @xmath together with the previous case
yields two auxiliary arcs, one from @xmath to @xmath and one from @xmath
to @xmath , whose union yields an auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath as
desired. ∎

#### 6.5 External @xmathTSTs: Technical preliminaries

An @xmath TST @xmath of @xmath is external if for every auxiliary
arc-component @xmath of @xmath the space @xmath is arc-connected (i.e.
@xmath is an @xmath TST of @xmath ). The idea behind this definition is
that, if we want to obtain an @xmath TST from a TST of @xmath by blowing
up its non-trivial points in @xmath to @xmath TSTs of their respective
auxiliary arc-components of @xmath , then we hope for the result to be
an @xmath TST, and if it is then of course it is an external one.

###### Corollary 6.5.1.

Let @xmath be a graph such that every end of @xmath has a countable
neighbourhood basis in @xmath . Furthermore, let @xmath and let @xmath
be an auxiliary arc-component of @xmath . Then @xmath is closed.

###### Proof.

Assume for a contradiction that there is some @xmath (with the closure
taken in @xmath ). In order to yield a contradiction, we will find an
auxiliary arc from @xmath to a point of @xmath . Clearly, @xmath must be
an end of @xmath , so we write @xmath . Let @xmath be an arbitrary point
of @xmath . Using that @xmath has a countable neighbourhood basis in
@xmath we find a sequence @xmath of points of @xmath such that @xmath
holds in @xmath . For every @xmath we pick an arc @xmath from @xmath to
@xmath in @xmath . In particular, the @xmath are auxiliary arcs. Hence
Lemma 6.4.1 yields an auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath , a
contradiction. ∎

For every @xmath and @xmath we write

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

and furthermore if @xmath is an end of @xmath we write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Lemma 6.5.2.

For every @xmath and @xmath the set @xmath is an open subset of @xmath .

###### Proof.

Since @xmath is finite and @xmath is Hausdorff, by Lemma 2.4.1 the set
@xmath is a closed subset of @xmath . Thus @xmath is an open subset of
@xmath . By Corollary 3.4.7 it is closed under @xmath . ∎

###### Corollary 6.5.3.

Let @xmath be a connected subset of @xmath . Furthermore, let @xmath and
@xmath be given such that @xmath meets both @xmath and @xmath . Then
@xmath meets @xmath .∎

###### Lemma 6.5.4.

Let @xmath be an arc in @xmath , witnessed by @xmath . Suppose that
@xmath is an accumulation point of @xmath . Then there is some unique
@xmath with @xmath converging to @xmath in that for every @xmath there
is some @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (16)
  -- -------- -- ------

###### Proof.

We start by choosing a candidate for @xmath . For this, we claim that

###### Claim 1.

For every @xmath there is some @xmath and some @xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

Assume not for a contradiction, witnessed by some @xmath . Choose @xmath
small enough that @xmath avoids the finite set @xmath . Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

holds by Lemmas 3.4.6 and 6.5.2 . By assumption, @xmath meets at least
two sets of the union on the right hand side, say for @xmath . But then
by Corollary 6.5.3 we know that @xmath meets @xmath , a contradiction. ∎

Mapping every @xmath to the unique @xmath from the claim above yields a
direction of @xmath , and hence an end @xmath of @xmath . In particular,
for every @xmath there is some @xmath such that @xmath satisfies ( 16 ).
Moreover, @xmath is unique in @xmath with this property. It remains to
show @xmath , so assume not for a contradiction and pick some finite cut
@xmath of @xmath witnessing this. Since this @xmath induces an open
neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath there is some @xmath such that @xmath
is included in this neighbourhood. For @xmath this contradicts ( 16 ). ∎

###### Lemma 6.5.5 (Arc Lifting).

Let @xmath be a countable connected graph. Suppose that for every
non-singleton auxiliary arc-component @xmath of @xmath there is some
@xmath TST @xmath of @xmath , and let @xmath be an arc in @xmath
witnessed by @xmath . Furthermore let @xmath and @xmath be given. Then
there exists an arc @xmath in @xmath from @xmath to @xmath such that
@xmath and for every non-singleton auxiliary arc-component @xmath of
@xmath exactly one of the following holds:

1.  @xmath ;

2.  @xmath is an arc in @xmath .

###### Proof.

We do not use Theorem 2.2.9 here since this would require us to ‘mix’
the spaces @xmath and @xmath .

Let @xmath be the set of all non-singleton auxiliary arc-components of
@xmath meeting @xmath . By Lemma 3.4.6 this set is countable since
@xmath is countable. Let @xmath be the function with domain @xmath which
sends every @xmath to @xmath . Denote by @xmath the set of all @xmath
which @xmath sends to a subset of some element of @xmath . For every
@xmath we let @xmath be the unique point of @xmath with @xmath . Then
@xmath is a countable set. Conversely, for each @xmath we denote by
@xmath the unique @xmath with @xmath . Write @xmath for the set of all
@xmath which are accumulation points of @xmath , and @xmath for the set
of all @xmath which are accumulation points of @xmath . For every @xmath
we define points @xmath and @xmath in @xmath as follows: If @xmath then
we let @xmath be the end of @xmath given by Lemma 6.5.4 . Else if @xmath
we set @xmath . Otherwise there is some edge @xmath of @xmath and some
@xmath such that @xmath , and we let @xmath be the endvertex of @xmath
in @xmath . Similarly, we define @xmath (with the case ‘ @xmath ’
replaced by ‘ @xmath ’). Let @xmath and choose some @xmath with @xmath .
For every @xmath we let @xmath be the unique arc in @xmath from @xmath
to @xmath and we let @xmath be a parametrisation of @xmath . Let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and recall that for every @xmath there is some @xmath with @xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

by Lemma 2.4.18 . Now we are ready to define a mapping @xmath whose
image we will take as @xmath . For this, let @xmath be given, and
suppose for the first main case that there is some @xmath with @xmath .
If @xmath is an inner edge point, we put @xmath . Else if @xmath sends
@xmath to a singleton subset @xmath of @xmath , we set @xmath (note that
we have @xmath by definition of @xmath ). Otherwise @xmath is contained
in @xmath and we set @xmath . This completes the first main case.

For the second main case suppose that @xmath is not in @xmath . Thus

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and we put

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

completing the second main case and thus the definition of @xmath .
Clearly, @xmath is injective, and for every @xmath the restriction

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

parametrises @xmath .

Put @xmath . In order to verify that @xmath is the desired arc, it
suffices to show that @xmath is a continuous injection since @xmath is
compact and @xmath is Hausdorff. For this, let an arbitrary @xmath be
given. Clearly, we may assume that @xmath is an end of @xmath , so we
write @xmath . Consider any basic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in
@xmath . We have to find an open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath which
@xmath maps to @xmath .

If we have @xmath for some @xmath we are done by the continuity of
@xmath .

Else if @xmath for some @xmath , say @xmath , then by choice of @xmath
there is some @xmath such that ( 16 ) holds, and hence @xmath maps
@xmath to @xmath . Using the continuity of @xmath yields some @xmath
such that @xmath sends the open interval @xmath to @xmath as desired.

Else if @xmath for some @xmath there is some @xmath such that ( 16 )
symmetrically holds for both sides, and hence @xmath sends @xmath to
@xmath .

Finally if @xmath is a singleton auxiliary arc-component of @xmath
meeting @xmath , then let @xmath be the point of @xmath which @xmath
maps to @xmath (Theorem 6.4.2 and Lemma 3.4.6 yield @xmath ). Now we use
the continuity of @xmath to find some @xmath such that @xmath sends
@xmath to @xmath . Then @xmath sends @xmath to @xmath as desired. ∎

###### Lemma 6.5.6.

Let @xmath be an auxiliary arc-component of @xmath and let @xmath be an
enumeration of @xmath . For every @xmath write @xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let some @xmath be given, and let @xmath be an @xmath -sequence of
arc-components @xmath of @xmath with @xmath for all @xmath . Then there
exists an end @xmath of @xmath such that @xmath .

###### Proof.

The set @xmath trivially has the finite intersection property. For every
@xmath set @xmath and let @xmath be the closure of @xmath in @xmath .
Since the set @xmath also has the finite intersection property, so does
@xmath . Using that @xmath is compact hence yields some @xmath .

First we show @xmath . Clearly, @xmath avoids @xmath , so suppose for a
contradiction that there is some @xmath in @xmath . If @xmath meets
@xmath , then @xmath and we may let @xmath be big enough that @xmath .
Then due to Lemma 6.2.3 there is some component @xmath of @xmath with
@xmath , and hence @xmath . Therefore, @xmath is an open neighbourhood
of @xmath avoiding @xmath , yielding @xmath , a contradiction. Else if
@xmath avoids @xmath , then by Theorem 6.4.2 there is a finite cut
@xmath of @xmath with sides @xmath and @xmath separating @xmath from
@xmath . Put @xmath and let @xmath be a bipartition of @xmath respecting
the sides of @xmath , i.e. with @xmath and @xmath . Without loss of
generality we have @xmath . Then @xmath , since otherwise @xmath is
basic open neighbourhood of @xmath which sends no edges to @xmath ,
contradicting Lemma 3.2.1 . Hence @xmath is an open neighbourhood of
@xmath avoiding @xmath , resulting in @xmath , a contradiction. Hence
@xmath holds as claimed.

Finally, we show that @xmath is a singleton: Assume not for a
contradiction, so we find two distinct ends @xmath and @xmath of @xmath
in @xmath . Let @xmath be a witness of @xmath and let @xmath be big
enough that @xmath . Then due to Lemma 6.2.3 the ends @xmath and @xmath
are contained in distinct auxiliary arc components of @xmath ,
contradicting @xmath . Hence @xmath is a singleton subset of @xmath . ∎

#### 6.6 @xmathTSTs of auxiliary arc-components

###### Theorem 6.6.1.

If @xmath is a countable graph, then every auxiliary arc-component of
@xmath has an @xmath TST .

###### Proof.

The proof starts with the essential idea of a proof from the lecture
course.

Let @xmath be any non-singleton auxiliary arc-component of @xmath . If
@xmath is finite, then any spanning tree of @xmath will do, so we may
assume that @xmath is infinite. Pick an enumeration @xmath of @xmath and
write @xmath for every @xmath . Furthermore, for every @xmath we write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and we let the set @xmath consist of all singleton subsets of @xmath and
all arc-components of @xmath . Then we let @xmath be the multigraph on
@xmath whose edges are the cross-edges of @xmath with respect to @xmath
. For each @xmath we denote by @xmath the arc-component of @xmath
containing @xmath (which is in @xmath by definition). Hence @xmath can
be obtained from @xmath by discarding @xmath and adding @xmath as well
as the arc-components of

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Next, we inductively construct spanning trees @xmath of the @xmath ,
starting with the spanning tree @xmath of @xmath . For the induction
step, informally we obtain @xmath from @xmath by expanding the vertex
@xmath of @xmath to a star in @xmath with centre @xmath and leaves the
arc-components of @xmath . Formally, we proceed as follows: Let @xmath
be the subgraph of @xmath whose 1-complex coincides with @xmath where
the closure is taken in the 1-complex of @xmath (i.e. @xmath is the
subgraph of @xmath induced by the inner edge points of @xmath ). Then we
let @xmath be the union of @xmath and an arbitrary spanning star of
@xmath (recall that @xmath is the set consisting of @xmath and the
arc-components of @xmath ). It is easy to see that @xmath is a spanning
tree of @xmath . Note that, by construction, for every @xmath we have
that every @xmath sends to each arc-component of @xmath at most one edge
of @xmath . As a consequence, every arc-component of @xmath has finite
degree in @xmath .

Finally, we let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which will turn out to be our desired @xmath TST of @xmath . The rest of
the proof is dedicated to a formal verification. By definition, @xmath
is a standard subspace of @xmath . First, we show that @xmath is
‘spanning’:

###### Claim 1.

If @xmath is an auxiliary arc component of @xmath for some @xmath then
either @xmath meets @xmath or @xmath for some @xmath .

###### Proof of the Claim.

If @xmath avoids @xmath then @xmath also avoids @xmath , so @xmath .
Then @xmath must be a singleton: Otherwise there is some @xmath . Pick a
witness @xmath of @xmath . Then @xmath meets @xmath by Lemma 6.2.3 , a
contradiction. ∎

###### Claim 2.

@xmath .

###### Proof of the Claim.

By construction we have @xmath . Let any @xmath be given; we have to
show @xmath .

If for every @xmath the auxiliary arc-component @xmath of @xmath
containing @xmath meets @xmath we have @xmath : Indeed, consider any
basic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in @xmath and pick @xmath big
enough such that @xmath . Then @xmath by Lemma 6.2.3 . Due to our
assumption we know that @xmath meets @xmath . Hence @xmath holds. Since
@xmath is closed and @xmath we also have @xmath .

Otherwise there is some @xmath which avoids @xmath and hence @xmath . By
Claim 1 we have @xmath , so @xmath includes the interior of an
auxiliary-edge @xmath from @xmath to @xmath and @xmath witnesses @xmath
. ∎

Thus @xmath is ‘spanning’. Next, we show that @xmath is arc-connected:

###### Claim 3.

For every @xmath there exists an arc from @xmath to @xmath in @xmath .

###### Proof of the Claim.

For every @xmath there exists a unique path @xmath from @xmath to @xmath
. Let @xmath be an arc traversing @xmath (i.e. formally @xmath is the
1-complex of the graph @xmath ). For every @xmath we define @xmath as
follows: If @xmath is a point of @xmath which is also a point of @xmath
we put @xmath . Else if @xmath is not a point of @xmath , then @xmath
formally is one of the following:

1.  the singleton @xmath ;

2.  an inner edge point of an auxiliary edge from @xmath to an
    arc-component of @xmath ;

3.  an arc-component of @xmath .

In either case we let @xmath map @xmath to @xmath , which formally is a
point of @xmath . Note that @xmath is a connected subset of (the
1-complex of) @xmath and @xmath is a continuous surjection. The arcs
@xmath together with the maps @xmath form an inverse sequence @xmath
whose inverse limit @xmath is an arc by Theorem 2.2.9 . We have to
translate this arc into an auxiliary arc.

For this, we define @xmath as follows: Let any @xmath be given. If there
is some @xmath such that @xmath is an inner edge point, then we put
@xmath . Else if there are some naturals @xmath and @xmath such that
@xmath , then we put @xmath . Both cases are well defined by definition
of the @xmath . For the final case suppose that @xmath is an auxiliary
arc-component of @xmath for every @xmath . Then @xmath holds for all
@xmath by definition of the bonding maps and we set @xmath for the end
@xmath of @xmath with @xmath which exists by Lemma 6.5.6 . This
completes the definition of @xmath .

Let @xmath witness that @xmath is an arc. In order to show that @xmath
is an arc it suffices to show that @xmath is a continuous injection
since @xmath is compact and @xmath is Hausdorff. Clearly, @xmath is
injective. Since @xmath is continuous, it suffices to show that @xmath
is continuous. For this, let @xmath be any point of @xmath and let
@xmath be any basic open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath .

If there exists some @xmath such that @xmath is not an arc-component of
@xmath , then @xmath easily translates into an open neighbourhood @xmath
of @xmath in @xmath . Letting @xmath for all @xmath with @xmath and
@xmath results in the desired open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath .

Otherwise for every @xmath the point @xmath is an arc-component of
@xmath , and @xmath is an end @xmath of @xmath by construction. In
particular, @xmath is of the form @xmath for some @xmath . Let @xmath be
big enough that @xmath . Then Lemma 6.2.3 implies @xmath . Recall that
@xmath is a vertex of the path @xmath . Due to @xmath there exist two
distinct auxiliary edges @xmath and @xmath such that @xmath is a
homeomorphic copy of @xmath in @xmath . Clearly, this set includes an
open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in @xmath such that @xmath holds. In
particular, letting @xmath for all @xmath with @xmath and @xmath results
in an open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath which @xmath sends to @xmath .
∎

###### Claim 4.

If @xmath is an arc in @xmath which meets two distinct auxiliary
arc-components of @xmath , then @xmath meets @xmath .

###### Proof of the Claim.

If not, then @xmath also avoids @xmath . Hence there exists a unique
arc-component of @xmath including @xmath , a contradiction. ∎

###### Claim 5.

For every @xmath and every arc-component @xmath of @xmath : if @xmath is
an arc in @xmath meeting @xmath and @xmath , then @xmath meets @xmath .

###### Proof of the Claim.

Let @xmath be a parametrisation of @xmath , without loss of generality
with @xmath and @xmath . Since @xmath is a closed subset of @xmath by
Lemma 6.5.1 there is a maximal @xmath with @xmath . By Claim 4 we know
that @xmath meets @xmath , so since @xmath is finite there is some
minimal @xmath with @xmath . Again by Claim 4 and by choice of both
@xmath and @xmath we know that @xmath avoids @xmath . Hence @xmath is a
connected subset of @xmath . In particular, there is an auxiliary edge
@xmath in @xmath with @xmath , so @xmath follows. Write @xmath with
@xmath and @xmath . Due to @xmath , the only possibility for @xmath and
@xmath is @xmath and @xmath . Therefore, we have @xmath as desired. ∎

###### Claim 6.

For every end @xmath of @xmath in @xmath there exists an arc from @xmath
to @xmath in @xmath .

###### Proof of the Claim.

We check two main cases.

For the first main case suppose that for every @xmath the auxiliary
arc-component @xmath of @xmath containing @xmath meets @xmath in some
@xmath . Then we use Claim 3 to find an auxiliary arc @xmath from @xmath
to @xmath in @xmath for every @xmath . We have @xmath in @xmath :
Consider any basic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in @xmath and let
@xmath be big enough that @xmath . Then Lemma 6.2.3 yields @xmath which
implies @xmath for all @xmath . If Lemma 6.4.1 yields an auxiliary arc
from @xmath to @xmath included in @xmath then we are done. Otherwise
Lemma 6.4.1 yields some @xmath and a vertex @xmath on @xmath which is
the centre of an infinite star of auxiliary arcs included in @xmath and
with leaves in @xmath . But then Claim 5 applied to the infinitely many
arcs from @xmath to the @xmath in that fan implies that @xmath is a
vertex of @xmath with infinite degree in @xmath , which is impossible
(as argued at the end of the construction of the trees @xmath ).

For the second main case suppose that there is some @xmath such that
@xmath avoids @xmath . Then @xmath holds by Claim 1 , so @xmath includes
the interior of some auxiliary edge from some @xmath to @xmath . If
@xmath we are done. Otherwise, by Claim 3 there is an auxiliary arc from
@xmath to @xmath in @xmath , which @xmath extends to an auxiliary arc
from @xmath to @xmath in @xmath . ∎

Thus, @xmath is arc-connected.

###### Claim 7.

@xmath is acirclic.

###### Proof of the Claim.

Suppose for a contradiction that @xmath contains a circle @xmath . By
Lemma 6.2.5 we know that @xmath traverses an auxiliary-edge, so in
particular @xmath contains a vertex of @xmath . Let @xmath be minimal
with @xmath . Then @xmath avoids @xmath . Let @xmath be an auxiliary
edge at @xmath which @xmath traverses, and let @xmath be the auxiliary
arc-component of @xmath containing the other endvertex of @xmath (which
exists by choice of @xmath ). Now consider the arc @xmath . Since @xmath
meets both @xmath and @xmath , Claim 5 together with the choice of
@xmath yields that @xmath traverses some @xmath . But then we have
@xmath , i.e. @xmath has two parallel edges, contradicting the fact that
@xmath is a spanning tree of @xmath . ∎

This completes the proof that @xmath is an @xmath TST of @xmath . ∎

#### 6.7 Tree-packing

A circle in @xmath is a homeomorphic copy of the unit circle. If @xmath
is a subgraph of @xmath , then the closure of @xmath in @xmath where
@xmath is the equivalence class used to obtain @xmath from @xmath (cf.
Section 2.5 ) is said to be a standard subspace of @xmath . Clearly,
every circle in @xmath is a standard subspace. A standard subspace of
@xmath is said to be spanning if it includes @xmath . A topological
spanning tree (TST) of @xmath is a uniquely arc-connected spanning
standard subspace of @xmath . These definitions are equivalent to those
of Miraftab [ 22 , Chapter 5] . ³⁶ ³⁶ 36 Note that Miraftab writes
@xmath for @xmath .

###### Lemma 6.7.1 ([22, Lemma 22]).

Suppose that @xmath is a countable connected graph. A standard subspace
@xmath of @xmath is arc-connected if and only if @xmath contains an edge
from every finite cut of @xmath of which it meets both sides (taken in
@xmath ).

###### Lemma 6.7.2.

Suppose that @xmath is a countable connected graph. If for every finite
partition of @xmath , into @xmath sets say, @xmath has at least @xmath
cross-edges, then @xmath has @xmath edge-disjoint arc-connected spanning
standard subspaces.

###### Proof.

This easily follows from mimicking the proof of [ 13 , Lemma 8.5.8]
where we replace

1.  the @xmath by the @xmath from the inverse system @xmath ,

2.  [ 13 , Lemma 8.5.5] by Lemma 6.7.1 ,

3.  [ 13 , Lemma 8.1.2] by Lemma 2.2.4 ,

and finally use Lemma 3.4.11 for @xmath . ∎

The following Lemma can be proved analogously to [ 13 , Lemma 8.5.9]
(with [ 13 , Lemma 8.5.5] replaced by Lemma 6.7.1 in the proof):

###### Lemma 6.7.3 (@xmath).

Suppose that @xmath is a countable connected graph. Then every connected
spanning standard subspace of @xmath includes a TST of @xmath .∎

###### Theorem 6.7.4.

Let @xmath be a countable connected graph. ³⁷ ³⁷ 37 Multigraph should
not be a problem. Then the following are equivalent for all @xmath :

1.  @xmath has @xmath external @xmath TST s which are edge-disjoint on
    @xmath .

2.  @xmath has at least @xmath edges across any finite vertex partition
    @xmath .

###### Proof.

(i) @xmath (ii). Using Lemma 6.2.4 this holds by the same argumentation
as in the proof of [ 13 , Theorem 8.5.7] .

(ii) @xmath (i). For this proof we treat @xmath as @xmath (recall
Theorem 3.4.14 ). Applying Lemmas 6.7.2 and 6.7.3 yields @xmath
edge-disjoint TSTs @xmath of @xmath . Let @xmath be the set of all
non-singleton auxiliary arc-components of @xmath . For every @xmath we
apply Theorem 6.6.1 to find an @xmath TST @xmath of @xmath , and for
each @xmath we set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then every @xmath is acirclic: Assume not for a contradiction, witnessed
by some circle @xmath .

If @xmath avoids all finite cuts of @xmath , then @xmath being connected
together with Lemma 6.2.4 yields @xmath for some @xmath , which is
impossible.

Otherwise @xmath meets some finite cut @xmath of @xmath in some edge
@xmath . Then @xmath is an arc in @xmath . By Lemma 6.2.4 we know that
@xmath satisfies the premise of Lemma 6.7.1 , so @xmath is still
connected which is impossible. Thus @xmath is acirclic.

Furthermore, every @xmath is arc-connected: For this, let any two
distinct points @xmath and @xmath of @xmath be given (without loss of
generality none of @xmath and @xmath is in @xmath ). If @xmath , then by
Theorem 6.4.2 there is some @xmath containing @xmath and @xmath , so we
find an arc from @xmath to @xmath in @xmath and hence in @xmath .
Otherwise @xmath holds, and we let @xmath be an arc in @xmath from
@xmath to @xmath . Then Lemma 6.5.5 lifts @xmath to an arc from @xmath
to @xmath in @xmath . ∎

###### Corollary 6.7.5.

Every countable connected graph has an @xmath TST .∎

#### 6.8 Outlook: limit thin sums

While we managed to construct auxiliary arcs without imposing any
cardinality bounds on @xmath , we proved tree-packing only for countable
connected @xmath . On the one hand, this is needed for the Arc Lifting
Lemma ( 6.5.5 ) to work. But on the other hand we used it to obtain
@xmath TSTs of auxiliary arc-components of @xmath , and we would like to
know whether these exist for arbitrary @xmath , too. Also, we would like
to know whether there is a connection to dendrites.

There exist various obstructions to naive generalisations of thins sums
of circles. For example, if @xmath is just a dominated ray embedded into
the plane, and if our thin family consists of all the (inner) facial
cycles of @xmath , then their sum should yield the ray plus the sole
auxiliary edge since the ray itself is an NST and hence induces an
@xmath TST. Hence we could modify the definition of a thin sum in that
we also add certain auxiliary edges. For example, if @xmath has no
ultrafilter tangles, and if @xmath is a thin family of circuits, then a
candidate for such a thin sum could be

On the other hand, investigation of @xmath from the next section should
be prioritised.

## Part II Partial results

### 7 A tangle Hausdorff compactification

The introduction of Chapter 6 motivated the auxiliary space @xmath after
motivating the Hausdorff compactification @xmath . Hence in this
chapter, we immediately begin with the formal construction of @xmath .

#### 7.1 Construction

Recall section 4 . For every @xmath and @xmath put

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and for each @xmath put

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Furthermore, for every @xmath we denote by @xmath the finite partition
of @xmath induced by @xmath and the singleton subsets of @xmath . Let
@xmath be the graph on @xmath with edge set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The edges in @xmath are the limit edges . For every @xmath we let @xmath
be the multigraph on @xmath whose edges are precisely the cross-edges of
@xmath with respect to @xmath . Vertices of @xmath that are singleton
subsets @xmath of @xmath we consider to be vertices of @xmath and refer
to them as @xmath ; the other vertices of @xmath are its dummy vertices
. Now we let @xmath be the topological space obtained from the ground
set of the 1-complex of @xmath by endowing it with the topology
generated by the following basis:

For every @xmath and @xmath we choose @xmath . For every inner edge
point of an edge that is an edge of @xmath we choose the usual open
neighbourhoods. For every dummy vertex @xmath of @xmath and every @xmath
we choose as open the set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If @xmath is an inner edge point of an edge @xmath with @xmath , i.e.
there is some @xmath and some @xmath with @xmath , then for every @xmath
with @xmath and every finite @xmath we declare as open the set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

also see Fig. 14 .

###### Lemma 7.1.1.

@xmath is a compact Hausdorff topological space for every @xmath .

For every @xmath we define a bonding map @xmath which sends the vertices
of @xmath to the vertices of @xmath including them; which is the
identity on the edges of @xmath that are also edges of @xmath ; and
which sends any other edge of @xmath to the dummy vertex of @xmath that
contains both its endvertices in @xmath .

###### Lemma 7.1.2.

The @xmath are continuous.

By Lemmas 7.1.1 and 2.2.3 the inverse limit

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is compact Hausdorff.

#### 7.2 Outlook

Call a continuum @xmath TST-like if for every two distinct points @xmath
and @xmath of @xmath the set @xmath endowed with the subspace topology
is a subcontinuum of @xmath . Recall that, by Theorem 2.4.8 the space
@xmath is linearly ordered by its separation ordering, and by Theorem
2.4.9 the subspace topology on @xmath coincides with its order topology.
If @xmath is a subgraph of @xmath where each @xmath is incident with a
limit edge in @xmath , then we write @xmath for its closure in @xmath
and call this closure a standard subspace . If @xmath is any graph and
@xmath is a standard subspace of @xmath with @xmath , then we say that
@xmath is spanning . A TST of @xmath is a spanning standard subspace of
@xmath that is also a TST-like subcontinuum of @xmath . A circle @xmath
of @xmath is a subcontinuum of @xmath such that @xmath is disconnected
for every two distinct points @xmath and @xmath of @xmath . ³⁸ ³⁸ 38 We
should not need the additional requirement that @xmath be connected: an
arc minus its two endpoints is still connected, and hence not a circle.

###### Conjecture 7.2.1.

If @xmath is any graph, then @xmath admits a TST.

###### Idea.

By transfinite usage of Theorem 2.4.6 we can find a subcontinuum @xmath
of @xmath such that

1.  @xmath .

2.  For every edge @xmath of @xmath the space @xmath is disconnected.

Finally, use Theorem 2.4.7 to find a subcontinuum @xmath of @xmath which
is irreducible about @xmath . It remains to show that @xmath is a
TST-like standard subspace of @xmath . (If @xmath is not standard, a
transfinite approach should work instead of Theorem 2.4.7 , but here we
have to remove open neighbourhoods of inner edge points of limit edges
with @xmath and @xmath .) ∎

### 8 ETop and the maximal Hausdorff quotient

#### 8.1 Introduction

Since for connected graphs @xmath the quotient @xmath is a Hausdorff
quotient of @xmath with @xmath by Theorem 3.4.14 , one might ask whether
it is the maximal Hausdorff quotient of @xmath . In this chapter, we
study for which graphs @xmath the space @xmath is the maximal Hausdorff
quotient of the tangle compactification. In order to keep things to the
point, we introduce some notation first: Recall that the relation @xmath
is defined on @xmath by letting @xmath whenever there exist no two
disjoint open neighbourhoods of @xmath and @xmath in @xmath , and @xmath
denotes the transitive closure of @xmath . Since @xmath is an
equivalence relation, we write @xmath for the quotient space @xmath .
The equivalence relation @xmath on @xmath satisfying @xmath is given by
Theorem 2.4.16 . Due to Corollary 3.4.4 , the minimality of @xmath and
the definition of @xmath we have

###### Lemma 8.1.1.

@xmath holds for every graph @xmath .∎

Now we are ready to start: Of course, the first question that comes to
mind, is whether there even exist graphs for which @xmath is not the
maximal Hausdorff quotient, i.e. for which @xmath is a proper subset of
@xmath . Surprisingly, a long known example graph positively answers
this question:

The graph @xmath from [ 8 , Fig. 6] , also pictured in Fig. 15 here,
originally served as an example of a non-finitely separable graph on
which the relation used to obtain ITop as a quotient of VTop is an
equivalence relation (i.e. for which ITop is well-defined even though
@xmath is not finitely separable) and which has no topological spanning
tree with respect to ITop . Even more strikingly, in ITop this graph
admits an edgeless Hamilton circle (which witnesses the absence of
topological spanning trees, see [ 8 , Proposition 3.4 and Corollary 3.5]
for details). In this graph, @xmath identifies every two points of
@xmath , whereas ITop identified every vertex with the two ends it
dominates. Unsurprisingly, @xmath identifies the same points as ITop
did:

Clearly, it suffices to show that this graph has no ultrafilter tangles.
For this, consider any @xmath . Then @xmath is finite: Indeed, let
@xmath be the union of @xmath and the first @xmath levels of the
underlying binary tree of @xmath , where @xmath is big enough that
@xmath is included in @xmath . Now @xmath is easily seen to be finite,
and so @xmath must be finite. Hence every @xmath is finite, so @xmath
has no ultrafilter tangles as claimed.

By arguments similar to an exercise from the lectures, it follows that
@xmath is Hausdorff (we shifted the proof to the end of the
introduction):

###### Lemma 8.1.2 (@xmath).

There is a connected graph with @xmath .

Furthermore, the edgeless Hamilton circle from ITop also is one in
@xmath , so @xmath has no TST either. All in all, this graph shows a
sufficiently rich structure of finite vertex separators branching in a
binary tree like way (the separators of the form @xmath with @xmath a
vertex of the NST @xmath of @xmath given by the underlying binary tree
plus the edge @xmath ) can force @xmath even though the graph does not
have a single finite cut.

So @xmath and @xmath in general do not coincide. As a @xmath shows,
@xmath in general is not transitive, but maybe @xmath coincides with
@xmath for every graph? An easy example shows that this is not the case:

If @xmath is an undominated end of an arbitrary graph, then clearly
@xmath holds. The graph @xmath pictured above shows that @xmath is
possible: Indeed, @xmath holds while @xmath and @xmath agree on the
vertex set of @xmath . Thus @xmath turns this graph into hawaiian
earrings and @xmath does the same except for @xmath which does not get
identified with any other point. Taking a closer look reveals that
@xmath is not closed in @xmath , witnessed by @xmath , so @xmath is not
even T @xmath by Lemma 2.4.1 . Meanwhile, @xmath and @xmath coincide.

So if the @xmath -classes in general are not closed, then perhaps taking
their closures might suffice? If (by abuse of notation) we define @xmath
to be the relation on @xmath with @xmath whenever there is some @xmath
-class whose closure in @xmath contains both @xmath and @xmath , then
the following example shows that neither of @xmath and its transitive
closure do suffice:

Indeed, if @xmath is the graph pictured in Fig. 17 , then the @xmath is
not an equivalence relation: For every double ray of heavy edges, its
vertices of infinite degree (in @xmath ) form a @xmath -class, and these
are the only non-trivial @xmath -classes, so every end @xmath with
@xmath lies in the closure of two distinct @xmath -classes. Thus, the
only non-trivial equivalence class of the transitive closure of @xmath
consist of all vertices of @xmath of infinite degree together with all
ends @xmath ( @xmath ). Since the end @xmath is excluded from this
class, the quotient @xmath fails to be T @xmath .

As described in the preliminaries of Theorem 2.4.17 , it is possible to
obtain @xmath from @xmath via a transfinite construction. The graph from
Fig. 17 can also be used to show that there exists no ordinal @xmath
such that @xmath holds for every graph @xmath (where @xmath is defined
in Section 2.4 ). Indeed, assume for a contradiction that there is such
an @xmath , and let @xmath be the graph pictured in Fig. 17 . Put @xmath
. For every @xmath there is a subgraph @xmath corresponding to @xmath
just like the red subgraph of @xmath corresponds to @xmath . To obtain
the graph @xmath from @xmath we replace the red subgraph @xmath of
@xmath with a copy of @xmath where the vertices @xmath and @xmath of the
copy take over the roles of @xmath and @xmath of the original @xmath ,
respectively, and we do the same for every other @xmath . Next we obtain
@xmath from @xmath by replacing the @xmath of each copy of @xmath that
was added in the previous construction step in the same way. Proceeding
inductively, we arrive at a graph @xmath for which @xmath is not
Hausdorff, contradicting our assumption.

Now that all straightforward attempts starting ‘from below’ with @xmath
failed and the graph from Fig. 17 showed that a sufficiently rich
structure can result in @xmath , we will try a different approach.
Readers who attended a talk by Diestel about the discovery of
topological infinite graph theory already noticed that every example
graph from this introduction is based on a graph which occurred in his
talks. In these talk, the examples led to the definition of a circle and
the usage of arcs instead of (graph-)paths. So, perhaps some sort of
special arcs might describe the @xmath -classes?

For the example graphs from Fig. 18 this does not work: If @xmath is the
left graph, then every arc (in @xmath ) from the sole end of @xmath to
its dominating vertex must visit some vertex of finite degree.
Similarly, every arc between the two vertices of infinite degree of the
right graph must visit some vertex of finite degree. Furthermore,
arc-constructions in graphs that are not locally finite face various
problems. But, what if we enrich @xmath with some auxiliary structure
reflecting our intuition? Let us have a second look at the example
graphs discussed so far, but this time we draw in auxiliary arcs (using
grey):

For the simple examples things look fine, and after choosing a more
convenient drawing, the edgeless Hamilton circle from Fig. 15 can be
visualised by an auxiliary Hamilton circle:

We have already seen that for the graph @xmath from Figures 15 and 22
the quotient @xmath is not the maximal Hausdorff quotient of @xmath . In
fact, we shall see later that auxiliary arc components describe
precisely the @xmath -classes. But not all is lost: The auxiliary
Hamilton circle failing to describe the @xmath -classes is wild, while
the auxiliary arcs from our other examples are all tame. ³⁹ ³⁹ 39 Recall
that an arc is called wild if it induces on some subset of its vertices
the ordering of the rationals, and tame otherwise. So perhaps we can use
this in order to characterise the graphs with @xmath ?

I did not succeed in finding a combinatorial characterisation of the
graphs @xmath satisfying @xmath . However, as our main contribution we
at least present sufficient combinatorial conditions. In Section 8.5 we
will discuss the main difficulty prohibiting me from giving a
combinatorial characterisation. Basically, the difficulty lies in
describing a limit property (here: wild and tame), which excludes naive
inverse limit approaches right from the start.

Before we continue, we give a proof of a fact we used earlier:

###### Proof of Lemma 8.1.2.

Let @xmath be the graph from Fig. 15 , and consider @xmath for
simplicity. Furthermore, let @xmath be the underlying binary tree of
@xmath , and note that it is an NST of @xmath (with root @xmath ). It
suffices to verify that @xmath is Hausdorff. Therefore, let @xmath be
given. We have to find disjoint open neighbourhoods of @xmath and @xmath
in @xmath which are @xmath -closed. Since the only non-trivial @xmath
-classes are of the form @xmath with @xmath a vertex of @xmath , without
loss of generality we may assume that @xmath and @xmath are vertices of
@xmath . Let @xmath map each 0-1 sequence (finite or infinite) to its
naturally corresponding value in @xmath , and let @xmath map every end
@xmath to the image of the binary sequence induced by @xmath under the
map @xmath . We check two cases:

First suppose that @xmath and @xmath are incomparable with respect to
@xmath . Then we define an open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in @xmath
by taking the union of @xmath with the following choices of sets: for
every @xmath choose

  -- -------- -------- --
              @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Similarly, we define @xmath . These clearly are disjoint and @xmath
-closed.

Now suppose that @xmath and @xmath are comparable with respect to @xmath
with @xmath , say. Without loss of generality suppose that the first
digit of the 0-1 sequence @xmath after @xmath is 1 (the other case
follows by symmetry). Next, we pick some @xmath and let @xmath be some
normal ray in @xmath whose end in @xmath corresponds to @xmath . In
particular there are some @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath . For every
@xmath we define @xmath as follows: If @xmath we let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath otherwise. Similarly, for every @xmath we define @xmath as
follows: If @xmath we let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath otherwise. Furthermore, for every @xmath we let @xmath denote

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and similarly for every @xmath we let @xmath denote

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Finally let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for @xmath . Clearly, @xmath and @xmath are open and disjoint. We show
that @xmath is @xmath -closed (then @xmath will be @xmath -closed by an
analogue argument).

For this, we first show that if @xmath is an end in @xmath dominated by
a vertex @xmath then @xmath is also in @xmath . If @xmath is in some
@xmath , then clearly @xmath holds. Otherwise @xmath is an end in some
@xmath . If @xmath then we are done, so suppose not. Due to @xmath the
normal ray @xmath of @xmath starts with @xmath and @xmath is in @xmath
since @xmath is normal. Pick @xmath with @xmath . By @xmath we have
@xmath . The only two possibilities for @xmath are @xmath and @xmath ,
but the first case is impossible due to @xmath and choice of @xmath , so
we have @xmath . Since the sequence @xmath is an initial segment of
@xmath this yields @xmath as desired. Thus we have @xmath as claimed.

Second, we show that if @xmath is a vertex in @xmath dominating an end
@xmath then @xmath is also in @xmath . Since @xmath and @xmath represent
the same rational and by the construction of @xmath , it suffices to
show that the ends in @xmath correspond to @xmath , i.e. that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since “ @xmath ” is clear we show “ @xmath ”. Given any @xmath pick
@xmath with @xmath and let @xmath be maximal with @xmath . Then @xmath
implies @xmath . If @xmath then @xmath for some @xmath due to @xmath .
Otherwise @xmath and @xmath holds.

Since the only non-trivial @xmath -classes are of the form @xmath it
follows from the two claims above that @xmath is @xmath -closed. ∎

#### 8.2 A first sufficient combinatorial condition

Call a graph @xmath simply-branching if @xmath and @xmath agree on
@xmath . This is a combinatorial definition since Corollary 3.2.5
combinatorially describes @xmath on @xmath .

###### Example 8.2.1.

The graph pictured in Fig. 16 is simply-branching, while the graphs from
Figs. 17 and 15 are not.

###### Proposition 8.2.2.

Let @xmath be a simply-branching graph with finitely many components.
Then @xmath .

###### Proof.

We show @xmath . Recall that @xmath is Hausdorff by Corollary 3.4.4 , so
@xmath holds by minimality of @xmath . Assume for a contradiction that
@xmath holds, and pick any two distinct points @xmath witnessing this,
i.e. with @xmath and @xmath . Since @xmath and @xmath agree on @xmath ,
either @xmath meets @xmath and @xmath , or both @xmath and @xmath are in
@xmath . We thus check two main cases:

For the first main case suppose @xmath and @xmath , say. Write @xmath
and @xmath . We check two subcases:

First suppose @xmath and pick any @xmath which exists since @xmath has
only finitely many components. Thus @xmath holds by Lemma 3.2.1 , and
furthermore @xmath implies @xmath . In particular @xmath , so @xmath is
a contradiction.

For the second subcase suppose @xmath and write @xmath . If @xmath is
dominated by any vertex @xmath then clearly @xmath as well as @xmath ,
yielding @xmath , a contradiction. So we may assume that @xmath is
undominated. By Lemma 2.4.1 it suffices to show that @xmath lies in the
closure of @xmath in @xmath to yield @xmath . Applying Lemma 2.3.5 to
the undominated end @xmath of @xmath yields a sequence @xmath of
non-empty elements of @xmath such that for all @xmath the component
@xmath includes both @xmath and @xmath . Furthermore, the collection
@xmath is a countable neighbourhood basis of @xmath in @xmath . Since
@xmath is undominated, we may assume that @xmath is not in @xmath . By
Lemma 3.4.7 we know that every @xmath meets @xmath in some vertex @xmath
, so in particular every @xmath meets @xmath since @xmath implies @xmath
by assumption. Thus every @xmath meets @xmath as desired, resulting in
@xmath , a contradiction. This completes the second subcase and the
first main case.

Now suppose both @xmath and @xmath are in @xmath and write @xmath . We
will check two subcases:

First suppose @xmath and @xmath , say. As before, pick @xmath and note
@xmath as well as @xmath . Hence @xmath , since otherwise @xmath is a
contradiction. But then we derive a contradiction for @xmath and @xmath
from the second subcase of the first main case.

For the second subcase suppose both @xmath are in @xmath . Since @xmath
there is some vertex @xmath by Lemma 3.4.6 . Then @xmath by the second
subcase of the first main case, a contradiction. ∎

#### 8.3 Auxiliary arcs and the maximal Hausdorff quotient

An arc is called wild if it induces on some subset of @xmath the
ordering of the rationals, and tame otherwise. Let @xmath be a function
with domain @xmath that is the identity on @xmath and which assigns some
element of @xmath to @xmath for every @xmath . We define the equivalence
relation @xmath on @xmath by letting @xmath whenever there is some tame
auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath or @xmath . ⁴⁰ ⁴⁰ 40 One special
case which led to this definition is the following: If @xmath is such
that @xmath then our definition must ensure @xmath . By Theorem 3.3.5
the equivalence relation @xmath is well defined.

Next, we introduce a definition which helps us in that it describes
‘good’ open subsets of @xmath . Suppose that @xmath is an equivalence
relation on @xmath . An open subset @xmath of @xmath which is closed
under @xmath is called @xmath - standard if it satisfies the following
three conditions for every edge @xmath of @xmath :

1.  If @xmath contains both endvertices of @xmath , then also @xmath .

2.  If @xmath contains exactly one endvertex of @xmath , say @xmath ,
    then @xmath .

3.  If @xmath avoids both endvertices of @xmath , then @xmath also
    avoids @xmath .

Every open subset @xmath of @xmath which is @xmath -closed induces an
@xmath -standard subset @xmath of @xmath , where @xmath is the union of
the following choice of sets:

For every @xmath choose @xmath .

For every @xmath let @xmath be a basic open neighbourhood included in
@xmath , and choose @xmath .

For every edge @xmath of @xmath we check three cases: If both
endvertices of @xmath are in @xmath , then we choose @xmath . Else if
precisely one endvertex of @xmath is in @xmath , say @xmath , then we
choose @xmath . Otherwise no endvertex of @xmath is in @xmath and we
choose the empty set.

For every auxiliary edge @xmath with one endvertex in @xmath we know
that both endvertices must be in @xmath , and hence we choose @xmath .

This completes the definition of @xmath .

###### Observation 8.3.1.

If @xmath is an open subset of @xmath which is @xmath -closed, then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If @xmath and @xmath are two disjoint open subsets of @xmath which are
@xmath -closed, then @xmath and @xmath are disjoint.

###### Lemma 8.3.2.

Let @xmath and @xmath be two vertices of @xmath with @xmath and let
@xmath be an auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath . Then there is a
vertex @xmath distinct from @xmath and @xmath with @xmath .

###### Proof.

Put @xmath . By Observation 8.3.1 we find two disjoint @xmath -standard
neighbourhoods @xmath of @xmath and @xmath of @xmath in @xmath . Since
@xmath is connected there is some point @xmath . In particular, @xmath
holds.

If @xmath is a vertex of @xmath we are done.

Else if @xmath is an inner edge point of some edge @xmath of @xmath ,
then @xmath must be an auxiliary edge with endvertices @xmath and @xmath
, say. In particular, one of @xmath and @xmath is a vertex of @xmath ,
say @xmath . Since @xmath and @xmath are @xmath -standard, @xmath
implies that all of @xmath avoids @xmath , so we are done with @xmath .

Finally assume that @xmath is an end of @xmath and write @xmath . Next,
let @xmath be the complete graph on @xmath . For every edge @xmath of
@xmath we use Observation 8.3.1 to yield two disjoint @xmath -standard
neighbourhoods @xmath of @xmath and @xmath of @xmath in @xmath . Then we
let @xmath be the intersection over all sets @xmath where @xmath is an
edge of @xmath at @xmath . By Lemma 6.2.5 we find some auxiliary edge
@xmath of @xmath together with some @xmath . Then @xmath is in both
@xmath and @xmath by choice of @xmath . Since both of these are @xmath
-standard, both contain the endvertices of @xmath , and so does @xmath .
Then one of the endvertices of @xmath is a vertex of @xmath in @xmath ,
and this vertex can take on the role of @xmath by choice of @xmath . ∎

###### Corollary 8.3.3.

Let @xmath and @xmath be two distinct vertices of a graph @xmath with
@xmath . Then every auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath is wild.

###### Proof.

By Lemma 8.3.2 between every two distinct vertices @xmath and @xmath of
@xmath on @xmath with @xmath there is a vertex @xmath of @xmath on
@xmath with @xmath . Iterating this lemma, starting with @xmath and
@xmath , yields a subset of @xmath on which @xmath induces the ordering
of the rationals. ∎

###### Lemma 8.3.4.

For every graph @xmath we have @xmath on @xmath .

###### Proof.

Assume not for a contradiction, witnessed by two distinct vertices
@xmath and @xmath , i.e. with @xmath and @xmath . Pick a tame auxiliary
arc @xmath from @xmath to @xmath witnessing @xmath . Then the existence
of @xmath contradicts Corollary 8.3.3 . ∎

###### Lemma 8.3.5.

If @xmath is a graph such that every auxiliary arc is tame, then @xmath
holds on @xmath .

###### Proof.

Suppose that two distinct vertices @xmath and @xmath of @xmath are given
with @xmath . Then @xmath holds by Lemma 8.1.1 . Using Theorem 6.3.1 we
find an auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath , which is tame by
assumption, so we have @xmath . ∎

###### Lemma 8.3.6.

Let @xmath be a graph with finitely many components such that every
auxiliary arc is tame. Then @xmath holds.

###### Proof.

By Lemmas 8.3.4 & 8.3.5 together with Theorem 6.3.1 we know that

1.   The three equivalence relations @xmath , @xmath and @xmath agree on
    @xmath .

We show “ @xmath ”.

“ @xmath ”. This follows from Corollary 3.4.4 and minimality of @xmath .

“ @xmath ”. Let @xmath be given with @xmath . We check several cases:

If both @xmath and @xmath are in @xmath , then we are done by Theorem
6.4.2 combined with the assumption that all auxiliary arcs are tame.

Next, suppose that @xmath is a vertex of @xmath and @xmath is an
ultrafilter tangle, and write @xmath and @xmath . Then we pick some
@xmath . Recall that @xmath holds by Lemma 3.2.1 , so “ @xmath ” implies
@xmath . In particular, @xmath holds, which implies @xmath , and hence
@xmath by @xmath . By definition of @xmath , this yields @xmath .

Now suppose that @xmath is an ultrafilter tangle and @xmath is an end of
@xmath , and write @xmath and @xmath . Pick @xmath and note that @xmath
holds as before. Furthermore, @xmath implies @xmath . Hence @xmath
follows by a previous case. Together with @xmath this yields @xmath .

Finally suppose both @xmath and @xmath are ends of @xmath and write
@xmath and @xmath . By Lemma 3.4.6 there is some vertex @xmath of @xmath
in @xmath . Then @xmath implies @xmath by a previous case, and therefore
@xmath .

“ @xmath ”. Let @xmath be given with @xmath and let @xmath be some tame
auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath . By @xmath , not both @xmath and
@xmath are vertices of @xmath . We check several cases:

First, suppose that @xmath is a vertex of @xmath and @xmath is an
ultrafilter tangle, and write @xmath and @xmath . Furthermore, write
@xmath and recall that @xmath is a vertex in @xmath . In particular, we
have @xmath , which implies @xmath by @xmath . Furthermore, @xmath holds
by Lemma 3.2.1 . Together with @xmath , this yields @xmath .

Next, suppose that @xmath is a vertex of @xmath and @xmath is an end of
@xmath , and write @xmath and @xmath . Assume for a contradiction that
@xmath holds, witnessed by some disjoint open neighbourhoods @xmath of
@xmath and @xmath of @xmath in @xmath , respectively, which are both
@xmath -closed. By Lemma 6.2.5 there is some auxiliary edge @xmath whose
interior meets @xmath and which @xmath traverses. In particular, since
@xmath is @xmath -standard, we know that the whole edge @xmath is
included in @xmath . Let @xmath be an endvertex of @xmath which is also
a vertex of @xmath . Then @xmath holds, but also @xmath witnessed by a
tame auxiliary arc @xmath . This contradicts @xmath , so @xmath must
hold as desired.

Now suppose that @xmath is an ultrafilter tangle of @xmath and @xmath is
an end of @xmath , and write @xmath and @xmath . Pick @xmath and note
@xmath as well as @xmath due to @xmath . Hence @xmath holds by the
previous case. Together with @xmath this yields @xmath .

Finally, suppose that both @xmath and @xmath are ends of @xmath , and
write @xmath and @xmath . Pick some @xmath witnessing @xmath . Then
@xmath meets @xmath in some vertex @xmath of @xmath due to Observation
6.2.3 . Then @xmath implies @xmath by an earlier case, and hence @xmath
follows. ∎

#### 8.4 A second sufficient combinatorial condition

###### Lemma 8.4.1.

If @xmath is a connected graph such that for every @xmath the graph
@xmath has a normal spanning tree @xmath whose subtree @xmath contains
no subdivision of the (infinite) binary tree, then all auxiliary arcs
(in @xmath ) are tame.

###### Proof.

Let @xmath be any auxiliary arc, and assume for a contradiction that it
is wild, witnessed by some infinite set @xmath of vertices of @xmath on
which it induces the ordering of the rationals. By Lemma 6.2.4 we know
that there is some unique @xmath with @xmath . For every @xmath write
@xmath and put @xmath , taking as root for @xmath the root of @xmath .
By [ 13 , Proposition 8.6.1] the rooted tree @xmath is recursively
prunable, so we may assume that every vertex of @xmath receives an
ordinal label by some fixed recursive pruning of @xmath . For every
@xmath let @xmath be the minimal ordinal label of the vertices of @xmath
.

###### Claim 1.

If @xmath receives label @xmath , then @xmath holds.

###### Proof.

Every vertex @xmath of @xmath receives label @xmath by minimality of
@xmath , so @xmath holds. Since @xmath would contradict the fact that
@xmath is a chain in @xmath , equality must hold as claimed. ∎

Now choose some homeomorphism @xmath and write @xmath . Next, pick two
points @xmath in @xmath and let @xmath denote the set of all
accumulation points of @xmath in the open interval @xmath . Since @xmath
is discrete in @xmath we know that @xmath avoids @xmath and @xmath maps
@xmath into the end space of @xmath .

###### Claim 2.

Every point of @xmath is an accumulation point of @xmath .

###### Proof.

Given any @xmath pick a sequence @xmath in @xmath with @xmath , and
without loss of generality suppose that @xmath holds for all @xmath .
Given an arbitrary @xmath pick @xmath big enough that @xmath and @xmath
hold for all @xmath . Using that @xmath induces the ordering of the
rationals on @xmath (and hence on @xmath ) it is easy to find some
@xmath . By choice of @xmath we have @xmath . ∎

In order to yield a contradiction, we inductively construct a sequence
@xmath (where the @xmath are ends, not ordinals) in @xmath together with
a sequence @xmath of vertices of @xmath such that for all @xmath we have

1.  @xmath is a vertex of @xmath ,

2.  @xmath receives label @xmath ,

3.  @xmath .

This suffices, since then by (iii) we have a strictly decreasing
sequence @xmath of ordinals, which is impossible.

We start the construction by picking an arbitrary @xmath together with
some vertex @xmath of @xmath receiving label @xmath . Now suppose that
we are at step @xmath of the construction, and @xmath and @xmath got
constructed for @xmath . Using Claim 2 we find some @xmath in @xmath
other than @xmath . Let @xmath be the maximal vertex of @xmath with
respect to the natural ordering @xmath on @xmath induced by its root.
Since @xmath is an NST and @xmath holds, we know that @xmath witnesses
@xmath . By (i) we have @xmath , so @xmath holds since otherwise @xmath
contradicts @xmath . By Claim 1 , we find some vertex @xmath of @xmath
with @xmath such that @xmath receives label @xmath . In particular,
@xmath implies @xmath . Also recall that @xmath receives label @xmath by
(ii). Together with @xmath and Claim 1 applied to @xmath and @xmath ,
the only possibility for @xmath is @xmath . Thus (i)–(iii) hold for
@xmath . ∎

###### Proposition 8.4.2.

If @xmath is a connected graph such that for every @xmath the graph
@xmath has an NST @xmath whose subtree @xmath contains no subdivision of
the (infinite) binary tree, then @xmath is the maximal Hausdorff
quotient of @xmath .

###### Proof.

By Lemma 8.4.1 all auxiliary arcs (in @xmath ) are tame, so @xmath and
@xmath coincide by Lemma 8.3.6 . Furthermore, @xmath holds by Theorem
3.4.14 . ∎

Proposition 8.4.2 is not best possible:

###### Lemma 8.4.3.

There exists a connected graph @xmath all whose auxiliary arcs are tame
and which has an NST, but which does not satisfy the premise of Theorem
8.4.2 .

###### Proof.

Let @xmath be obtained from the infinite binary tree with root @xmath by
adding an edge from @xmath to every other vertex. Then @xmath is empty
by the same argument we used on the graph from Fig. 15 , and @xmath only
identifies all ends of @xmath with @xmath (since @xmath is the only
vertex of infinite degree). Hence @xmath implies @xmath by Lemma 8.1.1 .
Now Lemma 6.2.5 together with the fact that the auxiliary edges form a
star in @xmath (with center @xmath and the ends of @xmath as leaves)
yields that every auxiliary arc traverses the closure of either one or
two auxiliary edges, and hence must be tame. ∎

#### 8.5 Outlook

Of course, we would like to know whether @xmath and @xmath coincide for
all @xmath . Furthermore, if @xmath and @xmath are two vertices of
@xmath and every auxiliary arc between them is wild, then the question
arises whether there exists structures of the graph witnessing that. One
difficulty are the auxiliary edges between vertices and ends which allow
the auxiliary arcs to ‘jump’ in an NST.

Let @xmath map each sequence to its naturally corresponding value in
@xmath .

###### Conjecture 8.5.1.

For every graph @xmath and every two distinct vertices @xmath and @xmath
of @xmath the following are equivalent:

1.  @xmath and every auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath is wild.

2.   There exists a countable subset @xmath of @xmath such that the
    following hold:

    1.   Every @xmath satisfies @xmath and @xmath .

    2.   The partial ordering @xmath of @xmath induces the ordering of
        the rationals on @xmath .

    3.   There exists a bijection @xmath satisfying @xmath if and only
        if @xmath . Let @xmath map each vertex of the @xmath to the
        vertex separator of @xmath . For every @xmath let @xmath be the
        level of the @xmath containing @xmath , and let @xmath be the
        set of all vertices of the first @xmath levels of the @xmath
        minus @xmath . Then for every @xmath and every auxiliary arc
        @xmath from @xmath to @xmath , the set @xmath meets @xmath .

3.  @xmath .

### Acknowledgement

I am grateful to my family for all the years of support, and I am
grateful to Prof. Dr. Reinhard Diestel for his inspiring lecture courses
which led me here. During the development of this work I received
invaluable assistance from Dr. Max Pitz: He motivated me to investigate
two questions of Prof. Dr. Reinhard Diestel which resulted in Chapter 5
, and he pointed out to me an abstract minimality proof. When I thought
about auxiliary edges, unsure about their usefulness, he showed me
parallels to certain Stone-Čech compactifications. This motivated me to
fight my way through the proof of Theorem 6.3.1 . And while I was still
thinking about auxiliary arcs and the maximal Hausdorff quotient, he
already asked about circles and topological spanning trees in the
auxiliary space.
Thank you so much!
