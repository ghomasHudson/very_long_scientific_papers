effective cosmological equations it leads to. Using exactly solvable toy
models of inhomogeneities, which were explicitly averaged using this
scheme, we saw how an accelerating effective scale factor can arise even
in situations where there is no exotic matter component.

However, the fact that Buchert’s scheme deals with only two of the ten
Einstein equations, makes it difficult to relate the effective scale
factor @xmath with observations. In particular, it is not clear whether
or not @xmath should replace the usual scale factor in the FLRW metric.
We see this difficulty of interpretation as arising from the inherent
non-covariant structure of Buchert’s averaging scheme. To get around
this problem we will study a different averaging scheme in the next
chapter, namely Zalaletdinov’s fully covariant Macroscopic Gravity. This
scheme will allow us to deal with objects which are structurally similar
to Buchert’s scale factor and backreaction, while being easier to
interpret in a physically clear manner.
