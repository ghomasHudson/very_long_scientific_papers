For cofinite Kleinian groups, with finite-dimensional unitary
representations, we derive the Selberg trace formula. As an application
we define the corresponding Selberg zeta-function and compute its
divisor, thus generalizing results of Elstrodt, Grunewald and Mennicke
to non-trivial unitary representations. We show that the presence of
cuspidal elliptic elements sometimes adds ramification point to the zeta
function. In fact, if @xmath is the ring of Eisenstein integers, then
the Selberg zeta-function of @xmath contains ramification points.
