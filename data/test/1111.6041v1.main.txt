##### Zusammenfassung

Das Gravitino ist auch ohne strikte @xmath -Parität-Erhaltung ein
vielversprechender Kandidat für supersymmetrische dunkle Materie.
Tatsächlich sind Gravitinos bei leichter @xmath -Parität-Verletzung
genügend langlebig um die dunkle Materie im Universum darzustellen,
während das daraus resultierende kosmologische Szenario mit primordialer
Nukleosynthese und der hohen Reheating-Temperatur, die für thermische
Leptogenese benötigt wird, vereinbar ist. Darüber hinaus ist das
Gravitino in diesem Szenario instabil und könnte daher durch seine
Zerfallsprodukte für eine indirekte Entdeckung zugänglich sein.

In dieser Diplomarbeit berechnen wir die partiellen Zerfallsbreiten des
Gravitinos in Modellen mit bilinearer @xmath -Parität-Brechung. Zudem
bestimmen wir das Neutrinosignal astrophysikalischer Zerfälle von
dunkler Materie, die aus Gravitinos besteht. Schließlich diskutieren wir
die Möglichkeit diese Neutrinosignale in heutigen und zukünftigen
Neutrinoexperimenten zu beobachten und kommen zu dem Schluss, dass es
eine sehr herausfordernde Aufgabe ist. Dessen ungeachtet könnte dieses
charakteristische Signal eine deutliche Unterstützung für das Szenario
zerfallender Gravitinos als dunkler Materie darstellen.

## Preface

The nature of the dark matter (DM) in the universe is still one of the
unsolved mysteries in modern cosmology. Its existence is strong evidence
for physics beyond the Standard Model, but until now the only indication
for dark matter is based on its gravitational interaction.

One of the most favored solutions to the dark matter problem is the
introduction of supersymmetry with conserved @xmath -parity. In this
framework, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable and
therefore a natural DM candidate, if it is also neutral and only weakly
interacting. The most extensively studied case is where the LSPs are
Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and the dominant
contribution to the dark matter in the universe. One of the most
interesting candidates is, in fact, the lightest neutralino, since it
can be tested in accelerator, direct detection and indirect detection
experiments in the near future [ 1 ] .

On the other hand, it is also possible that dark matter only interacts
gravitationally, and supersymmetry offers also candidates of this type.
In local supersymmetry (i.e. supergravity) the gravitino arises as a
natural candidate for dark matter. It is the superpartner of the
graviton and has been the first supersymmetric dark matter candidate
proposed [ 2 ] . The gravitino is also one of the most elusive dark
matter candidates, since, as part of the gravity multiplet, all its
interactions are suppressed either by the Planck scale (for the spin-3/2
component) or by the supersymmetry breaking scale (for the goldstino
component). Nonetheless, a high reheating temperature after the
inflationary phase in the early universe leads via thermal gravitino
production to a relic abundance that can account for the observed dark
matter density in the universe and is compatible with baryogenesis via
thermal leptogenesis.

Typically, the extremely weak interactions of the gravitino cause severe
trouble for the standard cosmological scenario, since they make either
the gravitino—if it is not the LSP—or the next-to-lightest
supersymmetric particle (NLSP) so long-lived that it decays during or
after Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Therefore, the successful
prediction of the light element abundances can be spoiled (see for
instance [ 3 ] ).

However, it was recently proposed that these problems are easily
circumvented if a small breaking of @xmath -parity is introduced [ 4 ] .
In that case, the neutralino is too short-lived to play the role of dark
matter, whereas the gravitino—if it is the LSP—can still have a
sufficiently long lifetime, even exceeding the age of the universe by
many orders of magnitude. Since the NLSP decays into Standard Model
particles via @xmath -parity violating couplings, the cosmology reduces
to the standard, non-supersymmetric case well before the onset of BBN.

In collider experiments, late decays of the NLSP can be a signature of
this gravitino LSP scenario. Another advantage of models with @xmath
-parity violation is the fact that gravitino dark matter is no more
invisible in astrophysical experiments: Even if the strongly suppressed
couplings rule out an observation in direct dark matter detection
experiments, the tremendous number of gravitinos in the Milky Way and
nearby galaxies compensates for the suppressed decay rate, possibly
making gravitino decay products visible in indirect detection
experiments.

In fact, it has been found in [ 5 , 6 , 7 ] that gravitino dark matter
with a lifetime of @xmath @xmath s and a mass of @xmath @xmath GeV can
account simultaneously for the anomalies in the extragalactic gamma-ray
flux, suggested by the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET)
[ 8 ] , and in the positron fraction, suggested by the High Energy
Antimatter Telescope (HEAT) balloon experiment [ 9 ] .

Motivated by this coincidence, we compute in this thesis the neutrino
signal in the same scenario, both as a consistency check and to find out
whether in this scenario an anomalous contribution to the neutrino flux
may be expected in present and future neutrino experiments. While such
signal is certainly much more difficult to disentangle from the
background, it would provide significant support to the scenario of
decaying dark matter, possibly consisting of gravitinos that are
unstable due to bilinear @xmath -parity violation.

The thesis is organized as follows: In the first chapter we will briefly
review Big Bang cosmology and the astrophysical evidence for dark matter
in the universe. In Chapter 2 we will give a short introduction to
supersymmetry and supergravity, and discuss more thoroughly the
gravitino field, its interactions and its consequences for cosmology. In
Chapter 3 we will introduce models with bilinear @xmath -parity
breaking, discuss in detail the decay channels of the LSP gravitino in
this framework and present the resulting neutrino spectrum from
gravitino decay.

In Chapter 4 we will start with the computation of the neutrino flux
from extragalactic sources and from our own galaxy, considering also the
effect of neutrino oscillations on the signal expected at the Earth.
Then we will discuss the different neutrino backgrounds in the relevant
energy range, compare them to our signal and propose strategies to
disentangle the signal from the background. Subsequently, we will
examine the prospects for a detection of the signal from gravitino dark
matter decay in Super-Kamiokande and future neutrino detectors. Finally,
we will present constraints on the gravitino lifetime from the
non-observation of a neutrino signal, and then conclude in the last
chapter.

In Appendix A we introduce units with @xmath and present a list of the
physical and astrophysical constants used in the course of the thesis.
In Appendix B we introduce the used notation and conventions. There, we
also list numerous formulae used in the course of the thesis and derive
some relevant identities. In Appendix C we present the Feynman rules for
gravitino interactions and the detailed computations of the gravitino
decay widths. In Appendix D we briefly present an example of the PYTHIA
program used to simulate the fragmentation of the gravitino decay
products.

The results from this work have been published in [ 10 ] .

## Chapter 1 Dark Matter and the Early Universe

In this chapter we want to review shortly the basic cosmological
concepts that are relevant for the problem of dark matter. More
comprehensive reviews on this topic can be found for instance in [ 1 ,
11 ] .

### 1.1 Big Bang Cosmology

In this section we will first introduce the dynamics of our universe and
then highlight several important stages of its thermal history.

##### Dynamics of the Universe

The geometry of space-time is determined by the energy content of the
universe. This is expressed in Einstein’s equations from general
relativity

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here, @xmath and @xmath are the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar,
respectively, while @xmath is the space-time metric and @xmath the
energy-momentum tensor. To solve this set of coupled equations we have
to assume symmetries of the universe. Measurements of the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) show that the universe is highly isotropic .
In addition, galaxy surveys indicate that the universe is also
homogeneous on large scales ( @xmath ).

The most general space-time metric compatible with isotropy and
homogeneity is the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker metric. The line element
reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the scale factor, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are the
comoving spatial coordinates and the constant @xmath characterizes the
spatial curvature of the universe: @xmath corresponds to an open, @xmath
to a flat and @xmath to a closed universe. Substituting @xmath , the
line element can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath for @xmath , @xmath for @xmath and @xmath for @xmath .

A simplifying assumption—compatible with the above discussed symmetries
of the universe—is that the matter and energy content of the universe
can be described by a perfect fluid. The energy-momentum tensor for a
perfect fluid in its rest frame reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Solving Einstein’s equations with the above assumptions results in the
Friedmann equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the acceleration equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

These equations determine the dynamics of the universe. Here we
introduced the Hubble parameter @xmath that characterizes the expansion
rate of the universe. From the Friedmann equation and the acceleration
equation we can derive the continuity equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is equivalent to the covariant conservation of the energy-momentum
tensor.

There are several kinds of energy content in the universe, characterized
by the equation of state

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

Radiation and relativistic particles have @xmath whereas pressureless
matter or dust (i.e. non-relativistic particles) has @xmath . A
cosmological constant @xmath can be described by an energy component
with negative pressure @xmath .

The energy of photons and other relativistic particles decreases during
their propagation through an expanding universe. This is expressed in
terms of the redshift parameter @xmath that is defined to be

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath are the wavelength and scale factor at emission,
and @xmath and @xmath are the observed wavelength and the present-day
scale factor, respectively.

From the continuity equation we can derive the dependence of the energy
density on the redshift parameter

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The energy density of non-relativistic matter decreases with @xmath due
to the dilution of the number density with the expansion of the
universe. By contrast, the energy density of relativistic matter
decreases with an additional factor of @xmath because of the energy
redshift in an expanding universe. The cosmological constant is
equivalent to an intrinsic energy of the vacuum and is independent of
the dynamics of the universe.

We can rewrite the Friedmann and acceleration equations using the
density parameter

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

that gives the energy density with respect to the critical density
@xmath , that corresponds to a spatially flat universe. The present-day
critical density is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the Hubble constant @xmath is the present-day Hubble parameter and
is usually parameterized as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath . With the above definitions the Friedmann equation and the
acceleration equation can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus, the present-day Friedmann equation gives a cosmic sum rule

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

Cosmological observations suggest that the universe is spatially flat.
Additionally, the present-day radiation density is negligible, giving
the relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

##### Inflation

Standard cosmology requires very specific initial conditions in order to
explain the observed cosmological parameters. The main two problems are
the flatness problem and the homogeneity problem .

Differentiating equation ( 1.14 ) with respect to the time, we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since the Hubble parameter is always positive in an expanding universe,
we see that @xmath departs from 1 in a matter or radiation dominated
universe, if it is not exactly 1 in the beginning. Thus, in order to
obtain the observed value @xmath today, the initial value must be
extremely fine-tuned. This dilemma is known as the flatness problem.

Cosmic microwave background observations indicate that the universe was
highly isotropic before structure formation. However, the observed CMB
sky is many orders of magnitude larger than the causal horizon at the
time of photon decoupling. Thus, the homogeneity of the temperature
could not be achieved by physical interactions. Instead, it could only
be achieved by extremely fine-tuned initial conditions. This dilemma is
known as the homogeneity problem.

Both problems can be solved by the introduction of an inflationary phase
(where @xmath ) that lasts for about 60 @xmath -folds. This means that
the scale factor grows by a factor of @xmath in this phase. During
inflation, @xmath becomes an attractor as we can see from equation (
1.18 ). Therefore, the universe can arrive at @xmath regardless of the
initial conditions and stay close to that value until today. The
isotropy of the CMB sky can also be explained: The entire observed
universe had initially been a small causally connected region and had
expanded tremendously during inflation.

Such an inflationary phase can be realized by a scalar inflaton field
that enters a so-called slow-roll phase. Apart from solving the above
issues, inflation theories predict large-scale density perturbations
that arise from quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field. These are
observed in the form of temperature anisotropies in the CMB and finally
lead to the formation of structures like galaxies and stars in the
universe.

After the inflationary phase, the density of all particles that
initially were in the universe is diluted. However, the decay of the
inflaton field at the end of the inflationary phase transfers its energy
density into a hot thermal plasma of elementary particles. This process
is known as the reheating of the universe, and the equilibrium
temperature of the thermal plasma is therefore called the reheating
temperature . After this phase the universe is described by standard
thermal cosmology. Energies in the early universe are usually given
according to the characteristic temperature of the thermal plasma. Due
to the adiabatic expansion of the universe the plasma temperature
decreases as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

according to the redshift of relativistic particles. Here, @xmath is the
present-day CMB radiation temperature.

##### Baryogenesis via Thermal Leptogenesis

A crucial question in cosmology and particle physics is why there is
more matter than antimatter in the universe. This problem shows up in
the baryon-to-photon ratio @xmath that is different from zero. In order
to generate a baryon asymmetry it is necessary to satisfy the Sakharov
conditions [ 12 ] :

-   Baryon number ( @xmath ) violation,

-   @xmath -symmetry and @xmath -symmetry violation,

-   Departure from thermal equilibrium.

One of the models proposed to solve the problem of baryon asymmetry is
baryogenesis via thermal leptogenesis [ 13 ] . In this model baryon
asymmetry is generated from a lepton asymmetry. A nonvanishing lepton
number @xmath can be converted into a nonvanishing baryon number through
non-perturbative sphaleron processes. These processes violate the linear
combination @xmath but conserve @xmath . If the sphaleron processes are
in thermal equilibrium in the reheating phase of the universe, they lead
to the relation [ 14 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the number of Higgs doublets and a theory with three
fermion generations is assumed. In the minimal supersymmetric Standard
Model with two Higgs doublets (see Section 2.1 ) one has @xmath .

In thermal leptogenesis the needed lepton number @xmath can be created
in @xmath violating out-of-equilibrium decays of heavy right-handed
Majorana neutrinos. This mechanism is closely related to the problem of
neutrino masses, since heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos can also
explain small nonvanishing masses for the light neutrinos via the seesaw
mechanism. The actual observation of nonvanishing neutrino masses in the
last years strongly supports the existence of heavy right-handed
neutrinos and therefore also the mechanism of thermal leptogenesis.

To achieve the observed baryon asymmetry, the model of baryogenesis via
thermal leptogenesis needs a high reheating temperature in the early
universe of @xmath [ 15 , 16 ] .

##### Primordial Nucleosynthesis

Big Bang nucleosynthesis takes place at @xmath –0.1 @xmath MeV and is
thus based on well understood Standard Model physics. Moreover, BBN
offers the deepest reliable probe of the early universe. The predictions
of the abundances of the light elements D, @xmath He, @xmath He and
@xmath Li are very sensitive to the physical conditions at that
temperature. Thermal equilibrium of neutrons and protons is achieved
through weak interactions like

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

and leads to a neutron-to-proton ratio of

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we neglected the chemical potential. Especially the number of
relativistic particle species (e.g. the number of light neutrino
species) and the baryon-to-photon ratio @xmath determine the freeze-out
time of weak interactions and thereby fix the initial neutron-to-proton
ratio to be @xmath . This ratio slightly decreases to about @xmath due
to neutron decay until the neutrons are stabilized in bound states.
Regardless of the detailed interaction processes, virtually all neutrons
combine with protons to form @xmath . The relative abundance by weight
of @xmath can then easily be estimated:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

The complete calculation of the light element abundances involves all
the details of nuclear interactions and is able to predict the
abundances at the @xmath level.

The Standard Model particle content and a baryon-to-photon ratio @xmath
, as determined from the CMB measurements [ 17 ] , yield abundances of
the light elements that are in good agreement with data from
astrophysical observations (see Figure 1.1 ).

The agreement of the predictions and measurements of the light element
abundances from BBN constrains deviations imposed by physics beyond the
Standard Model.

##### Cosmic Microwave Background

The cosmic microwave background is a relic from the time when the
photons decoupled from the thermal plasma of electrons and light
elements at @xmath (i.e. @xmath ). After the temperature of the photons
dropped below the energy to ionize hydrogen, the universe became
transparent for them. The Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite
mission found that the CMB is highly isotropic and corresponds to an
almost perfect black body radiation spectrum with a temperature of
@xmath (i.e. @xmath ). Furthermore, COBE observed temperature
anisotropies of the CMB at the @xmath level.

The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) satellite mission
investigated the CMB temperature anisotropies in detail. Expansion of
the temperature anisotropy map into spherical harmonics

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

gives the CMB power spectrum @xmath in terms of the multipole moment
@xmath with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using a cosmological model with a limited number of parameters, it is
possible to obtain best-fit values for the cosmological parameters from
the observed CMB power spectrum. Generally, one uses a @xmath CDM model
that assumes a cosmological constant @xmath and Cold Dark Matter (CDM,
i.e. particles that were already non-relativistic before structure
formation) as the dominant dark matter component. Some of these
parameters are given in Appendix A (see also Figure 1.1 ). In
particular, from the position of the first acoustic peak one finds that
the universe is approximately flat ( @xmath ).

### 1.2 Dark Matter

In the following we will discuss the astrophysical evidence for dark
matter in the universe, briefly touch upon the proposed particle physics
candidates for dark matter and introduce two astrophysical particle dark
matter detection techniques: Direct and indirect detection of dark
matter.

#### 1.2.1 Evidence for Dark Matter

Astrophysical observations suggest the existence of dark matter: There
is evidence from observations on galactic scales up to cosmological
scales through the gravitational force. On the other hand, there is no
experimental proof of DM at microscopic scales yet. In this section we
summarize the astrophysical DM evidence following the review in [ 1 ] .

###### Galactic Scale

A very convicing evidence for dark matter on galactic scales comes from
the observation of rotation curves of galaxies , i.e. the circular
velocity distribution of stars and gas as a function of the distance to
the galactic center.

From Newtonian dynamics we expect the circular velocity to be given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath . In the outer regions of a galaxy (where there is no
luminous matter anymore) one would expect the velocity to fall off as
@xmath . However, observations of galactic rotation curves show that the
velocity remains constant even far beyond the luminous disk (see Figure
1.2 ).

This can be explained by the existence of a spherical halo of dark
matter with a density profile @xmath in the outer regions. Different
halo profiles can be parameterized in the following way:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

Profiles obtained from N-body simulations include the profiles of
Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW) [ 19 ] , Moore et al. [ 20 ] and Kravtsov
et al. [ 21 ] . Additionally, we list two profiles including adiabatic
compression (i.e. including the effect of the baryonic gas in the halo):
The NFW compressed and the Moore compressed profile. For comparison we
also list the simple isothermal profile. The parameters of these
profiles are presented in Table 1.1 and taken from [ 1 , 22 ] . The
density has been normalized using a local dark matter density of @xmath
for the Milky Way [ 1 ] . While the slope in the outer regions is
strongly constrained by observations, the slope of the halo density
profile in the inner parts of galaxies is not very well known: All halo
profiles from N-body simulations have a singular behavior at the
galactic center, whereas the isothermal profile is finite (cf. Figure
1.2 ).

It has been proposed that part of the galactic DM halos could be
composed of non-luminous Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). These
could be for instance stellar-mass black holes, feint neutron stars,
white dwarfs or stars, or Jupiter-sized planets. There have been
searches for these objects through the microlensing effect, where
several collaborations monitored the luminosity of millions of stars in
the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds for several years. However, these
experiments found that MACHOs can only contribute a subdominant part of
the galactic DM. Thus, we need non-baryonic dark matter to explain the
galactic dynamics.

###### Scale of Galaxy Clusters

Evidence for non-baryonic dark matter comes also from the scale of
galaxy clusters. In order to indicate DM in clusters, one has to show
that the cluster mass inferred from the luminous components is smaller
than the mass obtained independently using the gravitational force.
Several methods provide this possibility.

Application of the virial theorem to the observed velocity dispersion of
galaxies in clusters allows an estimation of the cluster mass.
Observation of the X-ray spectrum of the hot gas inside clusters gives
the temperature of the gas, which is correlated to the cluster mass
under the assumption of the gas being in hydrostatic equilibrium.
Another method is gravitational lensing : Light from distant sources is
distorted due to the mass of galaxy clusters in the line of sight.
Analysis of a combination of many background sources allows to determine
the shape of the potential well of the cluster.

Comparison of the cluster mass estimated from luminous matter and gas to
the mass determined using the above listed methods gives a clear
evidence for DM in galaxy clusters.

###### Cosmological Scale

In contrast to the previously discussed observations, the measurement of
the cosmic microwave background can be used to determine the total
amount of dark matter in the universe. The values found for the matter
density and the baryon density of the universe in analyses of the CMB
power spectrum strongly hint on the existence of a non-baryonic dark
matter.

The combination of all astrophysical observations gives striking
evidence for a cold non-baryonic dark matter component of the universe.
The value of @xmath from cluster observations, CMB measurements and
supernova data (concordance model, see Figure 1.1 ) together with the
baryon density @xmath from BBN predictions and CMB measurements leads to
an energy density of non-baryonic dark matter of @xmath (cf. Appendix A
).

#### 1.2.2 Particle Dark Matter Candidates

We have seen that the dark matter in the universe must be non-baryonic.
The observations also imply that the dark matter is electromagnetically
neutral and has interactions comparable to the strength of weak
interactions or even smaller.

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics offers only one candidate
for particle dark matter: neutrinos . They are neutral and weakly
interacting, and due to their small mass they would contribute to hot
dark matter (i.e. they are still relativistic at the time of structure
formation). Experimentally, however, simulations of structure formation
favor cold dark matter in order to be in agreement with the observed
large scale structure. In addition, it was found that the three light
neutrinos cannot amount to a significant energy density: @xmath [ 17 ] .
Thus, SM neutrinos do not play a dominant role for the dark matter
problem. However, there is still the possibility that sterile neutrinos
, that are neutral with respect to the SM gauge groups, account for the
dark matter of the universe.

Apart from that, several theories beyond the Standard Model propose
natural dark matter candidates (see for instance the reviews in [ 1 , 23
] ). The most prominent and most extensively studied is the lightest
neutralino of supersymmetry. With conserved @xmath -parity—if the
neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle—it would be
absolutely stable. Additionally, the neutralino can have naturally a
relic density on the correct order of magnitude. Other supersymmetric
candidates are the superpartner of the neutrino, the sneutrino , and the
superpartner of the axion, the axino . Sneutrino dark matter has already
been ruled out by direct dark matter detection experiments, while the
axino is still a viable dark matter candidate.

In supergravity the gravitino arises as a new dark matter candidate with
extremely weak interactions. Thus, if it is not the LSP, it is very
long-lived and thereby the origin of many problems in standard
cosmology. On the other hand, if the gravitino is the LSP, it is stable
due to @xmath -parity conservation and the NLSP becomes long-lived,
causing similar cosmological problems. However, this work will deal with
the consequences for indirect detection of gravitino dark matter in
models, where @xmath -parity is slightly violated. In these models, all
the cosmological obstacles can be evaded (see Section 2.3 ).

Even though there are a lot more particle dark matter candidates apart
from supersymmetry, we will restrict to this list since we are primarily
interested in the gravitino in this work.

#### 1.2.3 Direct and Indirect Detection of Dark Matter

Besides collider experiments that can determine the mass spectrum of
particles beyond the Standard Model, there are two astrophysical
techniques to detect dark matter particles: Direct and indirect
detection of dark matter (see for instance [ 1 ] ).

##### Direct Detection

Direct detection experiments try to detect particles from the dark
matter halo that cross the Earth. They observe the recoil of target
nuclei induced by elastic scatterings of weakly interacting massive
particles off those nuclei. The expected signal is determined assuming
that the dark matter particles are distributed in the halo according to
an isothermal profile and have a Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution
with a characteristic velocity of @xmath [ 1 ] .

Gravitinos have much weaker interactions than WIMPs and thus no signal
from gravitino dark matter can be observed in direct detection
experiments.

##### Indirect Detection

The method of indirect dark matter detection uses the observation of
cosmic rays produced in dark matter annihilations or decays. The cosmic
ray flux originating from dark matter is proportional to the
annihilation rate of the dark matter particle or—if it is unstable—to
its decay rate. Annihilations require the collision of two dark matter
particles, so the resulting flux depends on the square of the dark
matter density. The flux from decays, on the other hand, is proportional
to the density. Fluxes from annihilations therefore depend strongly on
the dark matter distribution.

A comparison of the fluxes @xmath from annihilating and decaying dark
matter in a galactic halo with NFW density distribution is shown in
Figure 1.3 . While the signals from the galactic center and anticenter
differ by less than two orders of magnitude for the case of decaying
dark matter, they differ by more than four orders of magnitude for
annihilating dark matter. The exact numbers depend on the angular
resolution used to regularize the flux from the galactic center, since
the NFW profile is singular at that position.

Cosmic rays from annihilating dark matter are therefore most likely
observed from very dense regions like the galactic center. Other
astrophysical objects like the Sun or the Earth could also amplify the
dark matter density, since weakly interacting dark matter particles are
captured in the center of these objects via energy loss through
scattering off nucleons. However, only neutrinos can escape these dense
objects and could be observed.

In the case of gravitino dark matter there is no accumulation inside
astrophysical objects since the gravitational interaction is too weak.
Thus, we have a gravitino distribution according to the galaxy density
profile. There is no chance to observe gravitino annihilations, since
these are suppressed by higher orders of the Planck scale. So, if the
gravitino is stable, there is no observable signal in indirect detection
experiments. On the other hand, if the gravitino is unstable, it could
be possible to detect signals from its decay. In this thesis we want to
discuss the prospects for the indirect detection of neutrino signals
from the decays of an unstable gravitino.

## Chapter 2 Supersymmetry, Supergravity and the Gravitino

In this chapter we want to give a brief introduction to the relevant
topics of supersymmetry and supergravity and then discuss in more detail
the gravitino. We will mainly follow the reviews on supersymmetry and
the introductions to supergravity given in [ 17 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 ] .
For the discussion of the gravitino field we refer to [ 29 , 30 , 31 ] .

### 2.1 Supersymmetry

Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a generalization of the space-time symmetries of
quantum field theory (QFT) that relates bosons and fermions. It
introduces new fermionic generators @xmath that transform fermions into
bosons and vice versa:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This is a nontrivial extension to the Poincaré symmetry of ordinary QFT
and its structure is highly constrained by the theorem of Haag,
Lopuszanski and Sohnius [ 32 ] .

If SUSY were an exact symmetry of nature, particles and their
superpartners would be degenerate in mass. However, since no
superpartners have been observed yet, SUSY must be a broken symmetry.

Although not yet confirmed experimentally, there are several theoretical
motivations for interest in this additional symmetry. The first is the
hierarchy problem of the Standard Model. This problem stems from the
huge difference of the electroweak scale ( @xmath ) and the (reduced)
Planck scale

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where gravitational interactions become comparable in magnitude to gauge
interactions. The only scalar particle in the Standard Model, the Higgs
boson, receives quadratic radiative corrections to its mass due to
fermion loops. These quadratic divergences can be cancelled by the
contributions of the bosonic superpartners to the radiative corrections.
However, this cancellation works only for softly broken supersymmetry.
If the Higgs mass is to be at the TeV scale, the soft SUSY breaking
parameters can be no larger than a few TeV.

The second motivation is the unification of gauge couplings @xmath ,
@xmath , where @xmath and @xmath are the electroweak coupling constants
and @xmath is the strong coupling constant of the unbroken Standard
Model gauge group

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The renormalization group equations, that determine the evolution of the
gauge couplings, depend on the particle content of the theory. In the
Standard Model the gauge couplings do not unify. By contrast, with the
altered particle content of a supersymmetric theory at the TeV scale,
the gauge couplings unify at the unification scale @xmath (see Figure
2.1 ).

The third motivation is that SUSY provides a promising candidate for
particle dark matter: The lightest supersymmetric particle. With
conserved R -parity the LSP is absolutely stable. In order to constitute
the dark matter of the universe, the LSP must be colorless and
electromagnetically neutral. In that case, it only interacts
gravitationally and—if it is not neutral with respect to weak
interactions—through weak elastic scatterings with Standard Model
particles.

#### The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model

The Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM)
introduces superpartners of the Standard Model particles as well as two
Higgs-doublets and their superpartners. Standard Model particles and
their superpartners are combined into supermultiplets. The gauge
supermultiplets (or vector supermultiplets) consist of a spin-1 vector
boson @xmath , a spin-1/2 Majorana fermion @xmath and a scalar auxiliary
field @xmath , where @xmath labels the gauge group generators. In
particular, we have the electroweak gauge bosons and the corresponding
fermionic gauginos as well as the gluons and the fermionic gluinos (see
Table 2.1 ). The table gives the notation of the particles in
Lagrangians and Feynman rules, and their transformation properties under
the Standard Model gauge groups.

Chiral supermultiplets consist of one complex scalar @xmath , a
two-component chiral fermion @xmath and an auxiliary scalar field @xmath
. Namely, there are three generations of left-handed and right-handed
leptons and quarks, the scalar sleptons and squarks, and the
corresponding antiparticles. Additionally, there are two Higgs doublets,
the fermionic higgsinos and their antiparticles (see Table 2.2 ). Here,
@xmath is the generation index of (s)leptons and (s)quarks and @xmath is
the color index of (s)quarks. The table gives the notation of the
particles in Lagrangians and Feynman rules, and their transformation
properties under the Standard Model gauge groups.

The chiral matter fermions carry spin 1/2 and their bosonic partners are
scalars, while the Higgs bosons are complex scalars and the higgsinos
are spin-1/2 fermions. The enlarged Higgs sector is needed to guarantee
the cancellation of anomalies from the introduction of the higgsino
superpartners. In addition, the two Higgs doublets are needed to
generate masses for ’up’- and ’down’-type quarks as well as charged
leptons after electroweak symmetry breaking.

Supersymmetric Lagrangians are determined by the superpotential @xmath ,
which is a function of the supermultiplets. ¹ ¹ 1 We do not derive the
MSSM Lagrangian here. Thus, we do not introduce the superfield formalism
and two component notation even if we write some expressions in this
form. In the MSSM with conserved @xmath -parity the superpotential is
given by [ 14 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

The hats denote superfields and we sum over generation indices @xmath
and the suppressed gauge indices. @xmath is the supersymmetric Higgs
mass parameter and @xmath denote the quark and charged lepton Yukawa
coupling matrices.

##### R-Parity

As a consequence of observed @xmath conservation one usually introduces
an additional parity called @xmath -parity in the MSSM. This parity is
added by hand in order to forbid processes that lead to proton decay.
Therefore, a new multiplicative quantum number

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

is assigned to all the MSSM particles with spin @xmath . Standard Model
particles have even ( @xmath ) and their supersymmetric partners odd
@xmath -parity ( @xmath ). This imposes that supersymmetric particles
can only be produced pairwise at colliders and that they cannot decay
into Standard Model particles only.

Thus, the lightest supersymmetric particle would be absolutely stable.
Moreover, to be consistent with cosmology, the LSP must be
electromagnetically and color neutral and therefore provides a natural
candidate for particle dark matter.

On the other hand, the most general MSSM superpotential contains also
@xmath -parity violating terms [ 14 ] :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

As in the case of conserved @xmath -parity, summation over the
generation indices @xmath and the suppressed gauge indices is assumed.
The @xmath -parity breaking mass parameters @xmath , and the trilinear
Yukawa couplings @xmath and @xmath violate lepton number, while the
couplings @xmath violate baryon number. There is no symmetry of the
theory that forbids these terms. Experimentally, however, the couplings
of these interactions are very restricted: The proton lifetime of @xmath
[ 17 ] demands, for instance, that either the @xmath violating or the
@xmath violating couplings vanish, or that all the couplings are
extremely suppressed. In addition, the requirement that an existing
baryon asymmetry in the early universe is not erased before the
electroweak phase transition implies that @xmath [ 33 , 34 , 35 ] .

The distinction between Higgs and matter supermultiplets is lost in
@xmath -parity violating models. Therefore, @xmath -parity violation
permits the mixing of sleptons and Higgs bosons, the mixing of neutrinos
and neutralinos, and the mixing of charged leptons and charginos. In
this case, the LSP is not stable anymore. This is a crucial fact for the
decays analyzed in this work.

##### Supersymmetry Breaking

As mentioned before, supersymmetry must be spontaneously broken to
explain the mass differences of Standard Model particles and their
superpartners. In order to solve the hierarchy problem, the SUSY
breaking must be soft, i.e. the SUSY breaking parameters must not
reintroduce quadratic divergences. Moreover, these parameters have to be
at the TeV scale.

There are no realistic models of spontaneously broken supersymmetry
where the SUSY breaking arises from the particle interactions of the
MSSM. Usually one assumes a hidden sector , consisting of particles that
are neutral with respect to the Standard Model gauge groups, and a
visible sector that contains the MSSM particles. SUSY breaking is
assumed to occur in the hidden sector and to be mediated to the MSSM by
some mechanism. Supersymmetry is broken when one of the hidden sector
fields obtains a non-vanishing @xmath -term vacuum expectation value
(VEV), labeled as @xmath .

Since the SUSY generators are fermionic, the breaking of supersymmetry
generates a massless goldstone fermion, the goldstino , analogous to the
massless goldstone boson of electroweak symmetry breaking. This is a
problem of global supersymmetry since no massless fermion has been
observed.

The arising soft SUSY breaking parameters are, for instance, the mass
parameters @xmath , @xmath and @xmath of the electroweak and strong
gauginos, respectively. Further parameters are, among others, the soft
masses of the squarks and sleptons, and the soft masses @xmath and
@xmath of the Higgs doublets. With broken @xmath -parity numerous
additional soft terms arise, for instance the Higgs–slepton mixing
parameters @xmath and @xmath .

##### Electroweak Symmetry Breaking

As we have stated before, in the MSSM there are two complex Higgs
doublets. Electroweak symmetry is broken down to electromagnetism,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

dynamically through radiative corrections to the soft Higgs masses
@xmath and @xmath . The neutral Higgs fields then acquire vacuum
expectation values @xmath and @xmath . The ratio of the Higgs VEVs is
usually denoted as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

The VEVs of the Higgs doublets are related to the Standard Model Higgs
VEV @xmath in the following way:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

According to electroweak symmetry breaking through the Higgs mechanism,
the electroweak gauge bosons absorb the three massless degrees of
freedom of the two complex Higgs doublets: The Goldstone bosons @xmath
and @xmath . These become the longitudinal modes of the massive @xmath
and @xmath vector bosons. The new mass eigenstates are given by

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.7)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where the weak mixing angle @xmath is defined as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

with the @xmath gauge coupling @xmath and the @xmath gauge coupling
@xmath . The photon is massless, while the other electroweak gauge
bosons acquire masses

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.10)
  -- -- -- --------

The Higgs gauge eigenstates can be expressed in terms of the Higgs mass
eigenstates: The neutral gauge eigenstates are decomposed as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the charged gauge eigenstates read

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here and in the following parts we use the abbreviations @xmath and
@xmath for the mixing angles. In the tree-level approximation one has
@xmath and the masses of the Higgs mass eigenstates are given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this case, the mixing angle @xmath is determined by the conditions

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

and is usually chosen to be negative.

In the MSSM decoupling limit, i.e. for a large @xmath parameter, the
particles @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are very heavy and decouple from
low-energy experiments. In this case, using the relations ( 2.14 ), the
mixing angle becomes @xmath and the lightest Higgs boson @xmath obtains
the couplings of the ordinary Standard Model Higgs boson. We will use
this framework later in this analysis.

##### Neutralinos and Charginos

Gauginos and higgsinos mix with each other due to electroweak symmetry
breaking. The neutral gauginos and the neutral higgsinos combine to form
the four mass eigenstates called neutralinos @xmath , while the charged
gauginos and the charged higgsinos mix to form the two mass eigenstates
called charginos @xmath . As mentioned before, the lightest neutralino
@xmath is a thoroughly studied candidate for the cold dark matter in
MSSM models.

In the gauge eigenstate basis @xmath the neutralino mass part of the
Lagrangian is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the neutralino mass matrix is symmetric and reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the relations ( 2.6 ), ( 2.9 ) and ( 2.10 ), the mass matrix can
be rewritten in the following way:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we used the abbreviations @xmath and @xmath for the weak mixing
angle. Using an orthogonal matrix that includes equation ( 2.7 ), we can
change the basis from the gauge eigenstates to the supersymmetric
partners of the massive gauge bosons @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

The neutralino mass term can then be rewritten in the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

Similarly, the basis can be changed to the mass eigenstates, which are
the neutralinos. Symmetric matrices can always be diagonalized by a
unitary matrix @xmath and its transposed matrix. Since we are interested
in positive eigenvalues, we have to add an additional diagonal unitary
phase matrix @xmath (for the problem of negative eigenvalues see for
instance [ 36 ] ). Using these matrices, the transformation into the
neutralino basis reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

so that the neutralino mass matrix is diagonalized in the following way:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

Similarly, for the chargino mass term in the Lagrangian we have in the
gauge eigenstate basis @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the chargino mass matrix @xmath can be written in @xmath block
form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the last expression we used the relations ( 2.6 ) and ( 2.10 ). We
can change the basis to the mass eigenstates using two unitary matrices
@xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

The matrix @xmath can be diagonalized by @xmath and @xmath in the
following way:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the masses are the positive roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath ,
since

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

and are given by

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.29)
  -- -- -- --------

In models where the gaugino masses unify at the gauge coupling
unification scale @xmath , one has the tree-level relation [ 25 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

between the bino and the wino mass parameter at the electroweak scale.
In this work we will use the GUT relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

obtained from the numerically computed renormalization group evolution
of the gaugino masses down to the electroweak scale [ 5 ] .

### 2.2 Supergravity

If supersymmetry is promoted to a local symmetry, i.e. the parameter in
SUSY transformations becomes coordinate-dependent, the theory must
incorporate gravity. This is because in order to achieve invariance
under local SUSY transformations, one has to add a new supermultiplet to
the theory: The gravity supermultiplet, which consists of the spin-2
graviton and the spin-3/2 gravitino (see Table 2.3 ). The resulting
locally supersymmetric theory is called supergravity (SUGRA). The
gravitino, as well as the graviton, is neutral with respect to the SM
gauge groups and has vanishing mass (and therefore only two transverse
helicity states) in the case where supergravity is unbroken.

Since in supergravity there appear couplings with negative mass
dimension, the theory is nonrenormalizable. On the other hand, we assume
that SUGRA is an appropriate low-energy approximation of a more general
theory. In the flat limit, i.e. @xmath , the renormalizability is
restored. In this work, however, we are interested in couplings of the
gravitino to MSSM particles that are suppressed by the Planck mass.
Therefore, we do not work in the flat limit, but take into account only
tree-level interactions.

##### Supergravity Breaking and the Super-Higgs Mechanism

Analogous to the Higgs mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking, in
supergravity there exists a super-Higgs mechanism of supergravity
breaking. The massless Goldstone fermion of supersymmetry breaking, the
goldstino, is absorbed by the gravitino, which thereby acquires its
longitudinal (helicity @xmath ) components and becomes massive.

This is because in spontaneously broken supergravity the Lagrangian
contains a gravitino–goldstino mixing mass term. Invariance of the
gravitino and the goldstino fields under local supersymmetry
transformations demands a redefinition of the fields. The redefined
gravitino is a linear combination of the gravitino and the goldstino,
and therefore gets all four helicity states. In this case the gravitino
mass becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the @xmath -term VEV responsible for the spontaneous
breaking of supergravity.

The value of the gravitino mass depends on the particular SUSY breaking
scheme and can range from the eV scale to scales beyond TeV. For
instance, in gauge-mediated SUSY breaking the gravitino mass is usually
much less than 1 @xmath GeV, while for gravity mediation a mass in the
GeV to TeV region is expected [ 37 ] . Regardless of the specific SUSY
breaking mechanism, we take the gravitino mass as a variable parameter
that is expected to be about @xmath (10–100) @xmath @xmath in order to
account for the dark matter density of the universe (cf. Section 2.3 ).

### 2.3 The Gravitino

In the following we will discuss the classical gravitino field and its
consequences for the standard cosmological scenario.

#### 2.3.1 The Free Massive Gravitino Field

The massive gravitino is described by the following Lagrangian [ 38 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the free gravitino field we discard the interaction part of the
Lagrangian. Application of the Euler-Lagrange equations to this
Lagrangian results in the equations of motion for the free massive
gravitino field:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

From this expression a simpler set of equations of motion can be
derived. To achieve this, we apply either @xmath or the identity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

that is derived in Appendix B , to equation ( 2.34 ). We obtain

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.36)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.37)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Application of @xmath to ( 2.37 ) then results in

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

From equations ( 2.36 ) – ( 2.38 ) the Rarita–Schwinger equations [ 39 ]
for the massive gravitino field can be derived:

  ---------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- --------
                                                 @xmath   @xmath      (2.39)
                                                 @xmath   @xmath      (2.40)
  These equations yield the further constraint                        
                                                 @xmath   @xmath      (2.41)
  ---------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- --------

From ( 2.39 ) – ( 2.41 ) we can also derive the adjoint equations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

In order to find the solutions to the Rarita--Schwinger equations, we go
to momentum space and note that similar to the case of Dirac spinors
there are positive and negative frequency solutions: ² ² 2 As stated in
[ 30 ] , all gravitino processes can be described using only one mode
function, since the gravitino is a Majorana particle. However, in order
to maintain the freedom to choose the direction of the continuous
fermion flow in the Feynman rules (see Appendix C ), we have to discuss
both mode functions.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the mode functions @xmath and @xmath have to obey

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.44)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.45)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.46)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Following [ 40 ] the mode functions can be constructed using the tensor
product of the familiar Dirac spinors @xmath and @xmath of spin-1/2
particles, and the polarization vector @xmath of a massive spin-1
particle. The result is

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.47)
  -- -- -- --------

where @xmath are Clebsch–Gordan coefficients with @xmath . The values of
the coefficients in equation ( 2.47 ) are given in Table 2.4 .

Using this form of the mode functions, and the normalization of the
Dirac spinors ( B.25 ) and the polarization vector ( B.31 ), we can
derive the normalization of the gravitino mode functions. The result is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the calculation of unpolarized decay rates we encounter a summation
over the helicity states of the gravitino field. The gravitino
polarization tensor is defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the sum is performed over the four gravitino polarizations @xmath
. Using the normalization of the mode functions ( 2.48 ) we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus the polarization tensor is a projector. We find that the
polarization tensors for a gravitino with four-momentum @xmath are given
by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

for the positive frequency mode functions and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

for the negative frequency mode functions. In the above expressions we
use

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

For a derivation of the polarization tensors see Appendix B .

Since the gravitino field is a solution of the Rarita–Schwinger
equations of motion, the polarization tensor obeys the following
constraints

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.54)

#### 2.3.2 Gravitino Interactions

In the previous section we discussed the free gravitino field. Now we
want to add interactions between the gravitino and the MSSM fields. The
gravitino interaction part of the Lagrangian reads [ 29 , 38 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

We immediately see that all the gravitino interactions are suppressed by
the Planck scale. The covariant derivative of scalar fields is given in
the MSSM as [ 29 ]

  ---------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- --------
                                                             @xmath   @xmath      (2.56)
  and the field strength tensor for the gauge bosons reads                        
                                                             @xmath   @xmath      (2.57)
  ---------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- --------

@xmath are the generators of the Standard Model gauge groups

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the hypercharge. The Pauli sigma matrices @xmath are
given in ( B.7 ) and @xmath are the eight Gell-Mann matrices which will
not be needed in this work. @xmath are the totally antisymmetric
structure constants of the corresponding gauge group.

The Feynman rules can be extracted from the interaction Lagrangian in
the usual way. Since the gravitino and the gauginos are Majorana fields
for which exist Wick contractions different from those of Dirac
fermions, amplitudes will contain charge conjugation matrices and there
may arise ambiguities concerning the relative sign of interfering
diagrams.

Therefore we use a method that introduces a continuous fermion flow [ 41
] . The direction of this fermion flow in a process can be chosen
arbitrarily, if the corresponding Feynman rules are used. Amplitudes are
then written down in the direction opposite to the continuous fermion
flow. This method avoids the appearance of charge conjugation matrices
and gives the correct relative signs of different diagrams contributing
to a single process.

The complete set of Feynman rules that are relevant for this work is
provided in Appendix C .

#### 2.3.3 Gravitino Cosmology

The addition of the gravitino to the particle spectrum can lead to
several cosmological problems. We want to discuss shortly two of the
main problems and see what restrictions for gravitino theories arise
therefrom.

##### Thermal Gravitino Production

If gravitinos are in thermal equilibrium in the early universe, their
relic density leads to overclosure of the universe. That means they
contribute a density @xmath . This problem can be circumvented in an
inflationary universe, since during inflation any initial abundance of
gravitinos is diluted due to the exponential expansion of the universe.
Gravitinos can then be reproduced by scattering processes in the thermal
plasma after the universe has been reheated (cf. Section 1.1 ). Thermal
gravitino production is enhanced due to the contribution from the less
suppressed interactions of the goldstino component. The gravitino relic
density in that case becomes [ 38 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the reheating temperature of the universe after
inflation and @xmath is the gluino mass. For reasonable values of the
gluino mass and a gravitino mass in the @xmath GeV range, thermally
produced gravitinos can amount to the observed dark matter density, i.e.
@xmath . This constrains the reheating temperature to be @xmath , which
is compatible with the constraint @xmath from thermal leptogenesis (cf.
Section 1.1 ).

##### Impact on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis

Long-lived supersymmetric particles can affect the successful
predictions of BBN if their lifetimes are longer than @xmath @xmath s,
i.e. if they decay during or after primordial nucleosynthesis. The
particles produced in these late decays may induce hadronic and
electromagnetic showers and thereby lead to hadro- and
photo-dissociation of light elements.

The gravitino—in cases where it is not the LSP—decays into lighter
particles with a lifetime [ 42 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

The late decay of the gravitino then implies an upper bound on the
reheating temperature to ensure that the BBN predictions are not
significantly altered [ 43 ] : @xmath . This low value for the reheating
temperature is, however, not compatible with the value favored by
thermal leptogenesis and the paradigm of gravitino dark matter.

On the other hand, if the gravitino is the LSP and stable, the lifetime
of the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle decaying into a
gravitino and Standard Model particles is given by [ 25 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus, the NLSP is present during or after BBN and its late decays may
spoil the predictions of standard BBN. For instance, the hadronic decays
of a neutralino NLSP can dissociate the primordial generated light
elements, whereas a long-lived stau NLSP can form a bound state with
@xmath He and catalyze the production of @xmath Li. This can lead to an
overproduction of @xmath Li by a factor 300–600 [ 44 ] . Other possible
NLSPs like sneutrinos or stops do not substantially affect the standard
BBN predictions [ 45 , 46 ] .

However, there is a more general solution to this problem. The
introduction of a small @xmath -parity violation causes the NLSP to
decay into Standard Model particles before the onset of BBN. Due to the
double suppression of the gravitino couplings to SM particles by the
Planck mass and the small @xmath -parity violation, the gravitino
remains very long-lived and therefore a viable candidate for the cold
dark matter [ 47 ] . This paradigm we will further discuss in the
following chapter.

## Chapter 3 Gravitino Decays via Bilinear R-Parity Breaking

In this chapter we will shortly introduce bilinear @xmath -parity
breaking models of the type discussed thoroughly in [ 4 ] and then
discuss in detail the decay channels of the LSP gravitino via such
@xmath -parity violating couplings.

### 3.1 Bilinear R-Parity Breaking

In models with bilinear @xmath -parity breaking, the MSSM superpotential
contains the additional term

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath are @xmath -parity violating higgsino–lepton mixing masses
and summation over the generation indices @xmath is assumed (cf. Section
2.1 ).

From equation ( 2.3 ) we see that @xmath -parity breaking implies @xmath
breaking. Thus, it can be shown that @xmath is suppressed compared to
the supersymmetric higgsino mass parameter @xmath by @xmath , with
@xmath being the scale of @xmath breaking. The @xmath -parity violating
bilinear coupling @xmath can be rotated away by a redefinition of the
Higgs and lepton superfields:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

This mixing of the Higgs and lepton superfields induces trilinear @xmath
-parity breaking Yukawa couplings

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

that are suppressed by @xmath . The baryon number violating couplings
@xmath are suppressed at higher order in this model. Thus, the model is
compatible with the bound from the proton lifetime. In order to be also
compatible with cosmology, there are additional constraints on the
Yukawa couplings: As already mentioned in Section 2.1 , the viability of
baryogenesis via leptogenesis requires @xmath . Otherwise the generated
baryon asymmetry is washed out before the electroweak phase transition.
On the other hand, the couplings must be large enough to ensure that the
NLSP decays before the onset of BBN. A sufficiently short lifetime can
be achieved with @xmath [ 4 ] .

Apart from the supersymmetric term discussed above, the corresponding
soft bilinear supersymmetry and @xmath -parity breaking terms @xmath and
@xmath arise in the Lagrangian:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Minimization of the scalar potential yields besides the Higgs VEVs a
nonvanishing vacuum expectation value along the sneutrino field
direction:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

This sneutrino VEV explicitly breaks lepton number and generates not
only one neutrino mass, but also nonvanishing mixing between neutralinos
and neutrinos, as well as between charginos and charged leptons [ 14 ] .
In addition, the sneutrino VEV can be used to parameterize the
Higgs–slepton mixing. For later convenience we thus rewrite the relation
for the sneutrino VEV in the following form:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

The above mentioned mixings are responsible for the two-body decays of
the gravitino into gauge/Higgs boson and neutrino, which are the main
source of neutrino flux in our scenario. These decays are also possible
at the one-loop level if only trilinear @xmath -parity breaking terms
are considered [ 48 ] , but we do not consider that case here. Since the
neutralino–neutrino mixing takes place along the zino component, the
branching ratios into the different gauge/Higgs boson channels are fixed
by the neutralino mixing matrix once the gravitino mass is specified.

In this analysis we assume that the sneutrino acquires a VEV only along
the @xmath direction, since we expect the @xmath -parity violating
couplings to be largest for the third generation. The produced neutrinos
then have tau flavor. However, we will see later that this is not a
crucial assumption, since neutrino oscillations change any pure neutrino
flavor into a mixed state. In particular, due to maximal atmospheric
mixing, the flux of tau and muon neutrinos turns out to be identical
(see Chapter 4 ).

### 3.2 Gravitino Decay Channels

In this section we compute the relevant decay channels of the LSP
gravitino in the above introduced model, where the neutralino–neutrino
mixing, as well as the chargino–charged lepton mixing, is generated
through a nonvanishing tau sneutrino VEV @xmath . The primary decay
channels of the gravitino into neutrinos and other Standard Model
particles are

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The first decay mode is practically always allowed, since the tau
neutrino mass is very small. On the other hand, the decay modes into
@xmath and @xmath are only accessible for a gravitino heavier than the
weak gauge bosons, while the channel into @xmath requires a gravitino
mass above the threshold for the production of the lightest Higgs boson.

The total decay width of the gravitino determines the gravitino lifetime
according to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

However, the partial decay widths of the gravitino will contain the
sneutrino VEV from bilinear R-parity breaking whose value is not known.
Thus, we will not be able to fix the absolute lifetime of the gravitino.
Nevertheless, from the relative decay widths of the different decay
channels we are able to determine the branching ratios for these
channels. This is a crucial input for the prediction of spectra of
gravitino decay products.

#### 3.2.1 Calculation of Decay Widths

The gravitino decay widths can be computed from the Feynman rules given
in Appendix C . Here we will only present the detailed calculation for
the decay width of the process @xmath . The calculation of the other
decay widths is given in Appendix C .

#### @xmath

At tree level only one Feynman diagram contributes to the decay of the
LSP gravitino into the photon and the tau neutrino:

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

There is no direct coupling of the photino to the tau neutrino, since it
is electromagnetically neutral. However, the photino mixes with the zino
through the neutralino mass eigenstates and the zino couples to the tau
neutrino via the tau sneutrino VEV. Using the rotation of the neutral
gauge eigenstates into the neutralinos (cf. Section 2.1 )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the relation between the gauge eigenstates and mass eigenstates of
the electroweak gauge bosons ( 2.7 ) together with the generators of the
corresponding gauge groups ( 2.58 ), we can write the amplitude of this
process as

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

To approximate the gaugino propagator we used the fact that @xmath .
Although the tau neutrino is no mass eigenstate we regard it as the
final state here. Its mass is depicted as @xmath and is negligible in
this calculation. In addition, we introduced @xmath . In the next step
we will introduce @xmath and the photino–zino mixing parameter

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since we are looking at the decay of a gravitino and therefore work in
the gravitino rest frame, the gravitino has no defined helicity.
Therefore, we have to average over the initial gravitino spin states.
And since we do not want to measure the polarization of the decay
products we sum over their helicity states. Then we can use the
polarization sums for gravitinos ( 2.51 ), fermions ( B.26 ) and
polarization vectors ( B.32 ), and the squared amplitude becomes

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

In the second step we used the projector property of the chirality
operators ( B.16 ) and in the last step we already replaced squared
four-momenta by the corresponding squared particle masses. The trace
could be further simplified and calculated by hand exploiting the
identities ( B.40 ) and ( B.41 ) for the gamma matrix structure and the
constraints ( 2.54 ) for the polarization tensor. However, here we used
for the calculation of the trace the Mathematica package Feyncalc [ 49 ]
.

According to equation ( C.3 ), the further scalar products of the
four-momenta for this process are given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, the squared amplitude becomes

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

Using equations ( C.7 ) and ( C.8 ) we finally obtain the decay width:

  -- -- -- --------
           (3.11)
  -- -- -- --------

or if we neglect the contributions of the small neutrino mass

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

The conjugate process @xmath , that produces tau antineutrinos, has the
same decay width:

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

The decay widths of the other channels are given by ¹ ¹ 1 These results
do not exactly coincide with those presented in [ 7 ] : For the
interference terms proportional to @xmath we find a negative sign and a
larger coefficient.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the zino–zino, wino–wino and higgsino–zino mixing parameters are
given as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the kinematic functions @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are
given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

The decay widths for the conjugate processes @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
are equal.

The Higgs decay channel and the contribution from the non-abelian
4–vertex to the partial widths of the gravitino decay into the weak
gauge bosons was previously neglected in [ 5 ] . Therefore the
contribution of the photon channel has been overestimated. On the other
hand, it seems that the photon channel has been underestimated in [ 7 ]
due to the different result for the interference term in the @xmath and
@xmath decay channels.

Even if we cannot determine the absolute value for the gravitino
lifetime due to the unknown value of the tau sneutrino VEV, we are still
able to determine the branching ratios of the different decay channels.
They are defined as the ratio of the partial decay width and the total
decay width:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the same set of SUSY parameters as [ 7 ] —i.e. we work in the MSSM
decoupling limit (see Section 2.1 , we use @xmath for the numerical
calculation) and use @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and the GUT
relation ( 2.31 ) between @xmath and @xmath at the electroweak scale—we
can calculate the branching ratios for the gravitino decay channels. For
the weak mixing angle we use the ratio of the electroweak gauge boson
masses

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

The result for the branching ratios is given as a function of the
gravitino mass in Figure 3.1 and for several specific masses in Table
3.1 . ² ² 2 Due to the different result for the interference terms in
equation ( 3.14 ), the photon channel in our result is less suppressed
than in [ 7 ] . As expected, the branching ratio for the decay into
photon and tau neutrino drops drastically for gravitino masses above the
threshold for the production of weak gauge bosons. This is explained by
the @xmath -parity violating mixing of the zino and wino to the tau
neutrino and the tau lepton, respectively. The photino, on the other
hand, has no direct coupling and the decay width is therefore suppressed
with respect to the weak gauge bosons.

For the above results we used a numerical calculation of the mixing
parameters @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . Following [ 5 ] , we
can also give an analytical approximation for some of these mixing
parameters. In the MSSM decoupling limit, the photino, zino and wino are
approximately mass eigenstates since the off-diagonal terms in the
neutralino and chargino mixing matrices are subdominant (see Section 2.1
). In this case, the zino–zino and wino–wino mixing parameters are
simply given by the propagators of those particles, rescaled by the
@xmath and @xmath boson masses, respectively:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

As the photino has no direct coupling to the neutrino, the mixing
parameter is approximated by the product of the photino propagator, the
photino–zino mixing and the zino propagator, rescaled by the @xmath
boson mass:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

These approximations differ by less than 10 @xmath % from the numerical
calculation. The ratios of the mixing parameters are then given
approximately as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we only had to imply the GUT relation ( 2.31 ). For the
higgsino–zino mixing parameters this method cannot be used since @xmath
and @xmath are no mass eigenstates. However, in the MSSM decoupling
limit the higgsino–zino mixing parameters are suppressed due to the
large @xmath parameter. In that case, the diagram with Higgs–slepton
mixing dominates the decay channel. For tau sneutrino masses that are
not degenerate with the lightest Higgs mass we have @xmath , and since
the tau sneutrino has to be heavier than the LSP gravitino, we conclude
that there is no strong dependence of the Higgs channel on @xmath .

We see that the branching ratios given in Figure 3.1 and Table 3.1 are
not only valid for the specific choice of parameters listed above, but
approximately also for a large parameter space. In fact, the branching
ratios for the electroweak gauge bosons dominantly depend only on the
gravitino mass, while the Higgs channel additionally depends on the
Higgs mass by means of the phase space factor.

#### 3.2.2 Fragmentation of the Z@xmath, W and h Bosons

Except for the photons and neutrinos, the decay products of the above
discussed gravitino decay modes are not stable. Since we are interested
in gravitino decays at astrophysical distances, we have to determine the
spectra of stable particles at the end of the fragmentation processes of
the @xmath , @xmath and @xmath bosons and the decay of the @xmath
lepton. The stable final state particles are photons, electrons,
protons, neutrinos and their corresponding antiparticles.

The dominant decay modes and the corresponding branching ratios for the
first fragmentation step are presented in Table 3.2 and in Figure 3.2 .
Since we work in the MSSM decoupling limit, the lightest Higgs boson
@xmath has the same interactions as the Standard Model Higgs boson.

In fact, the complete calculation of fragmentation processes is very
complicated. To obtain the decay products from the @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath channels and their energies, we therefore mimic the decay of a
resting gravitino with the event generator PYTHIA 6.4 [ 51 ] . A
description of the used PYTHIA program is presented in Appendix D .

In order to infer the neutrino spectra from the neutrino energy
distribution obtained from PYTHIA, we need a large number of generated
events for the simulation. Thus we use @xmath events for most neutrino
channels. For the strongly peaked tau neutrino channels of the gravitino
decay into @xmath and @xmath we use twice the number of events.

The numbers of neutrinos of different flavors, generated in the
fragmentation of the different decay products, are summarized in Table
3.3 .

We note that a large number of muon and electron neutrinos is produced
in the fragmentation. At lower energies their ratio is 2:1 as in the
case of atmospheric neutrinos (cf. Chapter 4 ).

#### 3.2.3 Neutrino Spectra from Gravitino Decays

The injection spectrum of neutrinos from gravitino decays is composed of
a series of contributions. The gravitino decay into a photon and a tau
neutrino is a two-body decay with a very long lifetime and virtually
vanishing daughter particle masses. Therefore, the resulting neutrino
spectrum from this channel is just a line at half the gravitino mass:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

By contrast, the decays into the heavy gauge bosons and the Higgs boson
contribute a continuous spectrum. Anyway, the main features of the
fragmentation spectra are also lines. The decays of the gravitino into
@xmath and @xmath result in lines centered at

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

However, these lines are not monoenergetic, but have a shape described
by a normalized Breit–Wigner profile:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the widths are given in terms of the @xmath boson widths according
to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

The leptonic decays @xmath , @xmath and @xmath also produce, in the rest
frame of the decaying particle, monoenergetic neutrinos in all flavors.
However, due to the boost of the bosons in different directions, the
lines smear out almost completely in the Earth’s rest frame, giving just
an additional contribution to the continuous part of the spectrum.

As already mentioned in the previous section, we extracted the
continuous fragmentation spectra for the different neutrino flavors in
the @xmath , @xmath and @xmath channels from the PYTHIA simulation. We
denote these spectra by @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , respectively.
Weighting the constituent channels with the corresponding branching
ratios, the total spectra for the different neutrino flavors are given
by

  -- -- -- --------
           (3.26)
  -- -- -- --------

The resulting energy spectra for the different neutrino flavors are
shown in Figure 3.3 . In this case, and in most parts of this analysis,
we consider a gravitino mass of @xmath @xmath GeV, motivated by the
interpretation of anomalies in other cosmic ray channels as mentioned in
the preface. Furthermore, at lower gravitino masses, the detection of
any signal is much more difficult due to the lower neutrino yield and
higher background fluxes.

For this value of the gravitino mass, both the @xmath and Higgs lines
are visible in the spectrum in addition to the photon line. We see that
the tau neutrino spectrum shows a very characteristic signature of two
or three distinctive peaks (three in the region above the lightest Higgs
threshold, as in this case) in addition to a continuum which is
suppressed at low energies. From Figure 3.1 we see that the dominant
line from the decay into @xmath always has a branching ratio larger than
25 @xmath %. The spectra of the other two flavors are very similar to
each other, consisting only of a continuum contribution practically
following a power law behavior @xmath at energies below the sharp
threshold at half the gravitino mass.

## Chapter 4 Neutrinos as a Probe of Gravitino Dark Matter

In the previous chapter we have seen that the decay of the LSP gravitino
in @xmath -parity breaking models produces stable Standard Model
particles with characteristic energy spectra. The consequences of
astrophysical gravitino dark matter decays have already been studied in
several works: For instance, the gamma-ray signal from gravitino decays
is studied in [ 5 , 24 ] , while the antimatter signals (i.e. fluxes of
positrons and antiprotons) are discussed in [ 6 , 7 , 52 ] .

In this work we consider the neutrino signal at the Earth arising from
gravitino dark matter decays and discuss the implications for the
detection of these neutrino fluxes. In addition, we will use the
neutrino signal to place constraints on the gravitino parameter space.

### 4.1 Neutrino Signals

#### 4.1.1 Neutrino Fluxes

In this section we determine the neutrino flux at the Earth originating
from gravitino decays. In this context the flux is defined as the number
of particles per unit area and unit time. In fact, however, in most
parts we will work with the differential flux per unit solid angle:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

There are two sources for a diffuse neutrino background: Gravitinos
decaying in the dark matter halo of the Milky Way and those decaying in
the halos of other galaxies at cosmological distances.

###### Extragalactic Contribution

Gravitino decays at cosmological distances give rise to a redshifted
spectrum. A neutrino, generated in a gravitino decay at the comoving
distance @xmath with energy @xmath , is observed on Earth with an energy
@xmath due to the redshift of relativistic particles in an expanding
universe. The number of generated neutrinos per unit energy and time in
a comoving volume element located at the comoving coordinates @xmath is
given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here, the number density of gravitinos @xmath is assumed to be constant
on cosmological scales and @xmath is the neutrino energy spectrum from a
single gravitino decay (cf. previous chapter). Since the gravitino
lifetime is much larger than the age of the universe, the decrease of
@xmath through decays can be neglected.

An observer at the origin of the coordinate system receives a
differential flux per unit energy of

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

In order to perform the integration over the comoving distance, we have
to use the dynamics of the universe presented in Section 1.1 . Neutrinos
propagate very similar to light since they are neutral and highly
relativistic. Thus, we have for the line element according to the
Friedmann–Robertson–Walker metric ( 1.3 )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Using the definition of the redshift ( 1.9 ), we can turn the dependence
on time into a dependence on the redshift:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Hubble parameter is described by the Friedmann equation ( 1.14 ). In
accordance with observations we assume a spatially flat matter- and
cosmological constant-dominated universe with @xmath and @xmath . These
parameters describe very well the cosmology of our universe up to @xmath
, where the radiation content plays no dominant role. In this case, the
Hubble parameter is given as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the differential of the comoving distance becomes

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

Consequently, we obtain for the extragalactic contribution to the
differential neutrino flux per unit energy

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath is the time when the neutrinos decouple from the
thermal plasma and start to propagate freely. ¹ ¹ 1 In fact, the
expression for the redshift integral is valid only from the beginning of
the matter dominated universe onwards. However, since the contributions
from high @xmath are negligible, we can actually perform the integration
up to @xmath . The coefficient is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

To obtain this result we have taken the gravitino density to equal the
cold dark matter density, @xmath , and the other constants as @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath .

For a monochromatic spectrum, the redshift integral can be solved
analytically and results in [ 4 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath denotes the Heaviside step function. This expression
produces a characteristic ’triangular’ contribution to the spectrum that
terminates abruptly at the threshold.

###### Halo Contribution

In addition to the isotropic extragalactic signal there exists an
anisotropic signal from gravitino decays in the Milky Way halo. Thanks
to the small extension of the Milky Way compared to cosmological scales,
we can work with distances in a flat space-time. Since we are interested
in the signal observed from Earth, it is convenient to use galactic
coordinates, that have their origin in the Sun. In these coordinates
spatial positions are specified by the distance @xmath to the Sun, the
galactic latitude @xmath and the galactic longitude @xmath . Analogous
to the extragalactic case, the number of neutrinos from gravitino decay
per unit energy and time in a volume element located at the coordinates
@xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

However, in this case the gravitino number density depends on the
position in the galactic halo:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we assume that the Milky Way dark matter halo consists only of
gravitinos. The halo density distribution depends on the halo model but
is spherically symmetric with respect to the galactic center in any
case. A list of established halo models is given in Section 1.2 .

The distance @xmath in the density profiles is given with respect to the
galactic center, so we need to express it in terms of galactic
coordinates. We find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the radius of the solar orbit around the galactic center
[ 24 ] . Due to the far distance to the galactic center the observed
signal is anisotropic. It is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the halo flux parameter is given by the line-of-sight integral

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this expression @xmath is the extension of the dark matter halo in
the corresponding direction. ² ² 2 For the density profiles given in
Section 1.2 the halo radius can safely taken to be infinite since the
profiles are falling off at least proportional to @xmath for large
radii. Since the anisotropy is not very strong if the galactic center is
excluded, we will use in the following analysis only an averaged signal.
The averaged full-sky halo flux parameter is computed via ³ ³ 3 Due to
the symmetry of the halo profile we actually only integrate over one
hemisphere in the galactic latitude.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the averaged halo flux parameter excluding the galactic disk
(galactic latitude @xmath excluded) is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is also interesting to see how much the signal is increased in the
direction of the galactic center. In order to perform an integration
over a cone around the galactic center, it is convenient to change to
new angular coordinates @xmath and @xmath by the transformations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

The angle @xmath describes the declination of the line of sight to the
direction towards the galactic center and the angle @xmath gives the
position in the rotationally symmetric direction around the connecting
line between the Sun and the galactic center. The averaged halo flux
parameter from a cone towards the galactic center with a half-cone
opening angle of @xmath can then be computed via

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

The numerical halo flux parameters obtained from different halo profiles
are presented in Table 4.1 . As expected from the different slopes in
the inner parts of the Milky Way (see Figure 1.2 ), the results differ
most for the cone directed towards the galactic center. By contrast, the
results for the averaged halo flux parameters excluding the galactic
disk agree within a few percent.

Thus, in the following sections we will only present the results
obtained using the Navarro–Frenk–White profile that is given by (cf.
Section 1.2 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath and a normalization @xmath . The halo flux parameter for the
averaged signal excluding the galactic disk is given, in this case, by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

This value will be used in most parts of the further analysis.

#### 4.1.2 Neutrino Propagation and Neutrino Oscillations

After being produced in gravitino decays, the neutrinos propagate over
astrophysical distances until they can be observed on Earth. While
propagating the neutrinos undergo flavor oscillations. Following the
review in [ 53 ] we will thus shortly summarize the relevant
consequences of neutrino oscillations.

The neutrino gauge eigenstates @xmath , @xmath and @xmath do not
coincide with the mass eigenstates @xmath . Since the neutrino masses
are negligible but different from each other, there arise oscillations
between the different neutrino flavors. The quantum mechanical treatment
of neutrino oscillations leads to formulae for the probability that a
neutrino with specific flavor is converted into a neutrino with another
flavor. There are several general constraints for these probabilities:
@xmath -invariance implies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

If we assume @xmath -invariance (and thus also @xmath -invariance), we
have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

The conversion probabilities for the different flavors are then given by
[ 53 ]

  -------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- --------
                                         @xmath   @xmath      
                                         @xmath   @xmath      (4.24)
                                         @xmath   @xmath      
  while the survival probabilities are                        
                                         @xmath   @xmath      
                                         @xmath   @xmath      (4.25)
                                         @xmath   @xmath      
  -------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- --------

In the above expressions we used the abbreviations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using convenient units, we have for the last expression

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

From the roots of this function we can infer the oscillation length for
two-flavor oscillations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

The experimental best-fit values for the neutrino mixing angles @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath , and the neutrino mass differences @xmath are given
in Table 4.2 .

From the value of @xmath we see that there is maximal mixing between
muon and tau neutrinos.

The cosmological dark matter density is spatially constant and the dark
matter density in the galactic halo varies only on scales that are large
compared to the oscillation lengths at energies in the GeV range. This
leads to an averaging of the neutrino oscillations from the viewpoint of
the observer. The huge path length combined with the finite energy
resolution of detectors adds to this effect. Therefore, we are in the
so-called long baseline limit, where @xmath .

Neglecting the small mixing angle @xmath , the resulting oscillation
probabilities are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

All other oscillation probabilities are determined by the relations (
4.22 ) and ( 4.23 ). We note that even when the primary neutrino flux is
originally mainly composed of tau neutrinos, the flavor oscillations
during the propagation produce comparable fluxes in all neutrino
flavors. In particular, due to the maximal mixing between muon and tau
flavor, the signals for the muon and tau neutrinos are identical after
propagation. Thus, the initial assumption that the @xmath -parity
breaking coupling is generated through a sneutrino VEV in the tau
generation is not crucial.

The fluxes for the different neutrino flavors and their extragalactic
and halo contributions are shown in Figure 4.1 . As mentioned before, we
use the averaged halo flux excluding the galactic disk. Additionally, we
employ an energy resolution of @xmath . Therefore, we convolute the
neutrino flux with a Gaussian distribution

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

in the following way:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is chosen according
to the energy resolution: @xmath .

Note that even with this optimistic assumption for the energy resolution
the lines from the decay into @xmath and @xmath become practically
indistinguishable from the continuum whereas the line from the decay
into @xmath can be resolved. Its position could allow a determination of
the gravitino mass, even without determining the endpoint of the
spectrum.

In addition, we note that the extragalactic contribution to the neutrino
fluxes is subdominant. Nevertheless, we will include this contribution
in the numerical results.

### 4.2 Neutrino Background

The detection of a possible neutrino signal from gravitino decay is
hindered by considerable neutrino backgrounds. Namely, in the energy
range of 1–1000 @xmath GeV, there exist large background neutrino fluxes
produced by interactions of cosmic rays with the Earth’s atmosphere or
with the solar corona, as well as neutrino fluxes from distant galactic
sources. Let us briefly discuss these backgrounds separately.

#### 4.2.1 Atmospheric Neutrinos

Collisions of energetic cosmic rays with the Earth’s atmosphere initiate
cascades that generate atmospheric neutrinos. When the primary cosmic
rays hit the nuclei of air in the upper part of the atmosphere, mostly
pions and some kaons are produced. The charged pions decay dominantly
into muons and muon neutrinos via

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

while the decay into electrons and electron neutrinos is suppressed by
@xmath . Before decaying, the muons produced in the pion decays travel
an average distance

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the muon lifetime and @xmath is the relativistic
dilatation factor. If the muons decay via

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

before they hit the Earth’s surface, one obtains a flux ratio of 2:1 for
muon and electron neutrinos and antineutrinos. However, for energies
above a few GeV the muons hit the surface before decaying. Therefore, at
higher energies the ratio @xmath is larger than 2.

In order to determine the fluxes of atmospheric neutrinos one has to
consider several effects. First of all, the spectrum of cosmic rays and
their chemical composition has to be known. For energies above a few GeV
the cosmic ray flux has an energy dependence @xmath and most of its
constituent particles are protons. At low energies ( @xmath ) the cosmic
ray flux is modulated by the solar wind and is therefore dependent on
the eleven-year-cycle of solar activity.

Another important effect on lower energy cosmic rays comes from the
geomagnetic field. Since the cosmic ray particles travel along the field
lines at the poles and perpendicular to the field lines at the equator,
this effect is dependent on the position on Earth. So there exists a
position-dependent geomagnetic cutoff in the magnetic rigidity @xmath ,
where @xmath is the momentum and @xmath the charge of the cosmic rays.
Particles with a magnetic rigidity below the cutoff do not reach the
atmosphere.

These effects and the details of the interactions and decays in the
atmosphere can be incorporated into a Monte Carlo procedure, making it
possible to calculate the atmospheric neutrino fluxes with high
accuracy. The largest uncertainties stem from the initial cosmic ray
spectrum and the hadronic interactions, leading to a @xmath @xmath %
uncertainty in the absolute neutrino fluxes. However, the ratios of the
fluxes of the different neutrino flavors are accurate to better than 5
@xmath %.

At energies above 1 @xmath GeV the fluxes of the atmospheric neutrinos
obey an approximate power law:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

for electron and muon neutrinos, respectively. At lower energies the
slope is shallower due to geomagnetic effects and solar modulation.

In this work we use the fluxes of atmospheric electron and muon
neutrinos computed by Battistoni et al. with the Monte Carlo package
FLUKA (Fluktuierende Kaskade) assuming massless neutrinos [ 55 ] . For
the energy range 0.1–112 @xmath GeV we use the fluxes for the Kamioka
site including the geomagnetic cutoff [ 56 ] . To be conservative, we
use the larger fluxes from the minimum solar activity sample. For the
energy range 25–10000 @xmath GeV only the muon neutrino flux is
available [ 57 ] .

The main tau neutrino background stems from atmospheric muon neutrinos
that oscillate into tau neutrinos on the way to the detector. From
equation ( 4.28 ) we see that the oscillation length on Earth is too
short for a significant conversion of electron neutrinos. Therefore, we
apply two-flavor neutrino oscillations between muon and tau neutrinos to
the initial fluxes. Since the mixing between muon and tau neutrinos is
maximal ( @xmath ), the conversion probability is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this expression @xmath is the neutrino energy and @xmath their
propagation length after the production in the atmosphere. The latter
depends on the zenith angle and is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath being the mean Earth radius and @xmath being the mean
altitude at which the muon neutrinos are produced [ 58 ] . Moreover, the
relevant neutrino parameters for atmospheric oscillations are given in
Table 4.2 .

#### 4.2.2 Further Neutrino Background Sources

In addition to the flux of tau neutrinos originating from the conversion
of muon neutrinos, there exists an intrinsic contribution from the decay
of charmed particles that are produced in the atmosphere in cosmic ray
interactions. This flux is suppressed by a factor of about @xmath
compared to the flux of electron and muon neutrinos from pion and kaon
decay.

This intrinsic contribution has been computed by Pasquali and Reno [ 59
] in a PYTHIA based calculation and can be parameterized as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . The
next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculation also presented in the
paper gives lower fluxes at energies below several TeV and is therefore
less conservative.

Analogous to the production of neutrinos in the Earth’s atmosphere,
neutrinos are produced in the solar corona by cosmic ray collisions.
This neutrino flux has been studied by Ingelman and Thunman in [ 60 ] ,
who found that the flux of electron and muon neutrinos integrated over
the solar disk can be described by the following parameterization:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is valid for @xmath and the numerical values of the parameters are
given in Table 4.3 for both neutrino flavors.

The electron and muon neutrinos and antineutrinos produced in the solar
corona oscillate during their propagation to Earth. Considering the
large distance traveled (compared to the oscillation lengths), the
conversion and survival probabilities can be averaged, and the fluxes on
Earth in the different flavors can be obtained from equation ( 4.29 ).

Last, the fluxes of tau neutrinos that originate from galactic sources
are discussed by Athar, Lee and Lin in [ 61 ] . For the tau neutrino
flux from the galactic plane in the presence of neutrino oscillations
they find the parameterization

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

that is valid in the energy range @xmath .

### 4.3 Reduction of the Neutrino Background

The averaged full-sky signal for the neutrinos from gravitino decay is
shown in Figure 4.2 together with the results for the atmospheric
background from FLUKA. The signal lies several orders of magnitude below
the expected atmospheric background for all flavors. Therefore, we find
that the interpretation of the EGRET and HEAT anomalies in terms of
gravitino decay is compatible with neutrino flux measurements, as it
does not lead to an overproduction of neutrinos.

Going beyond this consistency check, we will examine in the following
section the possibility of detecting this extraordinary flux
contribution in neutrino experiments. Due to the low
signal-to-background ratio, the signal cannot be detected directly. It
will therefore be necessary to find strategies for effectively reducing
the background in order to have any chance of detecting the signal. As
is apparent from Figure 4.2 , the tau neutrino channel appears to be the
most promising of the three flavors, since it has the lowest background.

In general, the neutrino spectrum from gravitino decay has some very
characteristic features that could allow to distinguish it from the
featureless backgrounds, but the question is whether neutrino detectors
are able to reach sufficient sensitivity to resolve these features.

#### 4.3.1 Electron and Muon Neutrinos

For the electron and muon neutrinos, that are more easily detected in
neutrino observatories than tau neutrinos, the signal-to-background
ratio is very small ( @xmath – @xmath ) for gravitino lifetimes that are
not already excluded by bounds from the gamma-ray [ 5 , 24 ] or
antimatter signals [ 6 , 7 ] . As can be seen from Figure 4.2 , even the
peak of the spectrum is three orders of magnitude below the background.
This would make distinguishing an extraordinary signal from the
background appear extremely difficult.

Unfortunately, we could not find a suitable strategy to sufficiently
reduce this background, for example by exploiting directionality. In
general, the atmospheric neutrino baseline ( @xmath ) is too short for a
complete conversion of muon neutrinos into another flavor at energies on
the order of 50–100 @xmath GeV (cf. equation ( 4.28 )). Therefore, a
detection of the signal without having prior knowledge of the position
of the peak in the neutrino spectrum from gravitino decay seems
hopeless. If information on the spectrum is available, for instance from
the detection of a monochromatic gamma-ray line in the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope (FGST, formerly known as the Gamma-ray Large Area Space
Telescope (GLAST) [ 62 ] ), one could envisage strategies to disentangle
the neutrino signal from the background. Anyway, that would probably
require a much better knowledge of the atmospheric neutrino flux at the
relevant energies and a better energy resolution of neutrino detectors
than presently available.

#### 4.3.2 Tau Neutrinos

For the tau neutrinos the signal-to-background ratio is more promising
since it lies above @xmath at the peak energy (cf. Figure 4.2 ).
Moreover, most of the tau neutrino background from atmospheric
oscillations can be effectively reduced by exploiting directionality.
Since we are interested in energies of @xmath (10–100) @xmath GeV, we
are in the region where the oscillation length for two-flavor
oscillations between muon and tau neutrinos is larger than the Earth
diameter. Thus, the conversion probability for down-going muon neutrinos
(i.e. neutrinos from above the horizon) is approximately given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

We have seen earlier that the atmospheric muon neutrino flux has an
energy dependence @xmath in the range above 1 @xmath GeV. Therefore, we
expect for the down-going tau neutrinos a flux with an energy dependence

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

Due to the steeper slope, the previously subdominant tau neutrino
background sources become important at higher energies. Anyway, these
backgrounds can also be effectively reduced by exploiting
directionality. In fact, since the solar corona neutrinos and the
galactic neutrinos come from the direction of the Sun or from the
galactic plane, these directions could simply be excluded from the
search to reduce the background. This is why we excluded the galactic
disk in the calculation of the halo contribution to the neutrino flux.

Thus—regarding only down-going tau neutrinos—the background can be
reduced by several orders of magnitude. In Figure 4.3 we show the fluxes
for down-going tau neutrinos at the Super-Kamiokande site. We see that
in this case the signal can overcome the simulated background from
FLUKA, even without cutting away the Sun or the galactic plane.

### 4.4 Detection Prospects

In this section we discuss the prospects for the detection of the
extraordinary signal in the tau neutrino flavor in present and future
neutrino experiments. For that purpose, we first briefly describe the
detection technique of water Čerenkov detectors following the reviews in
[ 53 , 63 ] .

#### 4.4.1 Water Čerenkov Detectors

Water Čerenkov detectors like Super-Kamiokande or IceCube consist of
pure water or ice and a large number of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs)
that detect in real time the Čerenkov light emitted by relativistic
charged particles.

Charged leptons can be generated by neutrinos, that cross the detector,
via charged current (CC) scatterings off nuclei in the water ( @xmath )
and in the case of electron neutrinos also by elastic scatterings off
electrons. Following these interactions, Čerenkov light is emitted if
the charged particle’s velocity is larger than the speed of light in
water.

This technique works well for electron and muon neutrinos, which
generate an electron and a muon in the CC interaction, respectively.
Muons produce a sharp Čerenkov ring, while electrons produce a diffuse
ring. Thus, the neutrino flavor can be identified using the Čerenkov
light signature. On the other hand, it is not possible to distinguish
particles from antiparticles.

Tau leptons, generated from tau neutrinos, decay very fast via hadronic
channels and therefore do not produce a clear Čerenkov light signature.
The cross section for CC interactions of tau neutrinos and antineutrinos
with nuclei has been calculated with the neutrino interaction simulation
program NEUT in [ 64 ] . The result is presented in Figure 4.4 . Clearly
visible is the threshold for @xmath lepton production in the reaction
@xmath at @xmath .

By the measurement of the Čerenkov light with PMTs, it is possible to
reconstruct the energy and the direction of the charged lepton. However,
this is not sufficient to reconstruct the neutrino energy without
knowing the direction of the incoming neutrino, which differs from the
lepton direction by @xmath [ 65 ] . Therefore, the neutrino events are
usually classified according to the signal topology.

Electron or muon events for which the particle track starts and ends
inside the detector are called fully contained events. In this case, the
lepton energy can be reconstructed. This event type is further divided
into sub-GeV and multi-GeV events, depending on whether the lepton
energy is below or above @xmath @xmath GeV. On average, sub-GeV events
originate from neutrinos of several hundred MeV, and multi-GeV events
arise from neutrinos of few GeV energy.

If the lepton is produced inside the detector but escapes from it, the
event is called partially contained . In this case, only the visible
energy of the lepton can be reconstructed. Since these events originate
from neutrinos with energies comparable to those of fully contained
events, they are usually grouped together.

When a muon is produced in the rock below the detector and its track
ends inside the detector, one speaks of up-going stopping muon events.
The typical energy of parent neutrinos is @xmath @xmath GeV. However,
this event topology does not occur for electrons, as they produce
electromagnetic showers in the surrounding material before reaching the
detector. We note that down-going muons are usually not taken into
account, since they cannot be distinguished from the background of
cosmic ray muons.

If a muon track crosses the whole detector from below, the event is
called up-going through-going muon. These events originate from
neutrinos with energies of 10–1000 @xmath GeV.

The contribution of neutrinos to the different event topologies
described above can be simulated and is presented in Figure 4.5 as a
function of the neutrino energy. From this discussion we see that it is
only possible to reconstruct the neutrino energy on a statistical basis
using the event topology and the constraint that the neutrino energy
must be larger than the visible energy of the charged lepton.

Given this fact, the employed energy resolution of 10 @xmath % for the
neutrino flux in all figures is very optimistic and way beyond
feasibility in present neutrino detectors.

#### 4.4.2 Observability in Super-Kamiokande

Super-Kamiokande is a cylindrical 50 @xmath kton water Čerenkov detector
located in the Kamioka mine in central Japan. The fiducial mass of the
detector is 22.5 @xmath kton (i.e. the effective detector mass that can
be used for analyses).

The Super-Kamiokande collaboration has developed a statistical method to
discriminate tau neutrinos from the background of other flavors [ 66 ] .
Using two different strategies, namely a likelihood analysis and a
neural network, they find an efficiency of 43.1 @xmath % and 39.0 @xmath
%, respectively, to identify tau neutrinos correctly. However, they
still misidentify 3.8 @xmath % and 3.4 @xmath %, respectively, of the
electron and muon background neutrinos as tau neutrinos.

Due to the large number of atmospheric electron and muon neutrino
events, the sample of tau neutrinos is thus dominated by misidentified
neutrinos. The actual tau neutrino events can therefore only be
extracted on a statistical basis, using Monte Carlo methods. In the end,
the data is found to be consistent with the expected atmospheric tau
neutrino flux in the presence of neutrino oscillations: The full-sky
atmospheric tau neutrino signal results in fact in 78 events from CC
interactions in the fiducial volume during the Super-K I period and 43
events during the Super-K II period [ 64 , 66 ] .

However, the above mentioned analysis does not exploit the information
about the spectral shape of the signal, apart from setting a threshold
for @xmath lepton production. So this kind of data analysis could
certainly be improved in order to search for a signal with a peak above
the continuum, as in our case.

Apart from the experimental difficulties, it is worthwhile to examine
the theoretically expected signal in the tau channel. Figure 4.6 shows
the expected number of tau neutrino and antineutrino events per century
of observation at Super-Kamiokande within a zenith angle integrated from
@xmath to 1. If only down-going neutrinos are selected, the signal from
the gravitino decay lies above the atmospheric background, especially
for higher energies. However, the fluxes are extremely low and result
only in a few events per century, making it practically impossible to
discriminate them from the other flavors using statistical methods.

One detector specifically optimized for measuring tau neutrinos above 17
@xmath GeV event by event is OPERA, which is already active in Gran
Sasso and will measure tau neutrino appearance in a muon neutrino beam
produced at CERN. Unfortunately, the detector’s effective mass is more
than a factor 10 smaller than that of Super-K and thus—even neglecting
the issue of directionality—would be able to observe only one event in
more than 1000 years.

We therefore conclude that present detectors are not able to detect the
signal, either because they do not have sufficient efficiency for
identifying tau neutrinos, or because they are too small for the low
intensity of our signal, or both.

#### 4.4.3 Future Detectors

We will discuss briefly in this section the prospects of detection for
the future.

##### Hyper-Kamiokande

The prospects for Hyper-Kamiokande can be easily obtained by considering
that its mass is planned to be a factor of 10 (for the 0.5 @xmath Mton
project) to 20 (for a 1 @xmath Mton case) larger than Super-K. Assuming
that the rest of the detector characteristics are unchanged, we expect
it to have at most @xmath (20--40) events from our signal per century
from the upper hemisphere. ⁴ ⁴ 4 This number could be increased if the
fiducial volume of Hyper-Kamiokande is larger than @xmath of the total
volume, as it is in Super-Kamiokande.

This number of events might be still too small to allow for statistical
analysis. On the other hand, we expect most of the events to appear
within the peak region or near the threshold. Therefore, using an
appropriate energy binning—especially if the signal has been detected
already in the gamma-ray channel—could even allow to collect a
significant number of events above the background in a specific energy
bin on shorter timescales.

Nevertheless, it is clear that a sufficiently good energy resolution is
a key requirement for extracting the events from the line, and it
remains uncertain how and if the statistical tau flavor discrimination
analysis can be applied to a sample of such few events.

##### IceCube and km@xmath Detectors

Detectors of km @xmath dimensions have in principle sufficient size to
collect enough events to detect the signal from gravitino decay within a
reasonable time span. Even considering that IceCube is actually looking
downwards and not at the upper hemisphere, from the horizontal direction
and the CC cross section for tau neutrinos we estimate @xmath events per
year for the completed experiment. Of course, the effective area depends
on the neutrino energy: Taking the effective area, given in [ 67 ] for
up-going events, for our signal from the opposite direction and assuming
most of the signal is above 100 @xmath GeV, we have instead @xmath
events per year.

In general, it would be desirable to decrease the energy threshold of
IceCube below 100 @xmath GeV in order to cover the energy range favored
by the EGRET and HEAT anomalies. The combination of IceCube with the
Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA) already allows to
lower the threshold to 30 @xmath GeV. Additionally, plans are being
considered for adding another, denser subdetector at a deeper location
to improve the sensitivity to dark matter annihilations [ 67 ] . Such a
configuration could probably also be useful for investigating the
present scenario and, more generally, other decaying dark matter
candidates.

As we have stated before, in the case of water Čerenkov detectors, the
discrimination of tau neutrinos from other neutrino flavors is generally
difficult, and for IceCube strategies for tau flavor identification have
been proposed only for neutrinos well above TeV energies [ 68 ] . It
could therefore be more favorable to improve the energy resolution and
exploit the muon neutrino final state instead.

### 4.5 Constraints on the Gravitino Parameters

In this final section we want to present constraints on the gravitino
lifetime as a function of its mass from the non-observation of the
neutrino signal from gravitino dark matter decay. To achieve this, we
compare the neutrino flux from gravitino decay to the atmospheric
background flux.

In particular, we only take the halo contribution of the photon and
@xmath lines discussed in Section 3.2 to approximate the signal,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

and consider either the signal in all neutrino flavors or only the tau
flavor. According to the unitarity of the conversion probabilities for
neutrino oscillations, the signal in all neutrino flavors is given by
the expressions above, whereas for the tau signal we have to apply the
survival probability @xmath .

To allow for the poor energy resolution of neutrino detectors, we adopt
a nominal energy resolution of @xmath in @xmath around the peak position
[ 65 ] . Thus, we convolute the neutrino fluxes with a Gaussian
distribution in the logarithm of the neutrino energy:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the altered coefficients take care of the correct normalization
and the convolution is computed according to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

The actual lower bound on the gravitino lifetime is determined by the
criterion that the flux at the peak position equals the simulated
background either for all flavors or for down-going tau neutrinos only.
The result is presented in Figure 4.7 . For the flux in all neutrino
flavors, it is similar to that presented in [ 65 ] , except that we are
weighting the channels with the gravitino branching ratios and that we
have only one neutrino produced in the lines instead of two.

Note that since the signal from gravitino decay is proportional to
@xmath , requiring the peak flux to be larger than the background by a
particular factor only rescales the exclusion curves by the inverse of
this factor.

We clearly see that again the tau neutrino channel in the down-going
direction allows to constrain the gravitino lifetime a few orders of
magnitude better than the muon or electron neutrino channels. On the
other hand, similar plots for the gamma-ray channel are even more
sensitive and give bounds on the order of @xmath @xmath s for gravitino
masses below the @xmath and @xmath thresholds [ 24 ] .

For masses above @xmath @xmath GeV, the tau neutrino channel even starts
to compete in sensitivity with the photon channel. Admittedly, we must
point out that the presented bounds are only hypothetical since we
neglect the difficulties connected with the measurement of such a low
flux in neutrino detectors and the identification of the neutrino
flavor.

## Chapter 5 Conclusions

The scenario of gravitino dark matter with slightly broken @xmath
-parity is theoretically well motivated as it leads to a consistent
thermal history of the universe including both baryogenesis via thermal
leptogenesis and standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis.

Although the above scenario was originally devised to reconcile the
thermal history of the universe with supersymmetric dark matter, it has
been pointed out in the recent literature that the decay of gravitino
dark matter with a lifetime of @xmath @xmath s and a mass of @xmath into
massive gauge bosons may account for the anomalies observed in the
diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray spectrum as measured by EGRET, as well
as in the positron fraction as measured by HEAT. ¹ ¹ 1 The existence of
an excess in the positron fraction seems to be supported by preliminary
results of the PAMELA (a Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and
Light-nuclei Astrophysics) satellite mission [ 69 ] .

In this thesis we examined the neutrino signal from the decay of
unstable gravitino dark matter in a scenario with bilinear @xmath
-parity breaking. Motivated by the possible explanation of anomalies in
other cosmic ray channels, we recomputed the gravitino decay widths,
taking into account also the Feynman diagrams with the non-abelian
4–vertex for the @xmath and @xmath channels and the decay into the
lightest Higgs boson. Using the resulting branching ratios for the
gravitino decay channels, we determined the neutrino signal on Earth
originating from gravitino dark matter decay.

As a consistency check of the scenario, we employed the same gravitino
parameters as those that were used to account for the anomalies in other
cosmic ray channels and found that the neutrino signal is compatible
with results from present neutrino experiments. In addition, we have
examined the detectability of this extraordinary component of the
neutrino flux to find an independent way to test this scenario.

While the signal in the neutrino spectrum with two or more distinct
peaks, resulting from two-body gravitino decays into gauge/Higgs boson
and neutrino, is very characteristic, it will be challenging to detect
these features in neutrino experiments. On one side, present neutrino
detectors do not achieve a sufficient energy resolution to resolve peaks
in the spectrum, and on the other side, the event rate is expected to be
so small that the background of atmospheric neutrinos overwhelms the
signal in all flavors.

The most promising signal-to-background ratio is found for tau
neutrinos, especially when considering only the flux from above the
horizon, since there the atmospheric tau neutrino flux is substantially
reduced. However, tau neutrinos are difficult to identify in water
Čerenkov detectors and probably only an event-by-event identification
could allow detecting the signal with such extremely limited statistics.
Therefore, we conclude that it is currently not possible to detect this
contribution due to present technological limitations.

The ideal detector for testing the present scenario would be one of
megaton mass with the ability to identify and measure tau neutrinos
event by event. Should such a detector ever become available, it could
be worthwhile to look for this extraordinary component of the neutrino
flux by employing strategies for background reduction such as the ones
discussed here, especially if the anomalous signatures in the positron
fraction and the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray spectrum are confirmed
by PAMELA and FGST, respectively.

In principle, the non-observation of the neutrino signal can be used to
infer bounds on the gravitino signal, but we found that these bounds
presumably cannot compete with the bounds from other decay channels,
like the decay into photons, positrons or antiprotons.

On the other hand, the detection of a signal in neutrinos, that is
compatible with signals in the other indirect detection channels, would
in fact bring significant support to the scenario of decaying dark
matter, possibly consisting of gravitinos that are unstable due to
bilinear @xmath -parity breaking.

## Appendix B Notation, Conventions and Formulae

###### Four-Vectors and Tensors

Lorentz indices are depicted by small Greek letters, e.g. @xmath . The
metric of Minkowski space is chosen to be

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Lorentz indices of four-vectors and higher rank tensors are raised and
lowered using the space-time metric:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

We use in all cases a sum convention for Lorentz indices:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### Antisymmetric Tensor

The totally antisymmetric tensor @xmath is chosen such that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

This implies for the totally antisymmetric tensor with lowered indices,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

that @xmath .
The totally antisymmetric tensor in three dimensions @xmath is chosen
such that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### Pauli Matrices

The Pauli sigma matrices read

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

and satisfy the identity

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### Gamma Matrices

The Dirac gamma matrices form a Clifford algebra

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

In most cases it is convenient to suppress the spinor indices of the
gamma matrices, so we do not write them here. Using the above algebra
and the metric ( B.1 ) it can be easily seen that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

Hermitian conjugation of the gamma matrices yields

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Lorentz indices of gamma matrices are raised and lowered by the
metric, just as in the case of four-vectors. That implies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus, we see that raising and lowering of Lorentz indices is equivalent
to hermitian conjugation. In addition to @xmath a fifth gamma matrix can
be defined

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the algebra ( B.9 ) it can be easily shown that @xmath has the
following properties:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

The matrix @xmath is used to define the chirality projection operators

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

These operators possess the projector properties

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

A very common object in theories of particles with half-integral spin is
the contraction of gamma matrices with the particle momentum. Therefore,
we use the Feynman slash notation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

In order to obtain Lorentz scalars, in the formulation of theories of
particles with half-integral spin there occur products of adjoint
spinors and spinors. The adjoint spinor and adjoint vector-spinor are
defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

respectively.

###### Majorana Spinors

Majorana particles are invariant under charge conjugation. Thus, the
Majorana condition reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here we use the charge-conjugation matrix @xmath that has the properties

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the above expression we use the definition @xmath .

###### Dirac Spinors

The free Dirac equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

has four linearly independent plane wave solutions:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the spinors @xmath and @xmath have to obey the following
constraints:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

The normalization of the Dirac spinors is given by [ 70 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the polarization sums for spin-1/2 fermions are given by [ 70 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the sum is performed over the fermion polarizations @xmath .

###### Polarization Vectors

Free massless spin-1 particles in the Lorentz gauge ( @xmath ) and free
massive spin-1 particles obey the Proca equation [ 27 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation has the solutions

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a polarization vector. The condition @xmath demands that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

reducing the number of independent polarization vectors to three.

For massless spin-1 particles we have the freedom to make the additional
gauge transformation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

The condition for @xmath is required by the Lorentz gauge condition.
This additional gauge freedom reduces the number of independent
polarization vectors for massless spin-1 particles to two.

The polarization vectors are normalized according to [ 40 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

while the polarization sums are given by [ 70 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the sum is performed over the two polarization states of the
massless spin-1 particle @xmath , and by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the sum is performed over the three polarization states of the
massive spin-1 particle @xmath .

###### Identities for Gamma Matrices

In the calculation of squared amplitudes we encounter traces of gamma
matrices. For these the following identities can be derived from the
algebra ( B.9 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

We also encounter contractions of gamma matrices. Using the algebra (
B.9 ), we obtain the following identities:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

Any complex @xmath matrix @xmath can be expanded in terms of a basis of
gamma matrices,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

according to the relation [ 71 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the dual basis. The dual basis can be determined using
the orthogonality relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

and corresponds to the hermitian conjugate of the basis. Thus we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

We want to apply this expansion identity to a combination of gamma
matrices that appears in the coupling of the gravitino to the gauge
supermultiplet:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Using the trace identities for gamma matrices ( B.34 ), we note that
traces of an odd number of gamma matrices vanish. For the two
nonvanishing traces we obtain

  ----- -------- -------- -- --
        @xmath   @xmath      
                 @xmath      
        @xmath   @xmath      
  and                        
        @xmath   @xmath      
  ----- -------- -------- -- --

Thus, we finally obtain the relation

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- --------
                                                                                  @xmath   @xmath      (B.40)
  Using the algebra ( B.9 ), we can additionally derive the following relation:                        
                                                                                  @xmath   @xmath      (B.41)
  From both of these relations we can easily derive the following identity:                            
                                                                                  @xmath   @xmath      (B.42)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -- --------

###### Gravitino Polarization Tensor

Due to the Lorentz structure of the spin sum for the gravitino, it must
be a linear combination of the following ten tensors [ 72 ] :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where we have added factors of @xmath to get the correct dimension of
the spin sum according to equation ( 2.50 ). Therefore we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Analogous to the case of Dirac spinors, we get two polarization sums for
the positive and negative frequency solutions. The coefficients can be
uniquely determined using the constraints from the Rarita–Schwinger
equations for the mode functions ( 2.44 ), ( 2.45 ) and from the
projector property of the polarization tensor ( 2.50 ).

For the construction of the positive frequency spin sum, application of
( 2.44 ) gives

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and application of ( 2.45 ) gives the further relations

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The polarization tensor then becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The projector property ( 2.50 ) finally gives @xmath . Therefore, the
positive frequency polarization tensor of the gravitino reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is equivalent to the form given in equation ( 2.51 ).

Similarly, the negative frequency polarization tensor is determined.
From ( 2.44 ), ( 2.45 ) and ( 2.50 ) we obtain

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath . Thus, the negative frequency polarization tensor of the
gravitino reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is equivalent to the form given in equation ( 2.52 ).

## Appendix C Calculation of Decay Widths

### c.1 Feynman Rules

In this section we provide the necessary Feynman rules for the
calculation of the gravitino decay widths. This set is taken from [ 29 ]
and amended by the addition of the rules for the negative frequency
solution of the gravitino.

Gravitinos are depicted as double solid lines, chiral fermions are drawn
as single solid lines and scalars are drawn as dashed lines. Gauge
bosons are represented by wiggled lines and gauginos by solid lines with
additional wiggled lines.

The continuous fermion flow is independent of the fermion number flow
carried by fermions and sfermions and also of the momentum direction.

### c.3 Gravitino Decay Channels

In this section we compute the dominant decay channels of the LSP
gravitino in the framework of bilinear @xmath -parity breaking. The
relative decay widths of the different decay channels determine the
branching ratios for these channels. Therefore, this is a crucial input
for the prediction of spectra of gravitino decay products.

#### @xmath

At tree level the decay of the gravitino into the @xmath boson and the
tau neutrino gets contributions from two Feynman diagrams:

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

Apart from the diagram with the abelian 3–vertex and subsequent zino–tau
neutrino mixing through the tau sneutrino VEV, we have a diagram with
the non-abelian 4–vertex that reduces to an effective 3–vertex using the
tau sneutrino VEV from bilinear @xmath -parity breaking. Analogous to
the decay of the gravitino into the photon and the tau neutrino, the
amplitude for this process reads

  -- -- --

Similar to the procedure in Section 3.2 , we rewrite some prefactors and
introduce the zino–zino mixing parameter

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

We note that the zino–zino mixing parameter is real-valued. Thus, the
squared amplitude for this process becomes

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

In the last step we already replaced squared four-momenta by the
corresponding squared particle masses. The other scalar products of the
four-momenta in this process are given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Therefore, we obtain for the squared amplitude

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Discarding the terms proportional to the negligible neutrino mass and
taking into account the correct phase space factor, the width for the
decay of the gravitino into the @xmath boson and the tau neutrino
becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the kinematic factors @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are
given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

The conjugate process @xmath , that produces tau antineutrinos, has the
same decay width:

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### @xmath

Two tree-level Feynman diagrams contribute to the decay of the gravitino
into the @xmath boson and the @xmath lepton:

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

Using the rotation of the charged gauge eigenstates into the charginos
(cf. Section 2.1 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the relation between the gauge eigenstates and mass eigenstates of
the electroweak gauge bosons ( 2.8 ) together with the generators of the
corresponding gauge groups ( 2.58 ), we can write for the amplitude of
this process

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

Rewriting some coefficients and introducing the wino–wino mixing
parameter

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

that is real-valued, the squared amplitude for this process becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The traces are completely the same as in the previously discussed decay.
Only the prefactors and the kinematics differ. Adopting the correct
prefactors, neglecting @xmath and exchanging @xmath with @xmath in the
kinematic factors, the width for the decay of the gravitino into the
@xmath boson and the @xmath lepton reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the kinematic factors @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are the
same as those defined in equation ( C.11 ).

The conjugate process @xmath has the same decay width

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### @xmath

The decay of the gravitino into the lightest Higgs boson and the tau
neutrino also gets contributions from two tree-level Feynman diagrams

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

In the MSSM decoupling limit the mixing angle @xmath becomes equal to
@xmath (cf. Section 2.1 ). Therefore we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the decomposition of the gauge eigenstates into the mass eigenstates
for the neutral Higgs bosons ( 2.11 ) becomes

  -- -- -- --------
           (C.18)
  -- -- -- --------

The inversion of this equation gives for the lightest Higgs boson

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

Application of this relation to the Higgs–slepton mixing terms in
equation ( 3.4 ) together with the relation for the sneutrino VEV ( 3.6
) results in the coupling

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

between the tau sneutrino and the lightest Higgs boson, that appears in
the first Feynman diagram. For the second diagram we use the vertices of
the gravitino with the Higgs gauge eigenstates @xmath and the
corresponding higgsino states @xmath . Then we use the rotation of the
Higgs gauge eigenstates @xmath into the mass eigenstates @xmath and
@xmath , which is given above in equation ( C.18 ). Since we assume that
the heavier Higgs bosons are kinematically not accessible, we only
consider the final states with the lightest Higgs boson. Then we use,
analogous to the other gravitino decay modes, the rotation of the
neutral gauge eigenstates into the neutralinos (cf. Section 2.1 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the relation between the gauge eigenstates and mass eigenstates of
the electroweak gauge bosons ( 2.7 ) together with the generators of the
corresponding gauge groups ( 2.58 ) to write for the amplitude of this
process

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

Introducing the higgsino–zino mixing parameters

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

and rewriting some prefactors, we obtain for the squared amplitude

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath            
              @xmath   
     @xmath            
              @xmath   
     @xmath            
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Here, we already substituted the squared four-momenta by the
corresponding squared particle masses. The other scalar products of the
four-momenta in this process are given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Therefore, we get for the squared amplitude

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

Discarding the terms proportional to the negligible neutrino mass and
taking into account the correct phase space factor, the width for the
decay of the gravitino into the lightest Higgs boson and the tau
neutrino becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the kinematic factor @xmath is given in equation ( C.11 ).

The conjugate process @xmath , that produces tau antineutrinos, has the
same decay width:

  -- -- --

  -- -- -- --------
           (C.24)

## Appendix D PYTHIA Simulation

In this appendix, we present an example of the PYTHIA simulation used to
obtain the spectra of the fragmentation products.

PYTHIA is a Monte Carlo event generator for collider simulations.
Therefore we have to mimic a gravitino decay in a collider setup. To
implement the gravitino in the simulation, we use the optional fourth
fermion generation and redefine the properties of the particles.

The process starts with the exclusive production of a @xmath boson with
mass @xmath in an @xmath collision with a center of mass energy slightly
above twice the gravitino mass. We redefine the decay channels of the
@xmath boson, so that only the decay into @xmath is allowed. The fourth
generation neutrinos @xmath and @xmath are chosen to represent
gravitinos with mass @xmath . In order to have a nonvanishing phase
space for this decay, we chose above a slightly increased center of mass
energy for the initial collision.

Then we define a single decay channel for the @xmath : Either into
@xmath , @xmath or @xmath . The introduction of only one decay channel
at a time allows us to determine the spectra independent of the
branching ratios for the different decay channels. Anyway, these can
easily be added afterwards.

We are interested in the stable final state particles, so we have to
allow all decays of long-lived particles like muons, pions, kaons and
neutrons. By default, PYTHIA regards these particles as stable, since
they do not decay on collider timescales.

In the end we print out a list with the energies of the final state
neutrinos (only one flavor at a time).

The used PYTHIA program is written in FORTRAN 77 and is compiled via the
command

  g77 ’program’.f pythia-6.4.15.f .

This produces an executable file a.out . The event generation is started
via

  a.out > ’output’.dat

and the output data is stored into the file ’output’.dat . The following
code shows the program for the simulation of the decay and fragmentation
of @xmath and the corresponding conjugate process.
