[lines=3,lhang=0.33,nindent=0em] N esta tese são apresentados resultados
sobre dinâmica adiabática (sistemas fechado e aberto) e evoluções não
transicionais que promovem alguns avanços em nosso entendimento sobre
controle quântico e engenharia inversa de Hamiltoniano. No contexto de
evoluções adiabáticas em sistemas fechados é introduzido um mecanismo de
validação para as condições de adiabaticidade estudando a dinâmica do
sistema a partir de um referencial não-inercial. É mostrado como o
cálculo de relevantes condições de aproximação adiabática em diferentes
referenciais (inerciais e não-inerciais) permite prever corretamente o
comportamento adiabático de sistemas quânticos conduzidos por campos
oscilatórios e rotativos. Este mecanismo é aplicável a sistemas
quânticos de muitas partículas em geral, estabelecendo-se as condições
de equivalência do comportamento adiabático conforme descrito por
referênciais inerciais ou não-inerciais. Como aplicação relevante para
dispositivos quânticos modernos, o estudo da adiabaticidade em
diferentes referenciais leva a um protocolo adiabático que garante
processo de carregamento estável de baterias quânticas, o que permite
evitar o regime de descarga espontânea. Considerando um cenário com
decoerência, também são estudadas as condições de validade da
aproximação adiabática. Como um novo resultado geral com possíveis
aplicações é mostrado que sob decoerência a adiabaticidade ainda pode
ocorrer no limite de tempo infinito, como ocorre em sistemas fechados,
para uma classe de estados iniciais. De um ponto de vista de fundamentos
de adiabaticidade em sistemas abertos, essa abordagem geral para
evoluções adiabáticas não-unitárias levam à definições termodinâmicas de
calor e trabalho em termos do superoperador de Liouville, que rege a
dinâmica quântica. Portanto, deriva-se condições sob as quais uma
dinâmica quântica adiabática de sistema aberto implica na ausência de
troca de calor, fornecendo uma conexão entre adiabaticidade quântica e
térmica. Por fim, as contribuições originais desta tese para a teoria
dos atalhos para a adiabaticidade referem-se às abordagens generalizadas
de evoluções não transicionais, onde se explora a liberdade de gauge das
fases quânticas que acompanham as trajetórias adiabáticas. É mostrado
que essas evoluções não transicionais generalizadas podem ser mais
robustas contra a decoerência do que as versões adiabática e
tradicional, mesmo conduzindo o sistema através de campos que fornecem
um esquema mínimo de demanda de energia. As previsões teóricas
apresentadas nesta tese são verificadas experimentalmente através de
dois sistemas experimentais diferentes, a saber, com um qubit codificado
nos níveis de energia hiperfino de um íon de Itérbio aprisionado, e em
ressonância magnética nuclear com um qubit codificado em um spin
nuclear.

## Acknowledgements

Four years ago I started a very hard mission. Along these years a number
of people have made such mission smoother. Firstly, I would like to
thank those people who have held my hands through the most drastic
moments of this long path. To my parents, Zé Almir and Toinha, thank you
so much for being here all of the moments, for not giving up on me when
the things were very hard and for supporting me all the times I needed
your love and attention. To my brothers, Ramon, Saymon and Herisson, for
being so important in my live and for all very nice moments next to you.
You guys are awesome! To end, to Dâmaris for being my best friend, my
guide, my boss, my confidant and for being the love of my life. I’m sure
you do not know how importantly you are to me, how lovely you are. From
now on, I hope to always be by your side to say how much beautiful you
are, how much lovely your eyes are, and how much your smile beautifies
my life. I see my future in your eyes, your so beautiful eyes. To my
parents, brothers and girlfriend, all of you are the reason of
everything.

It is very important to highlight here the role of a number of
researchers who contributed a lot for my academic life and, some of
them, for my personality as researcher. First, for chronological order,
I would like to thank to the experimental groups that helped me along my
PhD. I would like to thank to the first person who believed in my ideas,
Dr. Chang-Kang Hu (University of Science and Technology of China –
USTC). I’m sure that his experimental implementations of my results were
very important to this thesis. My friend, many thanks for all your
support, patience, attention during our collaborations and for teaching
me a bit about the very nice Chinese culture. Moreover, I am grateful to
his lab staff for being part of this collaborations, Dr. Yun-Feng Huang
(his PhD supervisor), Dr. Jin-Ming Cui, Dr. Chuan-Feng Li, and Dr.
Guang-Can Guo. Thank you so much for all your work and support. A second
experimental group that had a very important role to this thesis was the
group of the Dr. Roberto Sarthour (Brazilian Center for Research in
Physics – CBPF). To Dr. Roberto, Dr. Alexandre Souza and to Dr. Ivan
Oliveira, thank you all so much for being so solicitous when requested
and for their hospitality in receiving me at CBPF. Thanks to Amanda
Nicotina for performing part of the experiment and for your support.
There is no words to describe the relevance of the support of these two
experimental groups to my thesis. Thank you so much. I also would like
to thank to Dr. José Huguenin and to Marcello Passos (Exact Sciences
Institute, Federal Fluminense University – ICEx-UFF). Although our
collaborative work does not make part of this thesis, it has great
relevance to me. Moreover, thank you so much for your hospitality and
support when I was in Volta Redonda. To Marcello Passos, thanks for the
coffees, beers and for all our chats.

Again, in a chronological way, I would like to highlight here the people
that believed in my theoretical studies on quantum mechanics and for
helping me to enhance them. I want to thank to Dr. Frederico Brito and
~~ Prof. ~~ Dr. Diogo Soares-Pinto (São Carlos Institute of Physics,
University of São Paulo – IFSC-USP), for their collaborations in two
works presented in this thesis. There is no doubt that their
collaborations were strongly relevant to achieve good results and
discussions. In addition, I have no words to thank all their support and
hospitality when I was in São Carlos for 2 weeks. I wish to thank to Dr.
Barış Çakmak (Bahçeşehir University, Istanbul, Turkey), to Dr. Steve
Campbell (Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland) and to Dr. Nicolaj
Zinner (Aarhus University, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark) for believing in
my ideas and for helping me to enhance them. Our work on stability of
three-level quantum batteries through adiabatic dynamics is my first
independent project, so your collaboration has both academic and
personal important meaning to me. Thank you so much. To end, I am
grateful to Dr. Andreia Saguia (Federal Fluminense University – UFF),
for your interest in my research and for helping me to provide a
generalized study of adiabatic quantum batteries. Thanks for your time,
patience and personal/professional advice.

To end, the man who made this thesis possible, my supervisor Dr. Marcelo
Sarandy. Today I can see that I did not have a supervisor, I had a
friend. Along these six years (since my master degree), I learned a lot
with you. First, I learned how to be student, then how to be a
researcher and, the most important, how to have professional ethics. I’m
very grateful for all your optimism, even when I was not so excited with
my own results, for your patience and wisdom in leading the whole Ph.D.
project. I have no words to thank you for all of chats, personal advice
and professional guidance for the last six years.

Nordeste Independente

Braulio Tavares & Ivanildo Vilanova

Já que existe no sul esse conceito
Que o nordeste é ruim, seco e ingrato
Já que existe a separação de fato
É preciso torná-la de direito
Quando um dia qualquer isso for feito
Todos dois vão lucrar imensamente
Começando uma vida diferente
De que a gente até hoje tem vivido
Imagina o Brasil ser dividido
E o nordeste ficar independente

Dividindo a partir de Salvador
O nordeste seria outro país
Vigoroso, leal, rico e feliz
Sem dever a ninguém no exterior
Jangadeiro seria o senador
O cassaco de roça era o suplente
Cantador de viola, o presidente
O vaqueiro era o líder do partido
Imagina o Brasil ser dividido
E o nordeste ficar independente

Em Recife, o distrito industrial
O idioma ia ser nordestinense
A bandeira de renda cearense
”Asa Branca” era o hino nacional
O folheto era o símbolo oficial
A moeda, o tostão de antigamente
Conselheiro seria o inconfidente
Lampião, o herói inesquecido
Imagina o Brasil ser dividido
E o nordeste ficar independente

O Brasil ia ter de importar
Do nordeste algodão, cana, caju
Carnaúba, laranja, babaçu
Abacaxi e o sal de cozinhar
O arroz, o agave do lugar
O petróleo, a cebola, o aguardente
O nordeste é auto-suficiente
O seu lucro seria garantido
Imagina o Brasil ser dividido
E o nordeste ficar independente

Se isso aí se tornar realidade
E alguém do Brasil nos visitar
Nesse nosso país vai encontrar
Confiança, respeito e amizade
Tem o pão repartido na metade
Temo prato na mesa, a cama quente
Brasileiro será irmão da gente
Vai pra lá que será bem recebido
Imagina o Brasil ser dividido
E o nordeste ficar independente

Eu não quero, com isso, que vocês
Imaginem que eu tento ser grosseiro
Pois se lembrem que o povo brasileiro
É amigo do povo português
Se um dia a separação se fez
Todos os dois se respeitam no presente
Se isso aí já deu certo antigamente
Nesse exemplo concreto e conhecido
Imagina o Brasil ser dividido
E o nordeste ficar independente

## Chapter \thechapter Introduction \lettrine

[lines=3,lhang=0.33,nindent=0em] A diabatic dynamics [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]
provides a powerful technique widely explored for a number of
applications in quantum mechanics that demand our ability of perfectly
controlling a quantum system. By definition, the adiabatic dynamics
(also called, adiabatic approximation) of a system driven by a
time-dependent Hamiltonian @xmath is achieved when the system dynamics
(approximately) undergoes a trajectory in Hilbert space in which the
instantaneous eigenstates of the Hamiltonian do not evolve coupled to
each other [ 1 , 2 ] . That means, if the system starts with some
superposition of stationary states of @xmath , then the system is said
to undergo an adiabatic dynamics if such superposition is kept (up to
phases) for the corresponding stationary states of @xmath for all later
times @xmath . Such kind of dynamics has been applied in the context of
quantum computation [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] , digitized quantum computing [ 8
, 9 , 10 ] , state engineering [ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 ] , among others
[ 16 ] . Adiabatic quantum computing has been investigated as a possible
candidate to build high technology quantum processors with manufactured
artificial spins, such as the D-Wave quantum computer [ 17 , 18 ] . In
such system the input state is the lowest-energy state of a tunneling
Hamiltonian , where all qubits of the system are in a superposition of
@xmath and @xmath . Then, the system is driven by a time dependent Ising
Hamiltonian with a transverse field, where the final state of the system
is a classical state associated with the lowest-energy state of a
problem Hamiltonian . The problem Hamiltonian allows us to adjust the
local fields (along the quantization axis) acting on each qubit, as well
as the coupling between them. In order to provide a quantum annealing,
the driven Hamiltonian interpolate the tunneling and problem
Hamiltonians, where the problem Hamiltonian becomes effective meanwhile
the influence of the tunneling one is reduced. However, the performance
of adiabatic dynamics in achieving some tasks with high fidelity is
strongly affected by the competition between the total evolution time
(as imposed by the adiabaticity conditions [ 19 , 20 , 21 ] ) and the
decohering time-scale of real physical systems (relaxation, dephasing,
etc). When the inevitable environment-system coupling is taken into
account, the performance of the adiabatic dynamics depends on the basis
in which the decoherence acts, with some enhancement of the robustness
of the protocol usually achievable when the decohering effects take
place in the instantaneous energy eigenbasis [ 22 ] . More precisely, in
this context the notion of adiabatic dynamics differs from the closed
system case due to fundamental issues. Indeed, given the interaction
with some environment, the system dynamics is governed by master
equations that take into account the non-unitary effects due to such
interaction [ 23 , 24 ] . Although the adiabatic approximation in open
systems takes into account contributions of the Hamiltonian @xmath , it
takes into account system-environment interaction as well [ 25 ] .
Hence, undesired effects will drastically change the system state when
the decohering effects do not take place in a preferred basis [ 22 ] .
However, independently of the existence of a preferable decohering
basis, we need to consider some alternative approach to deal with these
undesired effects. A widely used approach to bypass this problem is the
shortcut to adiabaticity based on transitionless quantum driving (TQD),
as conceived by M. Demirplak and S. Rice [ 26 , 27 ] .

Shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) consist of a set of methods able to
significantly speed up an dynamics so that the initial and final state
are the same as obtained by an adiabatic dynamics. Such approaches have
been proposed in context of inverse Hamiltonian engineering, where we
add fields in order to achieve initial and target states of the system,
with applications to state engineering [ 28 ] , tracking of many-body
systems across quantum phase transitions [ 29 , 30 ] , quantum computing
[ 31 , 10 , 32 , 33 ] , quantum thermodynamics [ 34 ] , among others [
35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 ] . TQD is a specific STA, where the path
followed by the system from initial to final state is an adiabatic
trajectory of some reference time-dependent Hamiltonian @xmath . While a
general STA can be obtained for any faster orbit than the adiabatic one,
the TQD method drives the system along the exact adiabatic trajectory,
for this reason we use the term “transitionless”, denoting that the
system does not make transitions between different instantaneous
eigenstates of @xmath , but it is driven by a different Hamiltonian
called transitionless Hamiltonian. TQD has been applied to a number of
quantum tasks, such as state engineering [ 41 , 42 , 43 ] , quantum
computing [ 44 , 10 , 32 , 33 ] , thermal engines [ 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ]
, relativistic quantum mechanical dynamics [ 49 ] , among others [ 39 ,
40 ] . As proposed by Demirplak and Rice (also investigated by M. V.
Berry [ 50 ] ), the TQD method consists of an dynamics where the system
is driven by a sum of fields, namely the adiabatic fields used to
implement @xmath plus auxiliary fields used to implement the
counter-diabatic Hamiltonian @xmath . As its nomenclature suggests,
@xmath inhibits diabatic transitions that happens when @xmath drives the
system without any constraints imposed by the validity conditions of the
adiabatic theorem. Due to the additional fields, the energy cost for
implementing TQD are increased and it depends on the how faster the
system is driven [ 10 ] , so that we can establish a trade-off between
speed and energy cost of implementing such shortcut [ 51 ] . Then, any
advantage of the usage of the TQD method comes with some additional
energy expenditure to implement it. [ 10 , 51 ] . In return, it is
important to highlight that speeding up the dynamics implies in a more
robust dynamics against a number of decohering environment and
systematic errors . In summary, it would be appreciated if we get a new
TQD approach that allows us for achieving the same robustness as the
standard ¹ ¹ 1 From now on we will use the terminology “standard” to
refer to the TQD method proposed by Demirplak and Rice. TQD, but with
low-cost energy fields.

In this thesis we focus on advances in adiabatic quantum mechanics
theory (closed and open systems) and TQD theory, by exploring a
generalized approach for the TQD. The motivation of the original studies
and applications presented in this thesis are structured as follows.

In context of adiabatic dynamics in closed systems, besides the
significant number of applications of adiabatic dynamics previously
mentioned, it remains an open problem the conditions that allow us to
guarantee the adiabatic approximation. As we shall see in more details,
there are a large number of works in the literature trying to solve this
problem by proposing different validity conditions to adiabaticity
(ACs). In theory, when ACs are satisfied then the adiabatic
approximation should be achieved with high fidelity. However, it has
been proved that some widely used ACs are neither necessary nor
sufficient in guaranteeing any prediction of the adiabatic behavior [ 52
] . By necessary , we mean that if the desired behavior is obtained then
the condition at hands is necessarily satisfied ; by sufficient we mean
that if such condition is satisfied then it should be sufficient to say
that the adiabatic approximation is achieved with high fidelity. The
search for necessary and sufficient ACs has led to a number of
discussions about the existence of necessary and sufficient conditions
to adiabaticity [ 53 , 54 , 55 , 20 , 19 , 56 , 57 ] as well as new
bounds for adiabaticity [ 58 , 59 , 60 ] . Then in this thesis we
introduce a validation mechanism for the adiabatic approximation by
driving the quantum system to a non-inertial reference frame [ 61 ] . To
this end, first we consider several relevant adiabatic approximation
conditions previously derived and show that all of them fail by
introducing a suitable oscillating Hamiltonian for a single quantum bit
(qubit). Then, by evaluating the adiabatic condition in a rotated
non-inertial frame, we show that all of these conditions, including the
standard adiabatic condition, can correctly describe the actual dynamics
in the original frame, either far from resonance or at a resonant point.
We show how such mechanism is applicable to general multi-particle
quantum systems, establishing the conditions for the equivalence of the
adiabatic behavior as described in inertial or non-inertial frames. As a
practical application of the study of adiabaticity, we apply our results
to charging process of a quantum battery (QB). Among fundamental
challenges for useful QBs are both the control of the energy transfer
and the stability of the discharge process to an available consumption
hub. Indeed, a fully operational loss-free QB requires an inherent
control over the energy transfer process, with the ability of keeping
the energy retained with no leakage. In this sense, we exploit an
adiabatic protocol to ensure a stable charged state of QBs which allows
one to avoid the spontaneous discharging regime. Our results are firstly
applied to a three-level quantum system in a ladder-type configuration [
62 ] , then we propose a general design for a QB based on a power
observable quantifying the energy transfer rate to a consumption hub [
63 ] . As main applications of the power observable, we introduce a
trapping energy mechanism for QBs and an asymptotically stable discharge
mechanism , which is achieved through an adiabatic evolution eventually
yielding vanishing power.

By considering decohering effects on the system dynamics, we study the
validity conditions of the adiabatic approximation. First we review some
elements introduced in Ref. [ 25 ] , then as a general result we show
that the adiabatic approximation in open system may still occur in the
infinite time limit, as it happens for closed systems, for a class of
initial quantum states. Our results can be viewed as a complementary
discussion to the results presented in Refs. [ 25 , 5 ] , where the
authors argued that open system adiabaticity is typically expected to
occur at finite time. As a practical application, we implement the
adiabatic quantum algorithm for the Deutsch problem, where a distinction
is established between the open system adiabatic density operator and
the target pure state expected in the computation process. Preferred
time windows for obtaining the desired outcomes are then analyzed. On
the other hand, from the viewpoint of basic studies on adiabaticity in
open systems, here we theoretically study thermodynamic adiabatic
processes in open quantum systems, which evolve nonunitarily under
decoherence due to its interaction with its surrounding environment.
From the general approach for adiabatic non-unitary evolution, we
establish heat and work in terms of the underlying Liouville
superoperator governing the quantum dynamics. In this scenario,
thermodynamic processes with no heat exchange, namely, adiabatic
transformations, can be implemented through quantum evolutions in closed
systems, even though the notion of a closed system is always an
idealization and approximation. As a consequence, we establish a
detailed study on adiabatic evolutions (dynamics) and adiabatic
processes (thermodynamics), where we derive the conditions such that an
adiabatic open-system quantum dynamics implies in the absence of heat
exchange, providing a connection between quantum and thermal
adiabaticity.

As a last set of results, we present a generalized approach of TQD in
closed systems by exploring the gauge freedom of the quantal phases that
accompany an adiabatic trajectory. In fact, there is a number of
situations for which we need not exactly mimic an adiabatic process, but
only assure that the system is kept in an instantaneous eigenstate
(independently of its associated quantum phase) [ 10 , 32 , 33 , 64 , 65
, 66 , 49 , 67 , 68 , 42 , 69 , 70 , 41 ] . Therefore, we can suitably
choose some dynamics in which the adiabatic phase is replaced for
generalized quantal phases @xmath . This provides us a generalized TQD
Hamiltonian that depends on a number of free parameters and such
parameters can be chosen in order to optimize some physical quantity or
process. For example, in this thesis we show situations in which the
generalized TQD Hamiltonian is both time-independent and optimal energy
cost demanding concerning the adiabatic and standard TQD Hamiltonian. As
an application of the results, we realize feasible time-independent TQD
Hamiltonians [ 71 ] , which provide the optimal dynamics concerning both
their experimental viability and energy cost, as measured by the
strength of the counter-diabatic fields required by the implementation [
43 ] and by the optimal pulse sequence required to implement some
quantum task [ 72 ] . The energy-optimal protocol presented here is
potentially useful for speeding up digitized adiabatic quantum computing
[ 73 , 8 ] . Since digitized adiabatic quantum computing requires the
Trotterization of the adiabatic dynamics, our protocol could be useful
in reducing the number of steps used in digital adiabatic quantum
processes. In addition, such process is independent of the experimental
approach used to digitize the adiabatic quantum evolution.

A number of theoretical predictions presented in this thesis are
experimentally implemented in two different experimental setups. By
using a two-level system encoded in the hyperfine energy structure of a
single Ytterbium trapped ion, driven by external microwave fields, we
experimentally explore the validation mechanism of the adiabatic theorem
in both closed and open systems and the performance of optimal TQD
Hamiltonians as provided by the generalized TQD theory. From the
experimental novelty side, we report two distinct realizations. In the
context of generalized TQD, the experimental realization allowed us to
check the fields used to implement an optimal TQD is in fact less
intense than the fields used to implement the adiabatic and standard TQD
version of the dynamics. In context of the realization of an adiabatic
open-system evolution, we use the hyperfine qubit of the Ytterbium
trapped ion as our work substance for our application to thermodynamics.
Our implementation exhibits high controllability, opening perspectives
for analyzing thermal machines (or refrigerators) in open quantum
systems under adiabatic evolutions. Due to the requirements of the usual
definitions of heat and work, the investigation of thermodynamic
quantities in adiabatic dynamics is achieved with time-dependent
decoherence effects. To this end, it is introduced an efficient control
to a Gaussian noise with time-dependent amplitude, which is then used to
simulate a dephasing channel with a time-dependent decoherece rate
@xmath . We stress here that we focus on superficial details of the
experimental setup used in our work, but a detailed description of the
system can be found in Chang-kang Hu’s PhD thesis [ 74 ] . The second
experimental setup used here is a nuclear spin system driven by nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) experimental setup. Our experimental
investigation shows the performance of a generalized approach for TQD to
implement shortcuts to adiabaticity in NMR. We show that the generalized
TQD theory requires less energy resources, with the strength of the
magnetic field less than that required by standard TQD. As a second
discussion, we analyze the experimental implementation of shortcuts to
single-qubit adiabatic gates. By adopting generalized TQD, we can
provide feasible time-independent driving Hamiltonians, which are
optimized in terms of the number of pulses used to implement the quantum
dynamics. The robustness of adiabatic and generalized TQD evolutions
against typical decoherence processes in NMR is also analyzed.

### 1 Mathematical framework, notation and conventions

In this section we present some important notations and conventions we
use throughout this thesis.

#### 1.1 Matrix operations: Exponential and Logarithm of a matrix

When we work with numbers (real @xmath or complex @xmath ) and how a
number can be connected to another one, the notion of functions is a
“natural” consequence. Thus, we can define a function @xmath as an
application @xmath that takes an element @xmath defined on a space
@xmath and it associates to this element a second one @xmath defined on
a space @xmath . Then, we write @xmath . More specifically, by choosing
the domain of each element it is possible to define scalar, vector and
matrix functions. Therefore, let @xmath be a matrix space whose elements
@xmath are diagonalizable @xmath -matrices with eigenvalues @xmath and
eigenvectors @xmath . Therefore, a matrix function @xmath is defined as
@xmath . It is important to highlight that we can express a matrix
function through its power series representation

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (1)
  -- -------- -- -----

where we assume the existence of the derivatives in the above equation.
Now, it is possible to define a number of interesting and useful matrix
equations. First, again let us consider a matrix @xmath with eigenvalues
@xmath associated with eigenvectors @xmath . Thus, we define the
exponential of @xmath , which is denoted by @xmath or @xmath . Then, by
using the Eq. ( 1 ) we can write

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (2)
  -- -------- -- -----

and therefore we conclude that

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (3)
  -- -------- -- -----

The notion of exponential of a matrix is a highly useful mathematical
tool for many tasks in quantum physics, since the unitary evolution of
quantum systems is described by such mathematical elements [ 75 ] . In
particular, it is convenient to write the matrix form of @xmath in the
eigenbasis @xmath of @xmath as

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (4)
  -- -------- -- -----

where we already used that @xmath . On the other hand, we can define the
natural logarithm function of a matrix as

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (5)
  -- -------- -- -----

which should be valid for any matrix @xmath . However, here we can write
@xmath in basis @xmath

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (6)
  -- -------- -- -----

However, a first remark here is that the above equation is valid up to a
condition on the spectrum of @xmath . In particular, @xmath is not well
defined, because @xmath . This means that Eqs. ( 5 ) and ( 5 ) hold for
nonsingular matrices @xmath

#### 1.2 The density matrix

A @xmath -dimensional quantum system is fully described through a matrix
@xmath called density matrix . As any matrix, @xmath may be written from
a predefined matrix basis @xmath as

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (7)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath are parameters to be determined. Thus, assuming that @xmath
describes a quantum system, it should satisfy the normalization
condition @xmath , so that it leads us to a condition on the
coefficients @xmath as

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (8)
  -- -------- -- -----

In particular, there is a convenient choice of the parameters @xmath and
matrices @xmath so that the above condition is satisfied. Throughout
this thesis we will use the basis @xmath , where @xmath is a set of
@xmath ( @xmath )-dimensional traceless matrices ² ² 2 We say that a
matrix @xmath is said to be traceless matrix when @xmath . . Thus, from
Eq. ( 8 ) we can identify @xmath so that @xmath could be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (9)
  -- -------- -- -----

Let us consider a second condition on the matrices @xmath associated
with orthogonality the between the elements of @xmath , namely, let us
consider a basis in which

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (10)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the Hermitian conjugate of @xmath and @xmath is the
Kronecker’s delta ³ ³ 3 @xmath when @xmath and @xmath otherwise. . From
this consideration, we easily can find each coefficient @xmath of @xmath
and @xmath by computing

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (11)
  -- -------- -- ------

where we can use that @xmath and @xmath to get

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (12)
  -- -------- -- ------

Finally, if we adopt a traceless matrix basis @xmath that satisfies
@xmath , the density matrix can be written as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (13)
  -- -------- -- ------

with @xmath . As an example, let us consider the set of the Pauli
matrices given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (14)
  -- -------- -- ------

Evidently we can note that the above matrices constitute a set of
Hermitian traceless matrices. In addition, by using the relation (
@xmath )

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (15)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the Levi-Civita’s symbol defined as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (16)
  -- -------- -- ------

one finds that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (17)
  -- -------- -- ------

Therefore, we conclude that the set of Pauli matrices can be used as a
matrix basis for a two-level system and we write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (18)
  -- -------- -- ------

where we define the matrix Pauli vector @xmath , with @xmath being the
canonical basis of the @xmath Euclidean space, and the coherence vector
@xmath for a two-level system.

### 2 Quantum mechanics in superoperator formalism

In the theory of open systems, the dynamics of a quantum system @xmath
coupled to an environment is generically described by a master equation
that takes into account the system-environment interaction. In
particular, here we consider the class of evolution where the system
dynamics is described by the time-local master equation [ 76 , 23 ]

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (19)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the generator of the dynamics and the subscript “ @xmath
” makes explicit the possibility of time-dependency of the parameters
associated with the environment. As the element @xmath is an operation
that leads an operator @xmath to another @xmath , where @xmath is the
Hilbert space of the system @xmath , we call @xmath a superoperator . We
can deal with the above dynamics in different ways, but here we will
consider the case in which we define an extended space where the
superoperator becomes an @xmath -dimensional operator @xmath and the
operators (density matrix and observables, for example) become
(super-)vectors @xmath in this new space.

To see how it can be done, we define a set of @xmath operators @xmath ,
so that @xmath and @xmath . As already discussed, @xmath can be written
in form given in Eq. ( 13 ), where the identity is introduced here as a
@xmath -dimensional operator of this basis in order to satisfy the
property @xmath , so that we define @xmath . As an example we consider a
two-level system, in which a complete basis @xmath for this system would
be @xmath , so that the coherence vector reads as in Eq. ( 18 ).
Obviously we could consider other choices for @xmath , depending on the
convenience of our choice. Thus, if we substitute @xmath in Eq. ( 19 )
by using the expanded form of the Eq. ( 13 ), we find the system of
differential equations

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (20)
  -- -------- -- ------

where we assume that @xmath is a linear superoperator. Note that if we
identify the coefficient @xmath in the above equation as an element at
@xmath -th row and @xmath -th column of a @xmath -dimensional matrix
@xmath , one can write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (21)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is a @xmath -dimensional vector with components @xmath ,
@xmath . In an analogous way to the coherence vector @xmath of the
two-level system, we will call @xmath the coherence vector . In
addition, in this formalism, the inner product between two density
matrices @xmath and @xmath from their coherence vectors @xmath and
@xmath is defined as @xmath , where the conjugate coherence vector
@xmath has components given by @xmath .

Since we have a set of new coherence vectors @xmath , it is convenient
to provide a basis for such vector space. Given the basis of operators
@xmath , one defines the basis of coherence vectors as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (22)
  -- -------- -- ------

so that we can use @xmath to write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (23)
  -- -------- -- ------

which constitutes the set of @xmath linearly independent vectors on the
vector space, so that any coherence vector @xmath can be written as a
linear combination of the vectors in the set @xmath .

An important remark is that, due to the non-Hermiticity of the operator
@xmath , the superoperator @xmath may not be diagonalizable.
Nevertheless, non-Hermitian operators can always be written in the
Jordan canonical form, where @xmath displays a block-diagonal structure
@xmath composed by Jordan blocks @xmath associated with different
time-dependent eigenvalues @xmath of @xmath [ 77 ] . Then, firstly we
define the following.

###### Definition \thechapter.1 (Jordan block form).

Given a @xmath matrix @xmath , the Jordan block form of @xmath reads

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (24)
  -- -------- -- ------

where each block @xmath is given by an upper triangular matrix of the
form

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (25)
  -- -------- -- ------

with @xmath denoting the eigenvalues of @xmath . Alternatively, a @xmath
Jordan matrix @xmath can be denoted as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (26)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the number of Jordan block required to write @xmath in a
Jordan block form.

In some cases, the coefficients @xmath may depend on other parameters
(time, for example). Then, by assuming that the coefficients @xmath
depend on a complete set of parameter @xmath , we denote the Jordan
matrix as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (27)
  -- -------- -- ------

The notion of Jordan form is important here because, different from the
generator of a unitary dynamics (the Hamiltonian), the generator of the
dynamics in an open system @xmath does not admit a diagonal form in
general. However, every square matrix @xmath can be diagonalized by
blocks from the Jordan canonical form theorem [ 77 ] .

###### Theorem \thechapter.1 (Jordan canonical form theorem).

Let be @xmath , where @xmath is a set of @xmath square matrix. Then,
there is a non-singular matrix @xmath , positive integers @xmath and
@xmath with @xmath , and scalars @xmath so that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (28)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is a Jordan matrix associated with @xmath .

Now, by using the above discussion to the superoperator @xmath , we can
write its Jordan form through the matrix @xmath which allows us to write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (29)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the number of distinct eigenvalues @xmath of @xmath and
each block @xmath is a @xmath -dimensional matrix given as in Eq. ( 25
). Since the Hilbert space of the system has dimension @xmath , one
finds @xmath . In addition, as an immediate consequence of the structure
of @xmath , one see that @xmath does not admit the existence of
eigenvectors. Instead eigenvectors, we define right @xmath and left
quasi-eigenvectors @xmath of @xmath associated with the eigenvalue
@xmath , satisfying

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (30a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (30b)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

The set @xmath combined with @xmath constitutes a basis for the space
associated with the operator @xmath and satisfies the normalization
condition @xmath and completeness relation

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (31)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the number of Jordan blocks in Eq. ( 29 ) and @xmath is
the dimension of the @xmath -th Jordan block.

## Chapter \thechapter Adiabatic dynamics in closed quantum systems
\lettrine

[lines=3,lhang=0.33,nindent=0em] I n this chapter we will discuss the
adiabatic dynamics in closed quantum systems and the validity of the
conditions of the adiabatic theorem. We start this chapter by defining
the notion of adiabaticity in closed systems and providing a review on
some known adiabaticity conditions (AC’s) and their validity in
guaranteeing the adiabatic behavior of a quantum system with
non-degenerate time-dependent Hamiltonian @xmath . It is important to
mention that necessary and sufficient conditions to adiabatic dynamics
are not a closed subject. In recent years, it has been proposed
theoretical and experimental studies of how to deal with the adiabatic
behavior for a particular class of time-dependent Hamiltonian, in which
the widely used proposal of AC’s do not work. After that, we introduce a
new strategy that can be used to recover the ability of AC’s in
predicting the adiabatic behavior of a number of Hamiltonians. For this
reason, we call it a validation mechanism for AC’s. As a useful
application, we discuss how the study of adiabatic dynamics in the
rotating frame allows us for providing a stable charging/discharging
process of quantum batteries. Quantum batteries are quantum devices used
to store energy to be transferred to some consumption hub whenever
required, where their charging/discharging performance (power) explores
quantum resources, like coherence and entanglement. The contributions of

### 3 Review on validity conditions of the adiabatic theorem

Let us consider a quantum system @xmath driven by a time-dependent
(non-degenerate) Hamiltonian @xmath , its dynamics is dictated by
Schrödinger equation

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (32)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the reduced Planck’s constant ( @xmath , where @xmath is
the Planck’s constant). The set of eigenstates and energies of @xmath
are denoted as @xmath and @xmath , respectively. In closed quantum
systems, the notion of an adiabatic dynamics is well-defined and widely
used in several situations and studies, therefore, we shall use it here.
An initial definition of adiabaticity is associated with an independent
(uncoupled) dynamics of the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with energy
@xmath . Thus, if we start the system in a particular eigenstate @xmath
with energy @xmath , the definition of adiabaticity establishes that at
a later instant @xmath the state of the system will be the updated
eigenstate @xmath with energy @xmath . From a more rigorous way, we can
define adiabaticity from the viewpoint of the Hilbert space of the
system as follows [ 21 ] .

###### Definition \thechapter.1 (Adiabatic dynamics).

Given a quantum system @xmath evolving under a time-dependent @xmath ,
the system dynamics is said to be adiabatic if the dynamics of its
Hilbert space @xmath can be decomposed into uncoupled Schrödinger
eigenspaces with distinct, and non-crossing instantaneous eigenvalues of
@xmath .

By Schrödinger eigenspaces we mean an @xmath -dimensional complex vector
space, whose basis is composed by the @xmath (orthonormal) eigenvectors
of @xmath with the same eigenvalue. Of course, the number of eigenspaces
is constrained to the dimension of the Hilbert space @xmath . In the
case where the Hamiltonian is non-degenerated, Schrödinger eigenspaces
become one-dimensional. The adiabatic dynamics is not a general property
of quantum systems and it cannot be achieved in any situation. Thus, the
main question that arises is: what is (are) the condition(s) to achieve
the adiabatic dynamics in quantum systems? The answer to this question
lead us to the so-called adiabaticity conditions (AC’s). AC’s are a set
of conditions (or a single condition) that should be satisfied for any
system which follows an adiabatic dynamics.

A first validity condition to adiabatic theorem was initially derived by
P. Ehrenfest [ 78 ] , after by M. Born and V. Fock [ 2 ] and then by T.
Kato [ 1 ] many years later. These works introduced the traditional AC
given by adiabatic parameter

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (33)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the adiabatic dynamics would be achieved whenever @xmath [ 78 , 2
, 1 , 21 ] .

In 2004, Marzlin and Sanders provided a counter-example in which the
above condition fails in guaranteeing the adiabatic behavior [ 79 ] . To
this end, Marzlin and Sanders investigated the dynamics of a Hamiltonian
identical to that of a @xmath -spin particle in a rotating magnetic
field in @xmath -plane. In fact, let us consider the Hamiltonian @xmath
which describes the coupling between the @xmath -spin particle to a
time-dependent magnetic field @xmath , where @xmath is the magnetic
dipole momentum and @xmath is the @xmath -spin “vector” operator, with
@xmath . Therefore, in case where @xmath , i.e., a rotating magnetic
field in @xmath -plane, we get the Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (34)
  -- -------- -- ------

In case where the transverse field intensity @xmath is much less intense
than the longitudinal field @xmath , we write @xmath . The fundamental
and excited states of @xmath are, respectively, given by

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (35a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (35b)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

with energies @xmath , where @xmath . Since we are considering @xmath ,
@xmath is a small parameter and, therefore, it means the fundamental
state of the system can be written as @xmath . Thus, by considering the
system is initialized in the fundamental state of @xmath , we can write
@xmath , then we write @xmath . The dynamics of the system driven by
above Hamiltonian in Eq. ( 34 ) is given by (see Appendix A ).

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (36)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the Hamiltonian in the rotating frame provided by
transformation @xmath and it is given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (37)
  -- -------- -- ------

Thus, by defining the projector @xmath , the probability of the system
to be found at state @xmath is given by (here @xmath )

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (38)
  -- -------- -- ------

where we define @xmath as a resonant approximation ratio, that is, when
@xmath we are close to resonance situation, otherwise we are far-from
resonance (or in an intermediate stage). From Eq. ( 38 ), it is worth
highlighting the maximum and minimum fidelity times as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (39)
  -- -------- -- ------

where

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (40)
  -- -------- -- ------

As result, one can see that the minimum fidelity depends on the rf-field
configuration. Therefore, now we study three different dynamics
associated with near and far from resonance configuration of the
rf-field.

Situation 1: Spin dynamics at resonance ( @xmath ) – In this limit the
above equation reads

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (41)
  -- -------- -- ------

so that for each instant @xmath , for @xmath the probability of
approximately finding the system at the fundamental state (state @xmath
) is zero. Now, note that there is no adiabaticity and it just depends
on the limit @xmath .

Situation 2: Spin dynamics for very-slowly oscillating rf-field ( @xmath
) – As a first far-from situation we can consider the case where @xmath
, in which the Eq. ( 38 ) becomes (the superscript “ffr” means far-from
resonance)

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (42)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the minimum and maximum value of @xmath are @xmath and @xmath ,
respectively. Therefore, since we are considering that @xmath , so the
parameter @xmath and hence @xmath . It means that for a very-slowly
oscillating rf-field we are close to the fundamental state and
adiabaticity is approximately obtained.

Situation 3: Spin dynamics for highly oscillating rf-field ( @xmath ) –
Now, in the limit of high oscillating rf-field, we can write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (43)
  -- -------- -- ------

in which we are neglecting terms smaller than @xmath . It is a bit
counter-intuitive because we have a highly oscillating field driven the
system through an adiabatic path (approximately).

Now, given that we know the exact solution for the dynamics of the
system (consequently the transition probabilities), let us compute each
AC in order to verify their validation. First, the traditional
adiabaticity condition in Eq. ( 33 ) to the above dynamics reads

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (44)
  -- -------- -- ------

The above equation presents a strictly increasing linear behavior of the
quantity @xmath as function of @xmath . Regarding the Situations 1 and 3
above, the prediction of the adiabaticity as provided by @xmath is not
valid. In particular, in this case, the traditional condition is neither
sufficient and nor necessary condition to predict adiabaticity. In fact,
the Situation 1 shows that we do not have adiabaticity even when the
parameter @xmath is small (concerning its value for other choices of
@xmath ). Therefore, it means the traditional condition is not
sufficient to guarantee adiabaticity. On the other hand, Situation 3
shows that we have adiabaticity when @xmath is not small (since @xmath ,
then it is possible to find @xmath so that @xmath ). Here, one concludes
that the traditional condition is not necessary to get adiabaticity.

After Marzlin and Sanders results, other works discussed about the
viability of using quantitative conditions to guarantee the validity of
the adiabatic theorem in quantum systems. D. M. Tong et al [ 55 ] showed
that quantitative conditions do not guarantee the validity of the
adiabatic theorem, where they provide a revision of the results
presented by Marzlin and Sanders. In order to solve that problem, D. M.
Tong et al [ 58 ] provided a new condition (actually, a set of
conditions) which should guarantee the adiabatic approximation when
satisfied. Without loss of generality we can write the set of conditions
as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
                          
     @xmath               (45a)
     @xmath               (45b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (45c)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where ( 45a ) is exactly the traditional condition ( 33 ), but @xmath
and @xmath are two additional conditions introduced in Ref. [ 58 ] .
Here the index “ @xmath ” in @xmath denotes the mean value of @xmath in
the interval @xmath . Here it is worth mentioning that some years after
Ref. [ 58 ] , D. M. Tong authored a paper [ 56 ] where he argued how
quantitative conditions could be necessary to guarantee the validity of
the adiabatic approximation, but no discussion about the sufficiency is
considered in. Since adiabaticity is achieved whenever all the above
conditions satisfy @xmath , then here we can define the Tong’s
coefficient from set of coefficient in Eq. ( 45 ) as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (46)
  -- -------- -- ------

so that @xmath would be enough in guaranteeing adiabaticity. Without
more calculations, we can conclude that the Tong’s conditions are not
satisfied to the Marzlin-Sanders Hamiltonian in Eq. ( 34 ), since the
condition @xmath will provide the same result as in Eq. ( 44 ).

A third interesting AC to be considered here is the AC as provided by
Jian-da Wu et al [ 80 ] , where the authors introduced the notion of
quantum geometric potential associated with an adiabatic path, also
called adiabatic orbit in Ref. [ 80 ] . The Wu’s condition establishes
that an @xmath -level quantum system can follow an adiabatic orbit with
fidelity (probability) @xmath if

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (47)
  -- -------- -- ------

with @xmath being the geometrical Berry’s phase [ 81 ] and @xmath the
the previously mentioned quantum geometric potential [ 80 ] given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (48)
  -- -------- -- ------

Since the above equation allows us to determinate the probability of
finding the system following an adiabatic orbit as function of @xmath ,
it is reasonable to adopt @xmath for guaranteeing that we will get an
adiabatic dynamics with high probability. By assuming that, here we
consider the Wu’s AC as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (49)
  -- -------- -- ------

which should satisfy @xmath for an adiabatic behavior. Basically, the
Wu’s condition requires we need to take the traditional AC and replace
the term @xmath for @xmath instead. Therefore, due the new term @xmath ,
it is convenient to study whether @xmath allows us to describe the
Marzlin-Sanders Hamiltonian dynamics. Thus, we can write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (50)
  -- -------- -- ------

where we already used the Eqs ( 35 ). Due the non-trivial behavior of
@xmath concerning the resonance ratio @xmath , we will analyze its
validity to describe the adiabatic dynamics after we present the last AC
to be considered in this thesis.

To end, we discuss now the AC derived by Andris Ambainis and Oded Regev
[ 54 ] . An important element in Ambainis-Regev AC is associated with a
parameter @xmath which quantifies the spacing between instantaneous
energy @xmath , associated with the target eigenstate of @xmath , and
the its adjacent energy levels @xmath and @xmath . For example, a
possible choice of the parameter @xmath could be @xmath . Therefore,
given our choice on @xmath , the Ambainis-Regev condition establishes
that, given the quantity if we get

  -- -- -- ------
           (51)
  -- -- -- ------

so the instantaneous evolved state @xmath will be close to eigenstate
@xmath , where the distance between each other is @xmath . In order to
write the Ambainis-Regev AC in terms of an adiabaticity coefficient
@xmath , we consider

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (52)
  -- -------- -- ------

where we neglected the term @xmath because we are interested here in
qualitative characteristic of the AC’s. That is, we expect that near to
resonance the AC’s provide bigger values concerning that one obtained
far-from resonance. For this reason, the term @xmath does not develop a
important role in our study. Thus, by applying the above condition to
the Marzlin-Sanders Hamiltonian, we obtain

  -- -- -- ------
           (53)
  -- -- -- ------

since we have a two-level system we already wrote @xmath .

In order to make a comparison between the AC considered here, in Fig. 1
we present each quantity computed to the Hamiltonian in Eq. ( 34 ). From
Eq. ( 38 ), the adiabatic behavior is obtained when the parameter @xmath
is large enough so that the oscillatory contribution of the co-sine
function Eq. ( 38 ) can be neglected, otherwise the oscillations will
provide small values of the probability and it means we do not have
adiabaticity. Now, we can study this phenomenon under viewpoint of the
ACs shown in Fig. 1 , where the same parameters are also considered in
Ref. [ 52 ] .

Firstly, let us focus on the situation in which we have large values for
@xmath . For this range of values for @xmath , adiabaticity is observed
and the AC should describe such phenomena. However, the graphs in Fig. 1
shows that the conditions @xmath and @xmath suggest we should not get
the adiabatic behavior, while the conditions @xmath and @xmath presents
a consistent (expected) behavior. This analysis suggests that the
conditions @xmath and @xmath are not necessary conditions to guarantee
adiabaticity, since the system evolves through an adiabatic path even
when such conditions do not indicate such phenomenon. On the other side,
in case where we have small values for @xmath , the conditions @xmath
and @xmath present inconsistency with the Eq. ( 38 ), at the same time
that the conditions @xmath and @xmath shows an expected behavior. As
conclusion, it is possible to see that the conditions @xmath and @xmath
are not sufficient in guaranteeing adiabaticity.

While the traditional adiabatic parameter is neither necessary nor
sufficient to guarantee adiabaticity, apparently the Tong’s conditions
seems to be both necessary and sufficient to predict adiabaticity. Here
we are using the term “apparently” because we are not able to confirm
such result in general. By the way, we shall see that all of the above
conditions are neither necessary nor sufficient to predict adiabaticity.

### 4 Frame-dependence of the adiabatic parameters

In general, the quantities presented in Eqs. ( 33 ), ( 46 ), ( 49 )
and ( 52 ) are computed taking into account that no frame transformation
into Schrödinger’s equation is computed. We mean, either the system
Hamiltonian is written taking into account the laboratory frame or no
frame is explicitly considered. We just compute them. For example, when
one writes the NMR Hamiltonian given in Eq. ( 34 ), so it is intrinsic
that we are computing the system energy for the Laboratory frame.
However, when we consider the time-dependent transformation @xmath as
done to obtain the new time-independent Hamiltonian @xmath in Eq. ( 37
), in an inconsistently way we are implementing a change of frame in
Schrödinger’s equation. Thus, it makes sense to consider the notion of
reference frame changes in quantum mechanics and it was done in 1997 by
W. H. Klink [ 82 ] . Here, we will present how the adiabatic parameters
discussed in previous sections depend on the frame representation used
to describe adiabaticity.

To study the description of the quantum mechanics in different reference
frame, let us rewrite the Schrödinger’s equation from the Von-Neumann
form as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (54)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the density matrix and @xmath is the time-dependent
Hamiltonian which drives the system under laboratory frame. Now, let us
consider a second observer, say Bob, that describes the system dynamics
from a different frame. For such observer, the system state reads

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (55)
  -- -------- -- ------

for some unitary operator @xmath . Particularly, @xmath needs to be
unitary because @xmath should be a density matrix, so that it has the
same properties as @xmath . Therefore, by putting @xmath into Eq. ( 54 )
we get the dynamical equation in Bob’s frame as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (56)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the Hamiltonian in this new frame and reads

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (57)
  -- -------- -- ------

This means that, under viewpoint of Bob, the system is driven by
different fields. In general, notice that the term @xmath arises when we
consider a time-dependent transformation on the original equation. W. H.
Klink identified the quantity @xmath as a “fictitious potential” which
arises due to the frame change as provided by @xmath [ 82 ] . The term
“fictitious potential” is used here because the above equation has an
analog in classical mechanics, where we rewrite the Newton’s law of
motion in different reference frame.

#### 4.1 Adiabatic dynamics of a two-level system in an oscillating
field

In particular, the results previously discussed are valid for the case
considered in Ref. [ 52 ] ; namely, a spin- @xmath in a rotating
magnetic field. No discussion of how this result can be applied to other
systems (different Hamiltonians) is discussed. Now, we discuss how these
results are not valid for a system of a spin- @xmath in the presence of
an oscillating magnetic field. The following results will be used to
motivate the study of the adiabatic parameters from different reference
frames, where a mechanism to recover the validity of the AC’s arise as
an alternative approach [ 61 ] .

Thus, consider the following Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (58)
  -- -------- -- ------

that describes the dynamics of a two-level system interacting with an
external oscillating field. Here we are interested in a situation where
@xmath , since our main interest here is studying the resonance effects
on the adiabaticity behavior of the system. The Hamiltonian in Eq. ( 58
) exhibits a resonance situation when we set the external field in a
configuration so that @xmath (see Appendix B ). In terms of the
dimensionless parameter @xmath ( @xmath ) the resonance condition
becomes @xmath .

#### 4.2 Experimental verification in a trapped ion system and
adiabaticity conditions

In order to study the resonance phenomena of a two level system driven
by the oscillating field which characterizes the Hamiltonian in Eq. ( 58
), it was used a trapped ion setup where the hyperfine energy level of
the Ytterbium ( @xmath Yb @xmath ) trapped ion in a six-needles Paul
trap was used as a two-level system [ 83 ] . Since the focus of this
thesis is not to provide an experimental description of the system used
in our experiment, the reader who wishes to get more details on the
experimental setup could read the Appendix D and/or Ref. [ 83 ] .

As discussed in Appendix D.1 , our qubit is encoded in a hyperfine
energy levels of the ground state @xmath as shown in Fig. 2 a . The
ground state @xmath is constituted of two orbitals with different values
of the total momentum angular @xmath denoted by @xmath and @xmath . In
particular, the state @xmath can be decomposed in three degenerate
states (at zero external field) @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . When we
introduce an external magnetic field, due the Zeeman effect, these three
states become non-degenerate (degeneracy break) with a frequency shift
@xmath (first order Zeeman shift), as shown in Fig. 2 b . Thus, the
qubit can be encoded on these states as @xmath and @xmath , whose
transition frequency is given by @xmath . Transitions between these
states is achieved by introducing a high controllable resonant microwave
with adjustable Rabi frequency @xmath and oscillation frequency @xmath .

As shown in Appendix D.2 , the parameters of the Hamiltonian in Eq. ( 58
) can be efficiently implemented using a single microwave with suitable
choices for oscillation and Rabi frequencies. In particular, the
component @xmath of the Hamiltonian can be implemented by a detuning
given by @xmath , while the second component @xmath is controlled by a
time-dependent Rabi frequency given by @xmath , which can be suitably
adjusted from a field with time-dependent intensity. By starting from
the initial state @xmath , in Fig. 3 we show the fidelity for the ground
state for different choices of the parameter @xmath . The fidelity here
is defined as

  -- -- -- ------
           (59)
  -- -- -- ------

where @xmath is the solution of the Schrödinger equation and @xmath is
the adiabatic solution. To compute the experimental values for fidelity
we do state tomography as discussed in Appendix D.3 . As theoretically
predict in Appendix B , when @xmath we can see transitions between the
energy levels of the system, where the minimum fidelity becomes @xmath
for @xmath s, then adiabaticity is broken when @xmath . Otherwise, for
sufficiently small or large values of @xmath , adiabaticity is observed
for all of evolution time.

Now, to compute the AC’s for the Hamiltonian in Eq. ( 58 ), we write the
set of eigenvectors of @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (60)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath , with @xmath and @xmath . The energies are

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (61)
  -- -------- -- ------

Thus, we compute the AC’s as provided by Eqs. ( 33 ), ( 46 ), ( 49 )
and ( 52 ) and the result is presented in Fig. 4 . From all of curves in
Fig. 4 , we set the value of the total evolution time given by
experimental one shown in Fig. 3 and the maximization in each equation
is obtained in interval @xmath , so it does not matter the
multiplicative value of @xmath for the conditions @xmath and @xmath
because we are computing the maximum value for all @xmath . In fact, any
value of @xmath and @xmath in some sub-interval of @xmath will provides
a same qualitative behavior shown in Fig. 4 . As result, the AC’s tell
us that adiabaticity is observed for values of @xmath , while such
adiabatic behavior is less probable as @xmath becomes sufficiently big.
In particular, it is important to note the case @xmath in comparative
with the case @xmath . In conclusion, based on Figs. 4 and 3 , as we can
see, all of the conditions considered here do not allow us to get a
correct description of the adiabatic behavior of the system. In summary,
we can say that it allows us to conclude that all of AC’s are neither
sufficient , because the validity is violated when we compare @xmath
with the results for @xmath , nor necessary when we consider the case
@xmath with that one for @xmath .

#### 4.3 Adiabatic parameters in non-inertial frames

A widely used procedure to deal with inconsistencies in the adiabatic
parameters is providing a new parameter able to solve the problem
previously obtained. We discussed a bit about that in Sec. 3 , where we
showed four different adiabatic parameters. However, here we will follow
a different approach to deal with the result shown in previous section.

It is evident the role of resonance in adiabaticity breaking of quantum
system. By taking into account that the resonance is a non-linear
phenomena (because small fields can drastically affect the system
dynamics) and that it is convenient to consider such phenomena through a
non-inertial frame change, here we will consider the adiabaticity
conditions as provided from the non-inertial viewpoint. In other words,
given the dynamics in the non-inertial frame we want to compute the
adiabatic parameters from this new frame. To introduce the non-inertial
frame, we use the unitary time-dependent operator @xmath and from Eq. (
56 ) the dynamics in the non-inertial frame is given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (62)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath and @xmath . After some calculation, it is possible to show
that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (63)
  -- -------- -- ------

with @xmath and @xmath . The spectrum of the Hamiltonian in the rotating
frame is therefore

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (64)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath , with

  -- -- -- ------
           (65)
  -- -- -- ------

and the set of eigenvalues are

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (66)
  -- -------- -- ------

A first point to be highlighted here is the influence of @xmath in the
spectrum of the non-inertial Hamiltonian. Therefore, by computing the
adiabatic parameters in this new frame the result is given as in Fig. 5
.

Thus, it is possible to see that AC’s when computed from the
non-inertial frame of the system allows ut to get a description
consistent with experimental the results in Fig. 3 . In order to give
some physical meaning to this result, let us consider the energy gap
between ground and excited state given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (67)
  -- -------- -- ------

so from Eq. ( 66 ) we can write the minimum gap as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (68)
  -- -------- -- ------

where we already used @xmath . Now, we can see that the peak in Fig. 5
is due to the minimum gap going to zero at resonance @xmath , at the
same time that the gap becomes sufficiently large when @xmath and it is
of order of @xmath when @xmath .

As a result, it is possible to see that the AC’s allow us to perfectly
describe the adiabatic behavior (or its breaking) of the system
considered here when computed in a different reference frame. This
suggests a frame-dependence of the adiabatic validity conditions in
guaranteeing the adiabatic approximation, as we pictorially describe in
Fig. 6 . It is important to highlight that even the traditional
adiabatic condition becomes sufficient and necessary in this new frame.
Thus, the immediate question to be addressed in next section is: Is this
frame change applicable to any quantum system?

### 5 Validation of quantum adiabaticity through non-inertial frames

As previously mentioned, here we are interested in providing a different
approach to deal with inconsistencies of the AC’s, so we are not
providing a new AC. The results present in the two previous sections are
valid for the particular Hamiltonian in Eq. ( 58 ), so the question we
have is: Is the frame change a universal strategy to validate the AC’s?

In order to extend the previous study to a large (or infinite) class of
Hamiltonians, let us consider the following Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (69)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the contributions @xmath and @xmath depend on the longitudinal and
transverse fields @xmath and @xmath , respectively, this means we can
write @xmath . Here we are denoting the fields by @xmath , but it does
not necessarily denote a magnetic field. We are considering that @xmath
is the natural frequency of the Hamiltonian @xmath , so note that the
frequency transition between energy levels of the system is a multiple
of @xmath and it depends on the set of eigenvalues for @xmath . Here we
are interested in a non-linear phenomenon that arises from the resonance
configuration of the system, so a second assumption is related with the
Hamiltonian @xmath and it reads as @xmath , physically it means we have
very small transverse fields acting on the system, the ideal scenario to
study these non-linear phenomena. Under the number of above
considerations, it is important to identify the dynamics given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (70)
  -- -------- -- ------

as a dynamics obtained from a inertial frame (for example, from
laboratory frame). However, it is possible to define a non-inertial
frame associated with the operator @xmath . In this new frame, the
dynamics is governed by the Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (71)
  -- -------- -- ------

and the equation for the system dynamics is given by the Eq. ( 62 ).
Note that in above Hamiltonian we have a contribution due to the frame
change, in same way that fictitious forces arise in classical mechanics
when we do a frame change from inertial to non-inertial ones. Thus, the
above equation can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (72)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath . Therefore, due to the quantity @xmath in the first term
of @xmath , which comes from contribution of the term @xmath to the term
@xmath , in this new frame it becomes evident that the contribution of
@xmath cannot be ignored in this new frame. From this new frame is
possible to see that the term @xmath promotes transitions in energy
levels of the system when @xmath , so the dynamics as provided by Eq. (
62 ) represents a dynamics under system reference. In this way, we can
clearly see that the adiabatic behavior in inertial frame becomes
impossible because we will get transitions between energy levels of the
Hamiltonian. In fact, once we are in a regime where @xmath , the
instantaneous time-dependent eigenvectors of @xmath are approximately
equal to the eigenvectors of @xmath . Moreover, note that we did not
anything about adiabaticity in non-inertial frame, so we could have some
adiabaticity in this new frame. However, as previously shown, there are
situations in which the ACs computed in non-inertial frame allow us to
get some general result on adiabaticity in inertial frame. This suggests
a connection between adiabaticity in different frames. To deal with this
question, we have the following theorem (see proof in Appendix C ).

###### Theorem \thechapter.1.

Consider a Hamiltonian @xmath and its non-inertial counterpart @xmath ,
with @xmath an arbitrary unitary transformation. The eigenstates of
@xmath and @xmath are denoted by @xmath and @xmath , respectively. Then,
if a quantum system @xmath is prepared at time @xmath in a particular
eigenstate @xmath of @xmath , then the adiabatic evolution of @xmath in
the inertial frame, governed by @xmath , implies in the adiabatic
evolution of @xmath in the non-inertial frame, governed by @xmath , if
and only if

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (73)
  -- -------- -- ------

@xmath @xmath , where @xmath , with @xmath denoting the total time of
evolution. Conversely, if the adiabatic dynamics in the non-inertial
frame starts in @xmath , then the dynamics in the inertial frame is also
adiabatic if and only if Eq. ( 73 ) is satisfied.

If the hypothesis of the above theorem is satisfied, then adiabaticity
in inertial frame can be used as witness of an adiabatic behavior in
non-inertial frame, so that no calculation of the AC’s in the changed
frame is required. Furthermore, we can use the Theorem \thechapter .1 to
predict the adiabaticity broken in inertial frame from the non-adiabatic
behavior in non-inertial frame. In fact, from the Morgan’s law, if
@xmath and @xmath then @xmath ( @xmath ), therefore if not @xmath then
not @xmath or not @xmath ( @xmath ) [ 84 , 85 ] . In this case, the
instance @xmath is the Theorem \thechapter .1 , @xmath is adiabaticity
in inertial frame and @xmath the adiabatic behavior in non-inertial
frame. Thus, not @xmath means non-adiabatic behavior in non-inertial
frame, since the instance @xmath remains valid (the hypothesis of the
theorem is satisfied) then we get not @xmath , that is, non-adiabatic
dynamics in inertial frame. The opposite is also true, if Eq. ( 73 ) is
satisfied we can associated adiabaticity in non-inertial frame with the
adiabatic dynamics in inertial frame and, by using the Morgan’s law,
non-adiabatic behavior in inertial frame implies non-adiabaticity in
non-inertial frame.

From this general study, the dynamics presented in Fig. 3 can be
correctly explained from curves in Fig. 5 by using the Theorem
\thechapter .1 , because for situations where we are at resonance and
far-from resonance the Theorem \thechapter .1 is satisfied. For a
detailed discussion, see Appendix C.1 .

#### 5.1 Revising the adiabatic dynamics of a spin

Now let us revisit the problem of the adiabatic dynamics of a spin-
@xmath in presence of a rotating magnetic field, as discussed in Sec. 3
. As a direct consequence of the time-independent Hamiltonian obtained
in non-inertial frame, as provided by the Eq. ( 37 ), the dynamics is
always (trivially) adiabatic. However, the Theorem \thechapter .1 is not
applicable to this system because the hypothesis of such theorem is not
obeyed here, since near to resonance the initial state in this case is
not an individual eigenstate of @xmath . In fact, the initial state in
non-inertial frame is prepared in an eigenstate of @xmath , but at
resonance we have @xmath . For this reason, we need to derive a new
strategy to deal with this case. Thus, by considering the situations in
which the Hamiltonian in inertial frame is time-independent, we derive
the following theorem (the proof is shown in Appendix C ).

###### Theorem \thechapter.2.

Consider a Hamiltonian @xmath and its non-inertial counterpart @xmath ,
with @xmath an arbitrary unitary transformation and @xmath a constant
Hamiltonian. The eigenstates of @xmath and @xmath are denoted by @xmath
and @xmath , respectively. Then, if a quantum system @xmath is prepared
at time @xmath in a particular eigenstate @xmath of @xmath , then the
adiabatic evolution of @xmath in the inertial frame, governed by @xmath
, occurs if and only if

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (74)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath , with @xmath denoting the total time of evolution, and
@xmath .

The experimental results in Ref. [ 52 ] can be validated by Theorem
\thechapter .2 , since the Hamiltonian in Eqs. ( 34 ) and ( 37 ) satisfy
the Eq. ( 74 ) in a far-from resonance situation and violates it at
resonance. In fact, the initial state @xmath can be approximately
written as @xmath [with @xmath ]. Thus, Eq. ( 74 ) provides the
condition @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . In a far-from-resonance
situation, we have @xmath , and we conclude that @xmath . This shows
that the dynamics in the inertial frame is (approximately) adiabatic far
from resonance. On the other hand, near to resonance, we get @xmath ,
where we can immediately conclude that @xmath is not valid for any
@xmath .

### 6 Stable quantum batteries through adiabatic dynamics

Batteries are devices able to store energy to be transferred to a
consumption hub at later times. In this sense, if we use quantum
mechanical effects to provide more efficient batteries concerning the
power during charging/discharging processes and available/extractable
energy, it emerges the possibility to design quantum devices known as
quantum batteries (QBs) [ 86 , 87 , 88 , 89 , 90 ] . QBs are potentially
relevant as fuel for other quantum devices and, more generally, for
boosting a proper development of quantum networks. In particular, they
have been proposed in a number of distinct experimental architectures,
such as spin systems [ 91 ] , quantum cavities [ 92 , 93 , 94 , 89 ] ,
superconducting transmon qubits [ 62 ] , and quantum oscillators [ 95 ,
96 ] . Among fundamental challenges for useful QBs are both the control
of the energy transfer and the stability of the discharge process to an
available consumption hub (CH) (see, e.g., Refs. [ 62 , 97 , 98 ] for
recent discussion about the stability topic). In this section we will
consider the application of adiabatic dynamics to design stable quantum
batteries [ 63 ] . In addition, it is presented a power switchable
scheme of quantum batteries based on a power operator that describes the
instantaneous energy transfer rate from battery to a consumption hub.

#### 6.1 Stable charging process in three-level quantum batteries

Given a quantum system and its internal Hamiltonian @xmath , which sets
the system energy scale, we define the energy of the system as @xmath ,
where @xmath is the matrix density of the system. Here we define the
energy system in terms of the population of @xmath concern the
eigenstates of @xmath , where any control Hamiltonian @xmath does not
contribute to the quantity @xmath . Then, we can define the system
energy when we set the reference Hamiltonian @xmath . Thus, if we drive
the system using the Hamiltonian @xmath , the energy of the system
changes in according with

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (75)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the evolution operator. Despite the energy to be
computed from above equation, in context of quantum batteries it does
not mean the available energy in system is given by @xmath ; The
available energy is obtained from notion of ergotropy @xmath [ 99 ] .
The ergotropy is the maximum amount of work that can be extracted from a
quantum battery and reads as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (76)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the passive state , defined as a state in which no
energy can be extracted from the system by unitary transformations
@xmath defined on the set @xmath of all unitary operations on the
Hilbert space @xmath of the system. Mathematically we write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (77)
  -- -------- -- ------

In this thesis, since we are interested in unitary dynamics that leads
the system from empty charge battery state to the full charge state, the
passive state is identified as the ground state @xmath of @xmath . Then,
to define our three-level quantum battery, let us consider a
non-degenerate quantum battery as a @xmath -level quantum system
described by the Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (78)
  -- -------- -- ------

with @xmath . The battery is said to be in a passive state if no energy
can be extracted from it through some cyclic process, e.g. the turning
on of some potential @xmath , for a time @xmath , that satisfies the
boundary conditions @xmath . Interestingly, an array of such batteries
may not be passive with some work being available, but requiring some
collective processing of the batteries [ 92 , 88 , 91 , 89 ] . A notable
exception to this is the thermal states which are said to be completely
passive as even with such collective processing one cannot extract any
work [ 100 ] . Active states are those that allowed for work to be
extracted through some cyclic process, with maximal amount of
extractable work is called the ergotropy [ 99 ] . We remark that @xmath
is a special case where all passive states are completely passive as any
diagonal state in the energy eigenbasis is necessarily a thermal state
at some temperature. In what follows we will be concerned with stable
charging of a single three-level quantum battery, @xmath .

We will be interested in examining the energy stored in a quantum
battery through some, possibly non-unitary, process. The system energy
at time @xmath is simply @xmath and if we assume our battery begins in
the ground state, @xmath , the ergotropy is the difference in energy
between the final and initial battery states after the charging process
is over,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (79)
  -- -------- -- ------

with the maximum stored energy @xmath achievable via a process which
transfers all the population from the initial ground state to the
maximally excited state. In this particular study, we consider a
charging process done through Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage
(STIRAP) [ 15 ] , where we can ensure a stable adiabatic quantum battery
(as we shall see). It is possible to generalize the proposed setting to
systems with @xmath using chain STIRAP processes that connect the lowest
lying energy eigenstate to the highest one [ 15 ] . Therefore, we assume
that system to be driven by the time-dependent Hamiltonian [ 15 , 101 ,
102 , 103 ]

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (80)
  -- -------- -- ------

In this case, the complete Hamiltonian which describes the dynamics of
the system can be written as @xmath . The Hamiltonian @xmath develops
the role of a quantum charger for our three-level quantum battery as we
need to couple our system to the external fields described by @xmath in
order to charge the battery. While the bare Hamiltonian is important for
dictating the amount of energy stored in the battery, the dynamics is
driven by the interaction Hamiltonian @xmath . In fact, by considering
the dynamics of the system in a general time-dependent interaction
picture, the new Hamiltonian can be written as [ 104 ]

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (81)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath and

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (82)
  -- -------- -- ------

where we already assumed that both fields in Eq. ( 80 ) are on resonance
with the energy levels of the battery. Thus, it is possible to show
that, in this new representation, we can get the population in each
energy level from @xmath , where @xmath is the projector @xmath . In
addition, @xmath , so that @xmath can be obtained from the dynamics in
the rotating frame. As already discussed in Sec. 4 , it is important to
highlight that the adiabatic behavior in this frame does not mean
adiabaticity in the inertial frame, for this reason we can deal with an
adiabatic charging process of quantum batteries. Therefore, the system
dynamics as in the above equation can be considered in our study without
loss of generality, so that the study of the charging procedure of our
battery through an adiabatic dynamics will be done in this new frame. By
computing the set of eigenvectors of the new Hamiltonian @xmath we find

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
                          
     @xmath               (83a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (83b)
     @xmath               (83c)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

associated with eigenvalues @xmath and @xmath , where @xmath . Then, as
mentioned, we will assume the process starts with the battery state
@xmath . This state can be written as a combination of different
elements of Eqs. ( 83 ), depending on the initial values of the
parameters @xmath and @xmath . Therefore we can choose different
charging protocols associated with distinct choices of the parameters
@xmath and @xmath , by adjusting how the external fields act on the
system at the start of the evolution. We will show that while some
protocols will lead to an unstable charged state, and therefore would
require a carefully timed decoupling of the battery from the charging
fields, by exploiting the STIRAP technique, we can achieve a stable and
robust charged state.

Unstable charging – From Eqs. ( 83 ), it is possible to show that the
initial state @xmath can be written as a combination of the states
@xmath and @xmath if we set @xmath and @xmath . In fact, by considering
this initial values for @xmath and @xmath , one can show that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (84)
  -- -------- -- ------

In case where we admit that the system undergoes an adiabatic dynamics,
we find the evolved state [ 21 , 1 , 3 , 19 ]

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (85)
  -- -------- -- ------

where we already used the parallel transport condition @xmath , for all
@xmath . Thus, we write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (86)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath . Therefore, one finds the ergotropy @xmath as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (87)
  -- -------- -- ------

From the above equation, one makes evident that to achieve maximal
ergotropy firstly we must fix the final values for the parameters @xmath
and @xmath at some cutoff time (or charging time) @xmath in order to get
@xmath and @xmath . This involves particular initial and final
conditions on the parameters @xmath and @xmath to fully charge the
battery. Secondly, the instant in which the system achieves the full
charge is when @xmath . Under these constraints, we achieve maximum
ergotropy, @xmath . However, from Eq. ( 87 ) one can see that for @xmath
the battery charge cannot be kept at its maximum value, and rather it
will continue to oscillate between fully charged and fully dissipated
states due to the action of the fields. We describe a protocol which
leads to this situation as an unstable battery charging process. In
addition, the function @xmath depends on the integration from @xmath to
some instant @xmath , the sine and cosine functions could become highly
oscillating, such that that after @xmath we can have many maximum and
minimum values for the ergotropy. We understand this as follows: in an
adiabatic regime of the charging process, there is an intrinsic
discharging process due to the relative quantal phases in Eq. ( 85 ).
The adiabatic phase associated with different adiabatic paths
(eigenstates), promote destructive and constructive superpositions of
the components @xmath of the states @xmath and @xmath . Consequently, we
observe the natural discharging as a process due to destructive
interference from @xmath . Thus, a charging strategy that begins the
adiabatic evolution with @xmath and @xmath does not lead to a stable and
robust quantum battery. We remark that the above result is not a
particular feature of adiabatic charging process. Actually, this
spontaneous discharging is an intrinsic characteristic of different
systems where the oscillatory behavior of the quantal phases promotes
some (partial) destructive interference as obtained in Eq. ( 87 ).

Stable charging via STIRAP – An alternative strategy for our quantum
battery is through the eigenstate @xmath , the so-called dark state [
102 ] . Again, the system initial state needs to be @xmath , then from
Eqs. ( 83 ) we can see that to follow the dark state path we need to set
the initial values of the parameters @xmath and @xmath . Thus,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (88)
  -- -------- -- ------

By letting the system undergo adiabatic dynamics, the evolved state
becomes

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (89)
  -- -------- -- ------

with no quantal phase accompanying the evolution, because the adiabatic
phase is null, once we have @xmath and @xmath . The ergotropy is then

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (90)
  -- -------- -- ------

which achieves its maximum value when @xmath and @xmath , without any
assumption about the value of @xmath , in stark contrast to the unstable
charging process. Clearly to get a fully charged battery both initial
and final conditions on the parameters @xmath and @xmath are required.
However, by exploiting the STIRAP protocol we can avoid the oscillatory
behavior otherwise present due to accumulated quantal phases.

A second important physical lesson of these results is associated with
the intrinsic characteristics of dark states. Unlike the other
eigenstates of the Hamiltonian driving the system, the dark state does
not allow population inversion even when we put the fields on resonance
with the system. In fact, from the evolved state given in Eq. ( 89 ) we
can see that any change in @xmath just depends on the changes in
parameters @xmath and @xmath associated with intensity of the fields
used to drive the system. This property allows us to design a robust
battery that does not suffer from spontaneous discharging if the control
fields are not switched off after the charging process. Thus, the
emergence of the dark state further highlights the relevance of
three-level (or @xmath -level) systems over the more commonly considered
two-level qubits in designing stable quantum batteries [ 105 ] .

##### Three-level superconducting transmon quantum batteries

In previous section we showed as the stability problem of quantum
batteries can be suitably solved with a three-level quantum system,
where a spontaneous discharging (dashed red curve in Fig. 7 a ) arises
due to coherent oscillations of the system [ 95 , 89 , 91 , 96 , 94 ] .
In fact, in classical batteries we have an stable charging process, in
sense that after a “charge time” @xmath the charge in battery becomes
constant in time (blue continuum curve in Fig. 7 a ). Therefore, such a
behavior is highly wished for developing robust (stable) quantum
batteries. In particular, the three-level battery introduced here can be
implemented in several physical systems in which we can encode a ladder
three-level systems, as sketched in Fig. 7 b shown like trapped ion
systems and superconducting circuit QED system [ 106 , 107 , 108 ] , for
example. Here we propose that superconducting transmon qubits are
particularly suitable candidates [ 109 , 110 , 111 , 112 ] , the
ladder-type three-level system is schematically presented in Fig. 7 c .
These qubits are fabricated (typically planar) chips and consist of two
Josephson junctions, with capacitance @xmath and energy @xmath , that
are shunted by a large capacitor with capacitance @xmath . While the
quantized circuit corresponding to a standard @xmath circuit
(capacitance-inductance) will result in a harmonic oscillator, the
Josephson junction functions as a non-linear inductor and distorts the
spectrum of the oscillator away from the equally-spaced one. The great
success of the transmon qubit derives from its large ratio of Josephson
to capacitative energy @xmath , where @xmath with @xmath . As discussed
by Koch et al. [ 109 ] , a large @xmath renders the system very
insensitive to charge noise, hence enhancing the lifetime. There is a
catch however: the anisotropy in the spectrum also scales with @xmath
and goes down with increasing ratio. Recall that the anisotropy needs to
be significant to ensure that we are away from the equally-spaced case
and can address individual levels to produce well-defined qubits.
Fortunately, the anisotropy scales as a power law, while the noise
sensitivity depends exponentially on this ratio. Hence, one may find a
“sweet spot” with good anisotropy and long lifetimes. In practice, one
typically aims for @xmath [ 109 ] . Typical energy level splittings in
transmon qubits are of the order of 10 GHz, while the anisotropies are
of the order of 100 MHz, and while this is much smaller than the
splitting, modern microwave techniques are more than adequate to address
such levels [ 108 ] .

The previous results have focused on an idealized setting where our
quantum battery does not suffer any environmentally induced spoiling
effects. However, because we want to propose a realistic implementation
of our device, we need to deal with the performance and stability of our
quantum battery when the most relevant environmental effects are taken
into consideration (see Refs. [ 113 , 15 ] for other studies exploring
decoherence effects on STIRAP protocols). In particular we will consider
a dynamics governed by a Lindblad master equation [ 24 ] which takes
into account both relaxation and dephasing phenomena, corresponding to
the most natural non-unitary effects in superconducting circuits [ 114 ,
115 , 116 ] , which we propose as a natural platform to realize our
battery. The dynamics of the system is then given by the open-system
dynamics equation

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (91)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the superoperators @xmath and @xmath describe the relaxation and
dephasing phenomena, respectively, and can be written as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (92a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (92b)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath . Building on the general definitions we have
introduced in Eqs. ( 92 ), we would like to clarify two important points
on the characteristics of noise we consider in the rest of this work.
First, the relaxation processes we consider are only the sequential
decays, meaning, @xmath and @xmath characterized by the rates @xmath and
@xmath , respectively. We do not take into account the nonsequential
decay mechanism which is responsible from inducing transitions like
@xmath , since the rate associated with such a process, @xmath , is an
order of magnitude smaller for transmon qubits [ 117 ] and, as we shall
discuss later, one can take it as a negligible parameter in our
discussion. Second, @xmath and @xmath determine the rates at which the
superpositions between @xmath and @xmath , and @xmath and @xmath are
suppressed, respectively. Together, they also contribute to the
dephasing of superpositions between @xmath and @xmath . However, due to
the nature of the STIRAP protocol with the dark state, the only
dephasing rate that has an impact on the charging protocol is @xmath ,
since the state @xmath is never populated during the process. Clearly,
there are a number of timescales and relevant noise parameters to fix in
order to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of our protocol. In
what follows, we will focus on those parameter ranges most relevant for
transmon qubits, which provide a promising candidate architecture.
Nevertheless, we expect the qualitative behavior discussed to hold in
other relevant settings.

Stable charging under dissipation and decoherence – As a first important
question, we examine the effect that environmental spoiling mechanisms
have on the charging process itself. To this end we consider @xmath and
@xmath , where @xmath is a function which satisfies @xmath and @xmath ,
such that the boundary conditions on @xmath and @xmath are satisfied and
we realise the stable charging via STIRAP. We can readily examine the
behavior of the ergotropy as a function of the dimensionless parameter
@xmath . In addition to the ergotropy, equally important is assessing
the charging power of quantum batteries [ 118 ] , which we define as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (93)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath needs to be understood as the amount of energy transferred
to the battery from external fields during the time interval @xmath . In
order to make a meaningful comparison, we rescale @xmath with the
maximal attainable power @xmath . As argued by Binder et al , it is
physically reasonable to bound the amount of energy available for a
given charging protocol [ 92 ] . The most efficient charging process
therefore corresponds to one which needs only enough energy to fully
charge the battery, in our case @xmath . We can then exploit the quantum
speed limit [ 119 ] to determine the minimum time, @xmath , needed for
some time-independent process to charge the battery and thus corresponds
to the most powerful charging obtainable, under this energy constraint [
92 ] . Thus, @xmath . We fix the functional form of @xmath to be a
simple linear ramp, @xmath . Naturally, one could consider any other
ramp that satisfies the boundary conditions, however, as STIRAP is an
adiabatic protocol, the means by which one manipulates the system is of
little consequence. While from one ramp to another some qualitative
differences may emerge in the behavior as one approaches the adiabatic
regime, the quantitative features outlined in what follows persist.

Therefore, by letting the system evolves under Eq. ( 91 ), the
instantaneous charge and charging power are shown in Fig. 8 . The Fig. 8
a shows the instantaneous charge (ergotropy) as funtion of the parameter
@xmath for different values of the decohering parameters which we
specify in details in the caption of the figure. Such parameters are
considered in line with the transmon implementation we propose here. The
asymptotic curve close to @xmath corresponds to the free-decohering
situation. As already discussed in previous section, the stabilizing
performance of three-level batteries adiabatically driven provide a very
stable charging process. One can see that fast evolution gives a
vanishingly small ergotropy as these timescales are far from the
adiabatic limit, therefore the STIRAP protocol is ineffective and no
population inversion can be observed. As we increase @xmath , in line
with the adiabatic theorem [ 25 , 19 ] , the maximum ergotropy grows and
we achieve a fully charged state when the STIRAP protocol is faithfully
implemented. We clearly see that in the case of no decoherence the
charged state is perfectly stable for @xmath . Conversely, the ergotropy
is affected when the decoherence effects become more significant. For
small values of decoherence (blue, dashed curve) the STIRAP protocol is
quite robust and only becomes significantly adversely affected when the
times scales are an order of magnitude slower than strictly necessary.
As the environmental effects are increased we find that achieving a
fully charged battery is not possible, however, we can identify a range
of values for @xmath for which we get the optimal stored charge, as we
can see in the black, dotted curve in Fig. 8 a . Thus, a given @xmath
sets the speed of the adiabatic evolution and we can see that an
optimality criterion between total evolution time and decoherence
effects appears.

The power is shown in Fig. 8 b , where we rescaled it using the maximum
power value @xmath , which is only weakly affected for reasonable
environmental parameters. Naturally, for fast protocols where the
battery fails to charge the resulting power is negligible. As @xmath
increases the charging power also increases until it reaches a maximum
of @xmath . We are considering the optimal power @xmath as provided by
the quantum speed limit, then it is natural to see the discrepancy
between @xmath and the maximum power for an unitary dynamics. However,
it is interesting to note that the maximum power does not correspond to
when the battery is fully charged. By comparing Figs. 8 a and 8 b we see
that, for all the considered noise values, the maximum ergotropy is
achieved for @xmath , which corresponds to @xmath . Thus we find that
there is a trade-off between the maximum achievable ergotropy and the
power when stably charging a quantum battery via STIRAP. A promising
method to boost the power of our protocol would be to employ so-called
shortcuts-to-adiabaticity [ 39 , 40 ] . However, these techniques
invariably come at the cost of some additional resources which will
affect the resulting efficiency and power, but nevertheless may prove
useful to ensure both fast and stable quantum batteries.

As already mentioned, it is important to stress that the results shown
in Fig. 8 do not take into account decay transitions between @xmath .
This assumption is justified since, in case where no noise mechanism
acts on our system, the adiabatic behavior is achieved for @xmath .
Notice that the highest decay rate we consider is @xmath , which allows
us to write @xmath or @xmath . Replacing the parameters with their
values in the adiabatic limit we find @xmath . Thus, @xmath is indeed
relevant to our discussion. As experimentally shown [ 117 ] , the
timescale @xmath for the process @xmath is @xmath , where @xmath is the
timescale of the process @xmath . Therefore we can write @xmath . From
this we have that @xmath , which allows us to conclude that the
relaxation due to non-sequential rates, i.e. @xmath , are negligible for
the adiabatic time scales considered in this work.

#### 6.2 Stable and power switchable two-level quantum batteries

In previous section we show how the stability of quantum batteries can
be obtained by introducing a three-level quantum battery driven by
adiabatic fields. There is not doubt that the additional energy level is
very helpful for the results, since we drive the system through a
dark-state, but here we will investigate the role of the adiabatic
dynamics in a general context of quantum batteries. To this end, we
introduce here the notion of power operator, a new quantum observable
that develops a important role in theory of quantum batteries, as we
shall see.

##### The power operator

The derivation of the power operator takes into account the following
physical model. Consider a composite quantum system described by a
Hilbert space @xmath , where @xmath is associated with a QB and @xmath
refers to an auxiliary system, which will play the role of a CH. Our
choice is just a convenience, our results are suitably applicable to
cases where the Hilbert space @xmath is replaced by a quantum charger
and @xmath becomes a fully discharged quantum battery. Therefore, our
approach is useful for both charge and discharge process of quantum
batteries. However, here we will consider the discharging process. The
dynamics for the composite system is driven by the Hamiltonian @xmath ,
where @xmath is the individual energy contribution for both QB and CH
subsystems, while @xmath is the corresponding interaction Hamiltonian.
The Hamiltonian @xmath can be written as @xmath , with @xmath being the
battery inner Hamiltonian and @xmath the auxiliary free Hamiltonian. In
general, the inner parts of the QB may interact with each other, with
this inner interaction included in Hamiltonian @xmath .

As already discussed, the success of the energy transfer from the QB to
the CH can be measured by the ergotropy , i.e. the maximum amount of
work which can be further extracted from the CH. Then, here we identify
@xmath , where @xmath is the ground state of @xmath , because @xmath is
our system of interest. The contribution @xmath to the ergotropy is the
empty energy state, which is here given by @xmath . Hence, the ergotropy
of the CH reads @xmath , where @xmath is the CH initial state. Notice
that, by starting the evolution in the ground state of the CH, we have
@xmath . However, by coupling the QB to the CH, an energy transfer
process will take place, which will be governed by Schrödinger equation.
It will be useful here to adopt the interaction picture, where the
density operator @xmath is driven by @xmath , with the dot symbol
denoting time derivative throughout the paper. The amount of energy
@xmath available at instant @xmath is obtained from the instantaneous
ergotropy, reading

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (94)
  -- -------- -- ------

Eq. ( 94 ) provides the amount of energy transferred from the QB to the
CH, which can be further used as a source of work. Throughout our
discussion we are assuming that the CH final state is a pure state,
otherwise the above equation cannot be considered as ergotropy [ 63 ] .
Now, the starting point for the QB proposal is to consider the
instantaneous power, which is defined as @xmath . Notice that @xmath
quantifies the transfer rate at which energy is available at the CH.
Then, from definition of the power operator, we get

  -- -- -- ------
           (95)
  -- -- -- ------

where we used Schrödinger equation for @xmath . Thus, we find

  -- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (96)
  -- -------- -------- -- ------

where we used that @xmath . Then, by defining

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (97)
  -- -------- -- ------

we conclude that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (98)
  -- -------- -- ------

For convenience, we need to consider the system dynamics in interaction
picture so that the internal Hamiltonian @xmath does not contribute to
the dynamics and for the charging process (see e.g. the section 6.1 ).
Therefore, by considering Schrödinger equation in the interaction
picture, we have

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (99)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the dot symbol denotes time derivative, @xmath , and @xmath , with
@xmath . It is important to mention that the relevant quantities to be
computed here are independent of the frame used to study the dynamics.
In fact, by computing the ergotropy in the interaction picture, we get

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (100)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

By following the same calculation, in the interaction picture, we can
use the Eq. ( 99 ) to find that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (101)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the power in interaction picture, which reads @xmath .
It shows that no information is lost if we consider our analysis from
the interaction picture, then whenever it is convenient we will consider
our discussion from interaction picture.

In conclusion, it is possible to introduce a Hermitian operator able to
compute the expected value of the power, with the above equation showing
that the eigenvalues of @xmath provide the expected values of a
measurement of such physical quantity. As a first application of the
observable @xmath , we can show that the adiabatic dynamics allows for a
stable energy transfer to the CH . In fact, by defining that the system
QB-CH undergoes an adiabatic energy transfer process when the composite
state @xmath evolves adiabatically under the Hamiltonian @xmath that
drives the system. Let the system be initialized in the state @xmath ,
where @xmath is the set of instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath . Then,
in the adiabatic regime, we have @xmath , where @xmath are the adiabatic
phases accompanying the adiabatic dynamics [ 81 ] . Therefore

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (102)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath and where we have used @xmath . Thus, we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (103)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, let us consider the case where our system starts in a single
eigenstate of the Hamiltonian @xmath , for example the @xmath -th
eigenstate of @xmath . By doing that, we have @xmath and the above
equation becomes

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (104)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, since the stability condition for an interval @xmath can be
mathematically written as @xmath for any @xmath , this result allows us
to conclude that adiabatic dynamics is a strategy to get a stable
charging process in quantum batteries because @xmath , where @xmath is
the required time to achieve the adiabatic regime. The same calculation
as be done for the situation where we have a degenerate eigenspace of
the Hamiltonian, where get the same result.

As a second application of the observable @xmath , it is introduced a
general energy trapping mechanism [ 63 ] . To begin with, assume that
@xmath is a constant Hamiltonian, namely, @xmath , which implies that
@xmath is also a constant operator. Then, notice that, if @xmath and
@xmath commute, we have that @xmath is a constant of motion. Assume now
that there is a common eigenstate @xmath of @xmath and @xmath with power
eigenvalue @xmath . Therefore, by initially preparing the quantum system
at the quantum state @xmath , no amount of energy can be extracted from
the QB. In fact, let us consider the initial state of the system as
@xmath , where we have @xmath and @xmath . The evolved state reads
@xmath . Therefore, the instantaneous power is @xmath . Hence, no amount
of energy can be introduced or extracted from the system driven by
@xmath . Remarkably, this conclusion holds even if @xmath and @xmath
does not commute, as long as they share at least a single eigenstate
with power eigenvalue @xmath . This less restrictive situation is indeed
even more interesting and is it explored in Ref. [ 63 ] . Indeed, the
the trapping mechanism opens perspectives for a class of QBs in which
the energy is not transferred even when the battery is connected to the
CH.

As we shall see, we can also develop an activation mechanism, where we
can control the exact time to discharge the energy to the CH. In this
thesis we will focus on adiabatic performance of such devices and the
trapping mechanism will be considered in this framework. However in Ref.
[ 63 ] we study the trapping mechanism in terms of time-independent
fields, where a Bell quantum battery is proposed because we use Bell
states to achieve optimal performance of the battery.

##### Adiabatic model for stable QBs

As already introduced, phenomenon known as spontaneous discharge is not
desired, but in our case we can circumvents this problem if we eliminate
the energy oscillates between the QB and the CH after the QB starts its
energy distribution. In turn, there will be energy revivals in the QB
for specific times, which prevents a stable battery discharge. Here,
inspired by Eq. ( 103 ), we can provide a general approach to
stabilizing the charging processes of QBs. The control of the battery
discharge is again provided by a time-dependent Hamiltonian @xmath . It
is assumed that @xmath can be turned on and off with high control. As we
turn it on, it is also able to ensure stability in the discharge
process. As in the case of the Bell QB discussed in Ref. [ 63 ] , we
begin by taking the initial state of the whole system as @xmath . Then,
let us consider a suitable three-qubit time-dependent Hamiltonian, which
reads (in interaction picture)

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (105)
  -- -------- -- -------

Each part of the above Hamiltonian is important to the protocol. The
initial Hamiltonian @xmath sets the initial battery state @xmath as its
ground state, so that the desired state @xmath will be the system at the
end of the evolution if we choose the final Hamiltonian @xmath as @xmath
. To end, we need to guarantee that the system will flow an adiabatic
dynamics in interaction picture we introduce the middle Hamiltonian
@xmath , so that there are no level crossings for @xmath , which is
assured by the middle Hamiltonian @xmath . This allows for the quantum
evolution towards the target state through the adiabatic dynamics.

Before all, it is important to deal with the problem of the double
degenerate spectrum of the ground state of @xmath . Since both states
@xmath (desired state) and @xmath are eigenvectors of @xmath with same
eigenvalue, then it remains to prove that the final state @xmath is
achieved due to the symmetries of @xmath . Then, by defining the parity
operator @xmath , we can verify that @xmath for all @xmath . Therefore,
@xmath preserves the parity of the state throughout the evolution. Since
we start the evolution at the state @xmath , which has parity eigenvalue
@xmath , the system will evolve to subsequent states with the same
parity. Hence, transitions to @xmath at the end of the evolution are
forbidden, so that all the energy of the QB can be adiabatically
transferred to the CH, achieving the final state @xmath . Then, by
considering the CH system as a two-level system with internal
Hamiltonian @xmath , we illustrate in Fig. 9 the instantaneous charge
transferred to the CH. One shows that this transfer is indeed stable for
several different choices of the interpolation function @xmath . In
agreement with Eq. ( 103 ), the QB discharge process is stable and
robust against variations of the interpolation scheme.

### 7 Conclusions of this chapter

In this chapter we discussed the main results of this thesis concerning
adiabatic dynamics in closed system. As a first result [ 61 ] , we
studied a validation mechanism for the ACs already introduced in the
literature. From a particular example of a two-level system driven by a
time-dependent oscillating Hamiltonian, we showed that all the
conditions widely used in literature are neither sufficient nor
necessary in predicting the adiabatic dynamics of such evolution. Then,
we have introduced a framework to validate such ACs for generic discrete
multi-particle Hamitonians, which is rather convenient to analyze
quantum systems at resonance. Our strategy is based on the analysis of
ACs in a suitably designed non-inertial reference frame. By using this
new strategy, we have both theoretically and experimentally shown that
the relevant ACs considered here, which include the traditional AC, are
sufficient and necessary to describe the adiabatic behavior of the
system. In this case, sufficiency and necessity are fundamentally
obtained through the non-inertial frame map, with all the conditions
failing to point out the adiabatic behavior in the original reference
frame. The experimental realization has been performed through a single
trapped Ytterbium ion, with excellent agreement with the theoretical
results. More generally, the validation of ACs has been expanded to
arbitrary Hamiltonians through the Theorems \thechapter .1 and
\thechapter .2 , with detailed conditions provided for a large class of
Hamiltonians in the form of Eq. ( 69 ). Therefore, instead of looking
for new approaches for defining ACs, we have introduced a mechanism
based on “fictitious potentials” (associated with non-inertial frames)
to reveal a correct indication of ACs, both at resonance and of-resonant
situations. In addition, as a further example, we discussed how the
validation mechanism through non-inertial frames can be useful to
describe the results presented in Ref. [ 52 ] , where the adiabatic
dynamics of a single spin- @xmath in NMR had been previously
investigated.

As an application of these general results, in a second moment we
investigated the performance of adiabatic quantum batteries, where we
have shown how to adiabatically charge/discharge quantum batteries in
two different contexts. Firstly, we introduced a three-level quantum
battery able to be fully charged through a very stable (adiabatic)
trajectory. To this end, we employ STIRAP that allows one to bypass the
undesired spontaneous discharging due to imprecise control on the fields
that occur if the charging process couples directly only two levels of
the battery, e.g. the ground and maximally excited states. While
(effective) qubit batteries require careful manipulation of the charging
fields, our three-dimensional quantum battery is able to exploit the
STIRAP protocol to ensure a robust and stable charge. We explicitly
consider the effects of the most relevant sources of noise and have
shown that even for moderate values of decoherence and dissipation, our
adiabatic quantum battery is quite robust. For more severe environmental
effects we have shown that an optimal time emerges that dictates the
maximal achievable ergotropy. We finally proposed that superconducting
transmon qubits provide a promising implementation for adiabatic quantum
batteries. Our results show that clear advantages can be gained by
exploiting higher-dimensional quantum systems. As such we expect that
extending our analysis to consider arrays of high-dimensional quantum
batteries, and the role of entanglement in the collective charging
process, will be of significant interest [ 86 , 92 , 87 ] .

After, we discussed on general results of adiabatic charging/discharging
process of quantum batteries. Since two level system are more easy to
control in experimental setups, it is quite important to circumvent the
issue of stable charging of two-level systems. Then, we have proposed a
system constituted by a QB (charged) and a CH that will be receive the
amount of energy initially stored in battery. Of course, our system can
be easily adapted to the situation of a initially discharged QB coupled
to a charger. As main element of our study, we have introduced a new
observable associated with the power, where the power operator is the
source of two main applications: (i) a trapping energy mechanism based
on a common eigenstate between the power operator and the interaction
Hamiltonian, in which the battery can indefinitely retain its energy
even if it is coupled to the CH; (ii) an asymptotically stable discharge
mechanism, which is achieved through an adiabatic evolution leading to
vanishing power. Then, we can solve in general the stability of the
energy transfer process, with no backflow of energy from the CH to the
QB. More specifically, we introduced a piecewise time-dependent
Hamiltonian that stabilizes the energy discharging process through the
adiabatic dynamics. The scaling of this model of QB can be achieved by
adding Bell pairs to the QB, with each Bell pair providing a
controllable mechanism for full and stable charge of a qubit in the CH.
Experimental implementations may inherit hardware designs originally
proposed for adiabatic quantum computing, being available with current
technology.

In both protocols of QB introduced here, we showed that they allow for
the design of batteries that are robust to intrinsic errors in real
physical scenarios concerning unknown delays in turning off the charging
fields.

## Chapter \thechapter Adiabatic dynamics in open quantum systems
\lettrine

[lines=3,lhang=0.33,nindent=0em] W hen we consider the adiabatic theorem
as derived in the previous chapter, we take into account the absence of
non-unitary effects on our system, where the system follows a unitary
dynamics from some initial state to the final one. In cases we need to
deal with decohering effects, due to the coupling of our system with
some environment, the dynamical equation is drastically changed and the
notion of adiabaticity previously established is breakdown. For this
reason, we need to derive an alternative approach in that case. In this
section we review the main results about adiabaticity in open systems,
particularly we will following the most general approach as derived in
Ref. [ 25 ] . It is possible to find alternative studies on adiabatic
behavior in open systems [ 120 , 121 ] , but all of the them can be
viewed as a particular application of the most general study in Ref. [
25 ] . The results presented in this chapter refer to the following

### 8 Adiabatic approximation in open systems

As discussed in section 2 , the non-diagonalizable characteristic of the
superoperator @xmath needs to be taken into account before defining
adiabaticity in a non-unitary evolution. In this thesis we will consider
the general definition of adiabaticity as established in Ref. [ 25 ] .

###### Definition \thechapter.1 (Adiabaticity in open systems).

An open quantum system is said to undergo an adiabatic dynamics if the
evolution of its Hilbert-Schmidt space can be decomposed into uncoupled
Lindblad-Jordan eigenspaces associated with distinct, time-dependent,
non-crossing eigenvalues of @xmath .

By Lindblad-Jordan eigenspaces we mean a set of vectors composed by the
eigenvectors of a single Jordan block of the Lindblad superoperator.
Therefore, the independent dynamics of a Jordan block of @xmath is
analogous to the independent dynamics of a degenerated eigenspace of the
Hamiltonian through an adiabatic dynamics in closed system. However, it
is important to highlight this discussion as an analogy. In cases where
@xmath admits uni-dimensional Jordan blocks, which means that @xmath is
diagonalizable, the adiabatic dynamics in open system is not the same as
adiabatic dynamics in closed system, since the set of eigenvectors of
@xmath does not characterize the spectrum of the Hamiltonian that drives
the system. In addition, as we shall see, some eigenvectors of @xmath
does not represent realistic physical states of a system, unlike the set
of eigenvectors of the system Hamiltonian.

Thus, the immediate question is: under what conditions can we achieve
the adiabatic behavior in open systems? To answer this question, our
starting point is writing the evolved state @xmath expanded in the basis
@xmath as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (106)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath are coefficients to be determined. By putting the above
equation in Eq. ( 21 ), we use the eigenvalue equations in Eqs. ( 30 )
to write

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (107)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

The two first terms in right-hand side of the above equation is
associated with the perfect uncoupled evolution, where we have
decoupling between different Jordan blocks and inside of each block. The
third and fourth terms tell us about the coupling between the @xmath -th
and all of other eigenvectors inside a single block. Therefore, in
according with the Definition \thechapter .1 , both cases could be
considered as genuine adiabatic dynamics in context of open systems.

#### 8.1 One-dimensional Jordan blocks

Before considering the most generalized case, let us restrict our first
analysis to the case in which the @xmath admits an Jordan decomposition
with one-dimensional Jordan blocks in Eq. ( 29 ). Under this assumption,
the quasi-eigenstate relations in Eqs. ( 30 ) become genuine eigenstate
equations given by

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (108a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (108b)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Hence, the Eq. ( 107 ) can be reduced to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (109)
  -- -------- -- -------

The equation above allows us to get a first notion of how we can make an
adiabatic approximation, since the last term couples eigenvectors with
distinct eigenvalues. Then, we define

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (110)
  -- -------- -- -------

and one finds a equation for @xmath given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (111)
  -- -------- -- -------

with the second term in right-hand side being the responsible for
coupling distinct Jordan-Lindblad eigenspaces during the evolution. If
we are able to use some strategy to minimize the effects of such term in
the above equation, we can approximate the dynamics to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (112)
  -- -------- -- -------

so that the adiabatic solution of the dynamics for @xmath can be written
as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (113)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we already used @xmath . In conclusion, if the system undergoes an
adiabatic dynamics along a non-unitary process, the evolved state can be
written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (114)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath being the generalized adiabatic phase which accompanying the
dynamics of the @xmath -th eigenvector. Throughout this thesis, the
superscript “1D” in some physical parameter, quantity or state means
that such element is valid if the adiabatic Lindbladian admits
one-dimensional Jordan block decomposition.

The adiabatic evolved state in Eq. ( 114 ) is not achieved in any
situation, but we can find conditions in which such dynamics is
expected. To derive adiabaticity conditions for open systems, let us
rewrite the Eq. ( 111 ) as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (115)
  -- -------- -- -------

so that one finds

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (116)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we defined

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (117)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, in order to achieve the adiabatic approximation we need to
satisfy

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (118)
  -- -------- -- -------

for all @xmath and @xmath . Now, by using the normalized time @xmath in
above equation, we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (119)
  -- -------- -- -------

with (here we adopt @xmath )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (120)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, we can use that (by defining @xmath )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (121)
  -- -------- -- -------

to rewrite @xmath as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (122)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Therefore, from above equation we have two different conditions to be
satisfied. In fact, if we want to get @xmath as smaller as possible, an
sufficient criterion to adiabaticity reads

  -- -- -------- -- --------
                    
        @xmath      (123a)
        @xmath      (123b)
  -- -- -------- -- --------

that allows us achieving the adiabatic behavior when satisfied for every
@xmath . If the above equation is satisfied for all @xmath , the @xmath
-th eigenvector evolves uncoupled from the other eigenvectors, but in
case the above equation is satisfied for all @xmath and @xmath , all
eigenvectors of the spectrum of @xmath evolve uncoupled from each other.
Moreover, it is worth highlighting here that the above conditions are
very similar to the Tong’s conditions @xmath and @xmath given in Eq. (
45 ). In fact, by setting @xmath , the second condition can be easily
rewritten as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (124)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have used that @xmath and the subscript @xmath denotes the
maximal value of the modulus, so that the validity of the condition
(C2-Tong) implies into validity of (C2). Notice that the above equation
can be viewed as a generalization of the condition @xmath for open
systems. In summary, we get the adiabaticity coefficients in open system
given by

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (125a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (125b)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

so that the conditions of the Eq. ( 123 ) can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (126)
  -- -------- -- -------

As it was observed by Sarandy and Lidar [ 25 , 5 ] , the nature of the
function @xmath is an important element that needs to be addressed in
details. In fact, since @xmath , the argument in the exponential of the
Eqs. ( 123 ) could admit both real and imaginary parts. On the one hand,
the imaginary part of @xmath can be neglected due to module in Eqs. (
124 ) and ( 123a ) (or due the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma [ 21 ] ). On the
other hand, the real part of @xmath could promote some divergence of the
quantities in Eq. ( 123 ) for long evolution times (due the integral in
argument of the exponential). Therefore, this means that adiabaticity is
not achieved in the regime where @xmath , but it would be possible to
find a range on the total evolution time @xmath so that the adiabatic
approximation could be obtained [ 5 ] . However, as we shall see in Sec.
9 , it is possible to find situations in which the adiabatic
approximation is achieved in the regime @xmath .

#### 8.2 General Jordan blocks

In a general case, where we have multi-dimensional Jordan blocks in
Eq. ( 29 ), one needs to start from the coupled set of equations given
in Eq. ( 107 ). Before, without loss of generality we write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (127)
  -- -------- -- -------

in which the argument @xmath could be associated with a dynamical phase
(in analogy with closed system case), and the Eq. ( 107 ) becomes

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (128)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

As already mentioned, the last term in above equation is the ‘diabatic’
contribution to the dynamics, so the Jordan blocks become uncoupled when
such term is small enough. Therefore, by following the same procedure as
before we can show that the adiabatic dynamics is approximately achieved
when

  -- -- -------- -- --------
                    
        @xmath      (129a)
        @xmath      (129b)
  -- -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath defines the generalized version of the Eq. ( 117 ) as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (130)
  -- -------- -- -------

so that @xmath for one-dimensional Jordan blocks. Therefore, if the
conditions in Eq. ( 129 ) are satisfied, the Eq. ( 128 ) can be
(approximately) written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (131)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the solution to @xmath from above equation is the open system
adiabatic solution . The above equation can be rewritten in a compact
way as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (132)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we already used @xmath . Here @xmath is a @xmath -dimensional
matrix whose elements are @xmath , @xmath is a vector with @xmath
components @xmath and @xmath an upper shift matrix which reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (133)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus, it is possible to see that the uncoupled evolution within a single
Jordan block is not necessarily obtained even when @xmath . In this
case, the most convenient way to write the adiabatic evolution operator
@xmath is from the definition of individual inner evolution operators
@xmath for each bloch given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (134)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the elements @xmath make explicit the case in which there is inner
transition in a single Jordan block and @xmath is a phase independent on
the inner structure of the block. The functions @xmath are determined
from solution of the Eq. ( 132 ), therefore it strongly depends on the
elements of matrix of @xmath . From this definition, the complete
evolution operator @xmath is conveniently written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (135)
  -- -------- -- -------

Notice that @xmath does not admit transitions between two eigenvectors
from different blocks, therefore it is our adiabatic evolution operator.
An immediate result from above operator is that, depending on the matrix
@xmath , we may be unable to find the analytical solution of the
adiabatic dynamics. It happens whenever the Jordan block of interest
does not admit solution to Eq. ( 132 ), so if our dynamics does not
start from a vector in a Jordan block with unknown solution for the
Eq. ( 132 ), we can analytically get the adiabatic solution.

Before following our discussion, it is important to mention that @xmath
admits an operator @xmath so that @xmath , where @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (136)
  -- -------- -- -------

with each operator @xmath obtained from

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (137)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the coefficients should satisfies

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (138)
  -- -------- -- -------

In addition, the operator @xmath can be designed in order to be
identified as the operator which “block-diagonalizes” @xmath , that is,
if we impose four additional conditions given by

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (139a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (139b)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

so one can show that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (140)
  -- -------- -- -------

A detailed proof of Eqs. ( 138 ) and ( 139 ) is provided in Appendix
\thechapter . In particular, from Eqs. ( 134 ) and ( 114 ) we can redo
the above analysis in order to show that the adiabatic evolution
operator for one-dimensional Jordan blocks reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (141)
  -- -------- -- -------

In fact, by starting the system in an arbitrary initial state @xmath ,
one shows that the solution @xmath given in Eq. ( 114 ) can be obtained
from above equation as @xmath . Moreover, as we shall see, the knowledge
of the evolution operator for adiabatic dynamics is the main element
required to study transitionless quantum driving in open systems. For
this reason, the evolution operators derived in this section are
important results of this thesis.

### 9 Application to adiabatic Deutsch algorithm

For the applications of adiabatic approximation in open system
considered in this thesis, the system dynamics is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (142)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath is the unitary part of the dynamics given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (143)
  -- -------- -- -------

and @xmath is the non-unitary contribution to the dynamics. In
particular, here we will be interested in a number of evolution given by
Lindblad master equation [ 24 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (144)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath are the Lindblad operators.

#### 9.1 Adiabatic Deutsch algorithm under dephasing

At beginning of the development of quantum computation the main question
was finding some concrete example (some algorithm) in which quantum
mechanically driven system could provide computation tasks with high
performance concerning its classical counterpart. In this sense, in
1985, David Deutsch derived a quantum algorithm in which we can get a
enhanced performance from its classical one [ 122 ] , called Deutsch
algorithm . Although the Deutsch’s algorithm is not a important
(powerful) algorithm in quantum computation, since it does not provide a
exponential gain concerning the its classical version, it is the first
main example of how powerful a quantum algorithm can be. The problem
addressed in Deutsch’s algorithm is how to determinate whether a
dichotomic real function @xmath is constant (the output result @xmath is
the same regardless the input value @xmath ) or balanced (the output
result @xmath assumes different values in according with the input value
@xmath ). The adiabatic version of such algorithm is obtained through
the operator @xmath which computes @xmath (oracle), given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (145)
  -- -------- -- -------

thus one can write the adiabatic Hamiltonian which implements the
algorithm as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (146)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath . At @xmath we have @xmath , so that the initial
input state is written as @xmath . One can show that, when the evolution
is slow enough, the adiabatic dynamics of the system driven by the
Hamiltonian @xmath will be given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (147)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and the subscript “cs” denotes that @xmath is obtained from
adiabatic solution for closed systems. By considering the system has its
dynamics governed by an environment so that the main effects on the
system is phase damping with rate @xmath , whose contribution reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (148)
  -- -------- -- -------

we describe the system evolution as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (149)
  -- -------- -- -------

In order to study the adiabatic dynamics of the system in according with
above equation, let us to rewrite it in superoperator formalism as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (150)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (151)
  -- -------- -- -------

whose the eigenvectors are (the superscript “t” denotes transpose)

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (152a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (152b)
     @xmath               (152c)
     @xmath   @xmath      (152d)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

and left eigenvectors

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (153a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (153b)
     @xmath               (153c)
     @xmath               (153d)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

with eigenvalues @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , where we defined
@xmath . The non-degenerate spectrum of @xmath shows that it can be
written in one-dimensional Jordan block form, so that the adiabatic
behavior of the system can be obtained from adiabatic solution discussed
in Sec. 8.1 . By writing the density matrix of the initial state @xmath
in superoperator formalism, one shows that the initial state can be
written as a linear combination of the vectors @xmath and @xmath as

  -- -- -- -------
           (154)
  -- -- -- -------

Hence, if we let the system evolves adiabatically, the evolved state is
obtained from Eq. ( 114 ) as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (155)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we already used that @xmath and @xmath , since from Eqs. ( 152 )
and ( 153 ) one can see that @xmath . Now, by rewrite the above equation
in matrix notation we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (156)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we can easily to determinate the components of the coherence
vector associated with density matrix @xmath and write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (157)
  -- -------- -- -------

In unitary dynamics limit @xmath , it is straightforward to see that we
recover the density matrix of the unitary dynamics given in Eq. ( 147 ).
However, the above solution is just valid when the adiabatic regime is
achieved, in other words, when the adiabaticity conditions discussed in
Sec. 8 . In this case more precisely, the relevant conditions are
related with one-dimensional Jordan blocks as discussed in Sec. 8.1 .
Thus, by defining @xmath , where we are using @xmath , we find the
non-null elements given by

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (158a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (158b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (158c)
     @xmath   @xmath      (158d)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

with @xmath . From above equation, it is possible to see that we can
simplify our discussion if we consider @xmath , so that @xmath ,
moreover, the rest of the above quantities are time-independent by using
this assumption. Thus, from Eqs. ( 125 ) we have the adiabaticity
coefficients given by

  -- -------- -- -- --------
                    
     @xmath         (159a)
     @xmath         (159b)
  -- -------- -- -- --------

where we already used that @xmath , so that @xmath . To end, the second
adiabatic coefficients are

  -- -------- -- -- --------
                    
     @xmath         (160a)
     @xmath         (160b)
  -- -------- -- -- --------

The other coefficients are zero and this means that some Lindblad-Jordan
eigenspaces are uncoupled between each other for any @xmath . In fact,
we found that @xmath so that the eigenvector @xmath evolves independent
on the @xmath -th eigenvector of @xmath . On the other hand, @xmath
means that the @xmath -th eigenvector of @xmath evolves independent on
the eigenvector @xmath .

In Eqs. ( 159 ), due to the positive value of the exponential in above
equations, the value of @xmath and @xmath should increase as @xmath ,
however in some cases there is a critical values @xmath and @xmath for
some values of @xmath . Therefore, as discussed in Ref. [ 25 ] , for a
range of values for @xmath the adiabatic behavior is approximately
obtained, but as @xmath grows the coefficients @xmath and @xmath become
big enough so that we achieve a regime in which an adiabaticity
breakdown happens. On the other hand, let us consider a more robust
analysis by studying the behavior of the other coefficients @xmath and
@xmath . The negative exponential in @xmath and @xmath shows a different
behavior because as @xmath increases the coefficient @xmath decreases.
Moreover, in the limit @xmath , one gets @xmath and @xmath . The same
result is obtained for the coefficients in Eqs. ( 160 ). From this
analysis, we have a scenario where in the limit of slow dynamics (
@xmath ) the eigenvector @xmath does not evolve uncoupled from @xmath
and @xmath (no adiabaticity), but the eigenvectors @xmath and @xmath are
decoupled from @xmath . However, interestingly, here we will discuss how
it is possible to proof that adiabaticity can be obtained in the regime
@xmath .

By using the Eqs. ( 158 ), from set of equations given in Eq. ( 109 ),
one finds @xmath and

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (161a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (161b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (161c)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Now, we use the discussion above in order to rewrite the Eqs. ( 161b )
and ( 161c ) in adiabatic regime as ( @xmath )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (162)
  -- -------- -- -------

As it was already discussed here, the coefficients @xmath and @xmath do
not depend on the other coefficients. However, by rewriting the Eq. (
161a ) in this regime we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (163)
  -- -------- -- -------

thus, note that if we consider the initial state such that @xmath , then
we find

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (164)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the adiabatic dynamics is obtained. From this example we conclude
that the adiabatic approximation in open system requires a more detailed
study, we mean, the validity conditions of the adiabatic dynamics alone
are not enough to guarantee the adiabatic behavior in open systems. In
conclusion, this discussion allows us to guarantee that the Deutsch
algorithm considered here achieves its adiabatic dynamics when
very-slowly driven fields are used. In fact, from Eq. ( 154 ) it is
possible to see that the initial condition @xmath is satisfied and the
dynamics is dictated by the Eq. ( 155 ).

#### 9.2 Experimental verification and asymptotic adiabatic dynamics for
open systems

In order to verify the theoretical results obtained in last section,
where the adiabatic dynamics in open system is obtained in asymptotic
long evolution total time, in this section we will present the
experimental verification in a trapped ion Ytterbium qubit [ 123 ] .
However, different from Sec. 4.2 where the dynamics is unitary, here we
need to consider the non-unitary effects on the dynamics because of the
long time coherence of the system [ 124 ] . In fact, as shown in
Appendix D.4 , while the Rabi frequency achieved in our experiment is of
the order of KHz, the natural dephasing rate @xmath of the system used
in our experiment was computed as @xmath Hz. For this reason, a
simulation of non-unitary effects on the two-level system is required
and it is done with the experimental apparatus shown in Fig. 10 . For
more details about the feature used in the simulation, see Appendix 4.2
.

As a quantifier of the adiabatic dynamics we define the fidelity between
two density matrices @xmath and @xmath given by

  -- -- -- -------
           (165)
  -- -- -- -------

from what we can set here two important fidelities. By putting @xmath as
the desired dynamics and @xmath as the numerical solution of the
dynamics, we define the theoretical fidelity @xmath . Otherwise, when
@xmath assume the values of the experimental density matrix (obtained
from tomography process) we have the experimental fidelity @xmath . Said
that, the theoretical/experimental fidelity of the system follows an
adiabatic path in open system as function of the total evolution time
@xmath for the Deutsch algorithm reads

  -- -- -- -------
           (166)
  -- -- -- -------

with @xmath being obtained through numerical solution (experimental
realization) and @xmath is given by Eq. ( 157 ). In case where @xmath ,
we have the adiabatic solution with high fidelity, otherwise the
dynamics is not adiabatic. For the experiment of the Deutsch algorithm
we take a balanced function as example and we set the parameter @xmath
KHz, so that in Fig. 11 we present the results for the fidelity @xmath .
In all of the experiments realized in this work, the error bars are
obtained from the standard deviation associated with 60 000 repetitions
of the experiment. For every fidelity, we perform state tomography by
measuring the qubit in the three Pauli bases ( @xmath , @xmath , and
@xmath ) [ 125 ] , with every basis measured @xmath times and repeated
10 times.

It is argued in Ref. [ 25 ] that there should be an optimal time for the
adiabatic approximation. While this is true in general, here fidelity
increases to its maximum as @xmath due to the initial conditions of the
system state. Actually, as discussed in previous section, the relation
between adiabatic and the decoherence time scales allows us to get an
adiabatic dynamics for very-slowly driven Lindbladian. It is also
important to stress here that the high fidelity for the adiabatic
behavior as @xmath does not imply in a high fidelity for the target
state of the algorithm. Indeed, the output for a balanced function
@xmath is the pure state @xmath , which can be represented by the
density operator @xmath given in Eq. ( 147 ). In order to quantify the
success of the algorithm under decoherence, we define the fidelity of
the real dynamics with respect to the target output density operator
given by

  -- -- -- -------
           (167)
  -- -- -- -------

Observe that, since we are evolving under decoherence, the target state
@xmath is distinct of the adiabatic solution given in Eq. ( 157 ), with
the adiabatic solution reducing to the target state in the limit of
vanishing decoherence. The fidelity with respect to the pure target
state in Fig. 11 b decays for long times as the decoherence rate
increases. This is in contrast with the fidelity with respect to the
mixed-state adiabatic evolution for open system in Fig. 11 a , which
goes to one as @xmath . This is because adiabaticity in open systems is
related to the decoupling of Jordan blocks in a nonunitary evolution,
which is only approximately equivalent (in the weak coupling regime) to
achieving a pure target state after a computation process. Therefore, by
focusing on pure target states, it is possible to see a preferred
time-window exhibiting maximum fidelity. In Fig. 11 a , we show two
windows with high fidelities, which are highlighted in light green
color. Notice that these windows also correspond to high fidelities in
Fig. 11 b , which means that adiabaticity in open systems is indeed able
to provide the target state of the Deutsch algorithm with high fidelity
for convenient measurement times. Therefore, this allows us to
understand a bit more how to obtain a favorable trade-off between the
necessary time to achieve the adiabatic regime and the (restrictive)
time scale of decohering effects.

Now, let us to generalize the above result for a more general situation.
By using the master equation, it follows that the superoperator @xmath
satisfies @xmath , since @xmath . Thus, if we consider the basis @xmath
, with @xmath , the first row of the matrix representation of @xmath is
vanishing. In fact, by adopting that the matrix elements of @xmath are
written as @xmath , we have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (168)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then @xmath has at least one eigenvalue zero with eigenvector constant.
We further assume that @xmath admits one-dimensional Jordan
decomposition and that there are no eigenvalue crossings in the spectrum
of @xmath . If we suitably order the basis so that the first eigenvalue
is @xmath , we get the associated eigenvector as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (169)
  -- -------- -- -------

As an immediate result, it follows that @xmath . In addition, such
vector is associated with the maximally mixed state @xmath . In fact,
the elements @xmath of @xmath are given by @xmath , so that in the basis
@xmath we have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (170)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we use that @xmath and @xmath . Therefore, by writing the density
matrix as in Eq. ( 13 ), it is possible to conclude that any physical
initial state @xmath must be written as a combination of @xmath and
other vectors @xmath . Hence, the initial state can be generally written
as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (171)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath are general complex coefficients.

The dynamics of the vanishing eigenvalue subspace can be studied from
equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (172)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we already used @xmath and @xmath . Now, using that the
supervectors @xmath and @xmath satisfy @xmath for any @xmath and @xmath
, we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and consequently we conclude that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (173)
  -- -------- -- -------

By using this result in Eq. ( 172 ), we get @xmath , which then implies
in @xmath .

Concerning the dynamics of the remaining eigenstates of @xmath , let us
assume that the initial state is such that a single Jordan block is
populated in addition to the block associated with @xmath , i.e., @xmath
for a single @xmath . We then start by looking at the adiabatic
condition in Eqs. ( 129 ), they tell us whether or not @xmath can evolve
decoupled from @xmath , but it does not provide any information whether
@xmath can evolve decoupled from @xmath . Assume that the adiabaticity
conditions hold asymptotically in time ( @xmath ), due to the fact that
@xmath . Provided the absence of level crossings as a function of time,
this condition selects the largest eigenvalue @xmath . Then, we write
@xmath , with @xmath denoting a complex coefficient. The solution reads
@xmath . On the other hand, once the parameter @xmath does not
necessarily satisfy the adiabaticity conditions, we generically write
@xmath , with @xmath and @xmath complex coefficients. However, by
imposing @xmath , it yields @xmath and consequently @xmath . By
iteratively applying this argument after decoupling @xmath , we finally
obtain that @xmath , stopping as @xmath becomes the largest eigenvalue
of the remaining set. Thus, by assuming a single @xmath in the initial
state, which is equivalent to assuming an initial superposition of only
two Jordan blocks, an adiabatic dynamics for @xmath is always achieved,
reading

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (174)
  -- -------- -- -------

### 10 Thermodynamics of adiabatic dynamics in open system

Thermodynamics is the knowledge field that encompasses physical
processes of systems composed by a large number of particles subject to
interaction with its environment. In particular, processes where some
amount of energy exchanges that may arise from the difference of
temperature between two systems (heat) or due to changes in force fields
acting on some system (work). In this sense, a new knowledge field
emerges when we use notions of thermodynamics to quantum mechanical
systems: quantum thermodynamics . Quantum thermodynamics deals with
thermodynamics quantities (heat and work) of systems that present
physical properties inherent to quantum systems (entanglement and
coherence, for example). For example, quantum thermodynamics may be used
to understand how coherence allows us to design efficient thermal
engines at quantum level [ 126 , 127 ] , and entanglement is used to
enhance charging power in quantum batteries [ 89 , 90 , 88 ] . Here we
will consider a particular question related with the thermodynamics of
adiabatic dynamics. To this end, we present a short discussion on how to
define heat and work for quantum mechanical systems driven by master
equations as in Eq. ( 19 ). Because it is not the scope of this thesis
to carefully present general results and features of quantum
thermodynamics, for further details on quantum thermodynamic and its
applications we recommend some relevant references [ 128 , 129 , 130 ,
131 , 132 ] .

#### 10.1 Work and heat in quantum thermodynamics

In classical thermodynamics, the first thermodynamics law establishes
that the internal energy variation of a system is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (175)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is some amount of heat exchange between the system of
interest and its environment, and @xmath is work realized by/on the
system. Here @xmath denotes that the heat and word depend on the
thermodynamics path followed by the system. In above equation, heat and
work are very well defined and it can be obtained from observation
macroscopic properties of the system. However, physical quantities in
quantum mechanics are obtained from its postulates and, consequently,
from Hermitean observables. In general, it has been shown that it is not
possible to associate an observable for the thermodynamic definition of
heat and of work [ 133 ] . Then, the starting point widely used to
define such physical quantities in quantum systems is from the
definition of internal energy [ 134 , 135 ] . If we consider a quantum
system driven by a time-dependent Hamiltonian @xmath , we can can
compute the instantaneous internal energy of the system as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (176)
  -- -------- -- -------

given the instantaneous system state at instant @xmath . Therefore, the
energy variation of the system can be directly obtained as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (177)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, in order to get a relation between the above equation with Eq. (
175 ), we need to consider two important observations. First, let be the
system evolving free from any external interaction with other systems,
that is, we have a closed system and it follows a unitary dynamics. In
this case, we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (178)
  -- -------- -- -------

because we can use the von Neumann equation for the density operator to
write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (179)
  -- -------- -- -------

valid whenever the system dynamics is unitary (closed system). That
means any variation in the internal energy of the system, through a
unitary dynamics, is due to time-dependence of the Hamiltonian.
Consequently, some external field control is required when we want to
change the system energy. For this reason, it is convenient to associate
the energy variation @xmath in interval @xmath with work realized by/on
the system @xmath as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (180)
  -- -------- -- -------

Because we have an addition in Eq. ( 175 ), when @xmath we say that work
is done on the system, otherwise work is done by the system. Here we
need to be careful because the above equation is valid for unitary
dynamics, so when the system is coupled to an external system, we cannot
identity the above equation as work in general [ 128 , 131 ] . On the
other hand, let us consider the case where the system is driven with a
time-independent Hamiltonian @xmath , then from Eq. ( 177 ) we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (181)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we used the Eq. ( 19 ) in last equality. The meaning of the
subscript “os” in above equation is because @xmath if the system is
coupled to some external system (reservoir), otherwise we get @xmath .
In fact, this result is immediate from Eq. ( 178 ) with @xmath . Then,
when the system is driven by time-independent fields, the energy of our
system just change if we couple it to some external system which will
transfer energy to our system of interest. For this reason, we identify
the above quantity with the amount of heat exchanged between the system
and its environment as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (182)
  -- -------- -- -------

An important remark here is that in steady state regime we get @xmath .
In fact, because we have that the steady state @xmath satisfies @xmath ,
in the limit where @xmath , we get @xmath . From this result, if the
dynamics admits a steady state, we can establish a maximum amount of
heat exchanged between system and reservoir as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (183)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the time required to achieve the steady state @xmath .

#### 10.2 Adiabatic process versus adiabatic dynamics

In thermodynamics, by definition adiabaticity is associated to a process
with no heat exchange between the system and its reservoir. On the other
hand, as discussed in Sec. 8 , adiabaticity in dynamics of quantum
systems is well defined in a different way. Therefore, the question that
arises here is: How are thermodynamics adiabatic processes related with
an adiabatic dynamics? As a preliminary result (but insufficient yet),
we can restrict our analysis to the closed system case. In general, as
already discussed here, unitary processes do not admit energy
transference as heat, since no system is coupled to our main system.
Because this result is independent on the kind of dynamics (adiabatic or
not), we can say that adiabatic processes in closed systems are not
related with an adiabatic dynamics . Therefore, in order to give a more
complete study on this issue, it is convenient to consider an open
system dynamics because some heat exchange is admissible. To this end,
we need to introduce heat and work in a general way from superoperator
formalism, where adiabatic dynamics in open system is well defined.

Therefore, let us consider the heat exchange as given in Eq. ( 181 ). To
derive the corresponding expression in the superoperator formalism we
first define the basis of operators given by @xmath , @xmath (again we
are using @xmath ), where @xmath . In this basis, we can write @xmath
and @xmath generically as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (184)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have @xmath and @xmath . Then, we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (185)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, we use the definition of the matrix elements of the superoperator
@xmath , associated with @xmath , which reads @xmath , so that we write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (186)
  -- -------- -- -------

In conclusion, by defining the vector elements

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath               (187)
     @xmath   @xmath      (188)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

we can rewrite Eq. ( 186 ), yielding

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (189)
  -- -------- -- -------

Equivalently, from Eq. ( 180 ) we can use the Eq. ( 184 ) to write
@xmath and, consequently

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (190)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we used the definition of the coefficients @xmath in last
equality. Now, by using Eqs. ( 187 ) and ( 188 ) into above equation, we
conclude that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (191)
  -- -------- -- -------

To end, since the system is evolving under a non-unitary dynamics, some
entropy variation is computed along the evolution. Here we use the
entropy variation as provided by the variation in Von Neumann entropy
given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (192)
  -- -------- -- -------

that can be written in a differential way as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (193)
  -- -------- -- -------

and by using that @xmath , because @xmath , and @xmath we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (194)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, let us to write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (195)
  -- -------- -- -------

so that we can define the vectors @xmath associated to @xmath with
components @xmath obtained as @xmath . Thus, we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (196)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus, from Eqs. ( 185 ), ( 191 ) and ( 196 ) we can study the
thermodynamics of adiabatic dynamics in a general framework. However,
since work of an adiabatic dynamics has been addressed in a number of
applications, here we are interested in study the implications of the
adiabatic dynamics in the expression of heat derived in Eqs. ( 185 )
and ( 196 ). To this end, let us consider the most general case in which
the system starts from a superposition @xmath , associated with the
initial arbitrary matrix density @xmath . Then, if we take into account
the situations where the system evolves adiabatically, we use the
evolution operator in Eqs. ( 135 ) and ( 134 ) to write the evolved as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (197)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where we defined @xmath . By using the above result, from Eq. ( 189 ) we
write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (198)
  -- -------- -- -------

as the amount of heat exchanged between the system and its environment
along an adiabatic dynamics in open systems. A more useful expression
can be found using the quasi-eigenvector equation for @xmath given in
Eq. ( 30 ) and reads as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (199)
  -- -------- -- -------

Moreover, let us consider the case where we have an one-dimensional
Jordan block decomposition of @xmath . In this case, we use the
adiabatic solution in Eq. ( 189 ) to write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (200)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Eqs. ( 199 ) and ( 200 ) constitute the main result of this section,
where it is evident the possibility of heat exchange during an adiabatic
dynamics in open system. In addition, the Eq. ( 200 ) allows us to find
a condition for achieving an adiabatic process through an adiabatic
dynamics. In fact, note that if we start the dynamics from a
superposition of eigenvectors @xmath of @xmath with @xmath for all
@xmath , we get @xmath for all @xmath . In conclusion, we can establish
that an adiabatic dynamics in quantum mechanics is not in general
associated with an adiabatic process in quantum thermodynamics, with a
sufficient condition for thermal adiabaticity being the evolution within
an eigenstate set with vanishing eigenvalue of @xmath .

To end, from Eq. ( 196 ), we can write the von Neumann entropy variation
as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so that we can use the Eq. ( 30 ) to write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (201)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , with @xmath standing for the adiabatic evolved state
associated with @xmath .

Thermal adiabaticity for a qubit adiabatic dynamics – As an illustration
of how adiabatic dynamics is an adiabatic process, let us begin by
considering a two-level system initialized in a thermal equilibrium
state @xmath for the Hamiltonian @xmath at inverse temperature @xmath ,
where @xmath and @xmath are the Boltzmann’s constant and the absolute
temperature, respectively. Now, let the system be governed by a Lindblad
equation, where the environment acts as a dephasing channel in the
energy eigenstate basis @xmath of @xmath . Thus, we describe the
coupling between the system and its reservoir through

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (202)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , with @xmath being the instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath
, here we are assuming @xmath for all @xmath . In this case, the set of
eigenvectors of @xmath can be obtained from set of operators @xmath ,
because we have

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (203)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Now, by computing the second term in above equation we get

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (204)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

so that we can write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (205)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we conclude that @xmath satisfies the eigenvalue equation @xmath
with

  -- -- -- -------
           (206)
  -- -- -- -------

Therefore, by writing @xmath in superoperator formalism the of @xmath ,
with components @xmath , the eigenvalue equation for @xmath can be
written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (207)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . Since we are considering the initial state as a thermal
state, in the superoperator formalism the initial state @xmath , we can
write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (208)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the partition function of the system. Note that, since
@xmath is given by a superposition of eigenvectors of @xmath with
eigenvalue @xmath for all @xmath , we obtain from Eq. ( 200 ) that
@xmath for all @xmath whenever the evolution is adiabatic. Therefore,
thermal adiabaticity is achieved for an arbitrary open-system adiabatic
dynamics subject to dephasing in the energy eigenbasis. Hence, any
internal energy variation for this situation should be identified as
work .

#### 10.3 Experimental realization of heat exchange in adiabatic
dynamics

Now, we will consider a case where the open system dynamics is adiabatic
and some amount of heat is exchanged between system and reservoir. The
system used here is the same as before, a two level system evolving
under dephasing. However, here we conveniently change the decohering
basis and now the decohering acts in computational basis @xmath and
@xmath , instead the eigenstate basis of @xmath . Then the dynamics of
the system is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (209)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath . Since we are interested in studying the heat transfer
during the adiabatic dynamics, we drive the system with a
time-independent Hamiltonian, so that @xmath for all @xmath and
therefore any variation in internal energy of the system is due to heat
flux. Moreover, because we want to drive the system through an adiabatic
dynamics, the parameter @xmath needs to be time-dependent.

The system is initialized in the thermal of @xmath at inverse
temperature @xmath written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (210)
  -- -------- -- -------

where rewrite the above state in superoperator formalism as the state
@xmath in the basis @xmath as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (211)
  -- -------- -- -------

with the basis @xmath ( @xmath ) defined in Eq. ( 23 ). In this
dynamics, the superoperator @xmath associated with the generator @xmath
reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (212)
  -- -------- -- -------

It is possible to show that the set @xmath satisfies the eigenvalue
equation for @xmath as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (213)
  -- -------- -- -------

so, if the dynamics is adiabatic, we can write the evolved state as
@xmath , where @xmath and @xmath because the coefficients evolve
independently form each other. Thus, from the adiabatic solution in open
quantum system given in Eq. ( 114 ), we obtain @xmath and @xmath , so
that we can use @xmath and @xmath to obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (214)
  -- -------- -- -------

Notice that by rewriting the above equation in the standard operator
formalism, one gets

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (215)
  -- -------- -- -------

moreover, by using this formalism, it is also possible to show that the
dephasing channel can be used as a thermalization process if we suitably
choose the parameter @xmath and the total evolution time @xmath . In
fact, we can define a new inverse temperature @xmath so that Eq. ( 214 )
behaves as thermal state, namely,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (216)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we immediately identify

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (217)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, we use the Eq. ( 199 ) to compute the exchanged heat during an
infinitesimal time interval @xmath as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (218)
  -- -------- -- -------

and therefore we get the total exchanged heat as a function of the total
evolution time @xmath in which the system remains coupled to reservoir
as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (219)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the average dephasing rate during @xmath . A first
remark here is that @xmath for any value of @xmath and @xmath , so this
means that the reservoir here works as an artificial thermal reservoir
at inverse temperature @xmath . We also considered a similar analysis in
an experimental simulation of a thermal engine in all optical
experimental setup [ 136 ] . In addition, due to the negative argument
in the exponential, the higher the mean-value of @xmath the faster the
heat exchange ends. Then, we can further compute the maximum exchanged
heat from Eq. ( 219 ), in the limit @xmath , as a quantity independent
of the environment parameters and given by @xmath . This result can be
also obtained from Eqs. ( 183 ) and ( 215 ) by using the asymptotic
steady state @xmath . It would be worth highlighting that, for quantum
thermal machines weakly coupled to thermal reservoirs at different
temperatures [ 134 ] , the maximum heat @xmath is obtained with
high-temperature hot reservoirs [ 137 , 138 , 139 ] .

The experimental realization of the above results was done through the
trapped ion system already used previously, but in this case we need to
consider an additional challenger due to the parameter @xmath to be
time-dependent. To do that, it is used the same procedure as before with
an additional element able to provide a time-dependent decohering
quantum channel with high controllability. For further details, please
see Appendix D.4 . In Fig. 12 we show the experimental results for the
heat exchange @xmath as a function of @xmath , where we have chosen
@xmath , where here the parameter @xmath is experimentally controlled
through the time interval associated to the action of our decohering
quantum channel. The solid curves in Fig. 12 are computed from Eq. ( 219
), while the experimental points are directly computed through the
variation of internal energy as @xmath , where @xmath . The computation
of @xmath is directly obtained from quantum state tomography of @xmath
for each value of @xmath . Although the maximum exchanged heat is
independent of @xmath , the initial dephasing rate @xmath affects the
power for which the system exchanges heat with the reservoir for a given
evolution time @xmath .

By completeness and to provide a more detailed view of this heat
exchange, we analyze the von Neumann entropy during the evolution. From
Eq. ( 196 ), for the particular case of an one-dimensional Jordan block
decomposition, we write the entropy variation in our dynamics as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (220)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we used that @xmath . By computing @xmath , where we find

  -- -- -- -------
           (221)
  -- -- -- -------

with @xmath . Then, from the set of adopted values for our parameters
and the spectrum of the Lindbladian, we conclude that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (222)
  -- -------- -- -------

Notice that the relation between heat and entropy can be obtained by
rewriting the exchanged heat @xmath in the interval @xmath as @xmath .
In conclusion, the energy variation can indeed be identified as heat
exchanged along the adiabatic dynamics. Indeed, by computing the
thermodynamic relation between @xmath and @xmath we get @xmath , where
@xmath is the inverse temperature of the simulated thermal bath shown in
Eq. ( 217 ).

To guarantee that the amount of heat shown in Fig. 12 are associated
with an exchange heat in an adiabatic dynamics, we computed the fidelity
@xmath between the evolved state (solution of the Eq. ( 209 )) and the
adiabatic solution given in Eq. ( 215 ). In Table 1 we show the minimum
value of the fidelity along the evolution, that is, we compute the
quantity @xmath . From Table 1 it is possible to see that all of heat
exchange behavior shown in Fig. 12 are associated with an adiabatic
dynamics in open system with high fidelity.

Despite we have provided a specific open-system adiabatic evolution, we
can determine infinite classes of system-environment interactions
exhibiting the same amount of heat exchange @xmath . In particular,
there are infinite engineered environments that are able to extract a
maximum heat amount @xmath . In fact, it is possible to determine
infinite classes of systems exhibiting the same amount of heat exchange
@xmath . This is provided in Theorem 1 below.

###### Theorem \thechapter.1.

Let @xmath be an open quantum system governed by a time-local master
equation in the form @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath . The Hamiltonian
@xmath is taken as a constant operator so that no work is realized by/on
the system. Assume that the heat exchange between @xmath and its
reservoir during the quantum evolution is given by @xmath . Then, any
unitarily related adiabatic dynamics driven by @xmath , where @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath , for some constant unitary @xmath , implies in an
equivalent heat exchange @xmath .

-   Let us consider that @xmath is solution of

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (223)
      -- -------- -- -------

    so, by multiplying both sides of the above equation by @xmath (on
    the left-hand-side) and @xmath (on the right-hand-side), we get

      -- -------- -------- -- -------
         @xmath   @xmath      
                  @xmath      (224)
      -- -------- -------- -- -------

    thus, by using the relations @xmath and @xmath , we find

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (225)
      -- -------- -- -------

    where @xmath . In conclusion, we get that @xmath is a solution of

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (226)
      -- -------- -- -------

    where

      -- -------- -------- -- -------
         @xmath   @xmath      (227)
         @xmath   @xmath      (228)
      -- -------- -------- -- -------

    Now, by taking into account that the Hamiltonian @xmath is a
    constant operator, we have that no work is realized by/on the
    system. Then, by computing the amount of heat extracted from the
    system in the prime dynamics during an interval @xmath , we obtain

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (229)
      -- -------- -- -------

    where, by definition, we can use @xmath , @xmath . Hence

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (230)
      -- -------- -- -------

    where we have used the cyclical property of the trace and that
    @xmath . @xmath

As an example of application of the above theorem, let us consider a
system-reservoir interaction governed by @xmath (bit-flip channel). We
can then show that the results previously obtained for dephasing can be
reproduced if the quantum system is initially prepared in thermal state
of @xmath . Such a result is clear if we choose @xmath . Then, it
follows that @xmath and @xmath , where @xmath are rotation matrices with
angle @xmath around @xmath -axes for the case of a single qubit. Thus,
the above theorem assures that the maximum exchanged heat will be @xmath
.

### 11 Conclusions of this chapter

In this chapter we studied foundations on adiabatic dynamics of open
system, where we could to apply our results in context of quantum
thermodynamics. First, we have shown that, in completeness with the
results present in literature [ 25 , 5 ] , we have shown a class of
quantum systems where the adiabatic approximation for open systems holds
in the asymptotic time limit @xmath . However, such result is an
arbitrarily valid consequence of the one-dimensional Jordan
decomposition of the Lindblad superoperator that drives the system, the
absence of level crossings, and the initialization of the system as a
superposition of only two eigenstates of such operator. As an
application, we studied both theoretical and experimental implementation
of an adiabatic version of the Deutsch algorithm, analyzing its run-time
optimality in open systems. In contrast with the general picture
previously derived in the literature [ 25 , 5 ] , we have shown that the
adiabatic approximation for open systems holds in the asymptotic time
limit @xmath in the Deutsch algorithm. However, it is worth mentioning
that, if we are interested in maximizing the probability of measuring
the target (pure) state as the outcome of the algorithm, instead of the
open system adiabatic mixed-state density operator, then there is an
optimal time window for the system measurement (for previously related
discussions on this topic, see also Refs. [ 7 , 5 , 22 , 140 ] ).
Concerning the experimental results, we have reported, to the best of
our knowledge, the first experimental investigation of the adiabatic
approximation in a fully controllable open system, where the total
evolution time and the decoherence rates can be freely set to verify the
quantitative validity conditions for the adiabatic behavior. By using a
hyperfine qubit encoded in ground-state energy levels of a trapped
Ytterbium ion, all of the theoretical predictions highlighted above have
been successfully realized.

As an application, we studied the thermodynamics of adiabatic evolutions
in context of open systems. From the general approach for adiabaticity
in open quantum systems discussed here, we provided a relationship
between adiabaticity in quantum mechanics and in quantum thermodynamics.
In particular, we derived a sufficient condition for which the adiabatic
dynamics in open quantum systems leads to adiabatic processes in
thermodynamics. By using a particular example of a single qubit
undergoing an open-system adiabatic evolution path, we have illustrated
the existence of both adiabatic and diabatic regimes in quantum
thermodynamics, computing the associated heat fluxes in the processes.
As a further result, we also proved the existence of an infinite family
of decohering systems exhibiting the same maximum heat exchange. From
the experimental side, we have realized adiabatic open-system evolutions
using an Ytterbium trapped ion, with its hyperfine energy level encoding
a qubit (work substance). In particular, heat exchange and entropy
production can be optimized along the adiabatic path as a function of
the total evolution time. Our implementation exhibits high
controllability, opening perspectives for analyzing thermal machines (or
refrigerators) in open quantum systems under adiabatic evolutions. The
associated effects of the engineered reservoirs on the thermal
efficiencies are left for future research.

Then, the results presented in this chapter provide a framework to
exploit the experimental realization of adiabaticity in quantum
computing under decoherence, tackling features such as optimal run-time
of an algorithm, asymptotic time behavior, competition between adiabatic
and relaxation time-scales, outcome fidelities, thermodynamic processes
via adiabatic dynamics, among others.

## Chapter \thechapter Transitionless Quantum Driving in closed systems
\lettrine

[lines=3,lhang=0.33,nindent=0em] A diabatic dynamics is a useful
approach to achieve a number of quantum tasks. However, as already
previously highlighted, the constraints on the speed evolution is a
problem when we consider the undesired effects. As a strategy to bypass
these undesired effects in adiabatic dynamics, Mustafa Demirplak and
Stuart A. Rice proposed a special dynamics that allows us to mimic an
adiabatic dynamics without the requirement of slowly driving the system.
The problem solved by Demirplak and Rice in 2003 is how to speed up an
adiabatic dynamics [ 26 ] . To this end, Demirplak and Rice showed how
to use an auxiliary field to inhibit natural transitions between energy
level of the system when we implement fast evolutions. This additional
field constitutes a counter diabatic field paradigm , as mentioned in
their revised paper, published two years later [ 27 ] . In this chapter
we will review the method developed by Demirplak and Rice, revisited
some years later by Michael Victor Berry [ 50 ] . As a contribution of
this thesis to this field, we show how to generalize such method and we
highlight the benefits we can get from this generalized approach. In
recent years, the term “counter diabatic” has been replaced by the
terminology transitionless quantum driving (TQD) used by Berry [ 50 ] .
Here we will use the Berry’s terminology and the term “counter diabatic”
will be used whenever it is convenient for us. The results presented in
this chapter are associated with the following works:

### 12 Standard TQD in closed quantum systems

Consider @xmath the driven reference (adiabatic) Hamiltonian of a
quantum system with dimension @xmath , @xmath the set of instantaneous
eigenstates of @xmath with eigenvalues @xmath . The solution for the
dynamics of the system that evolves through an adiabatic path
(trajectory) is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (231)
  -- -------- -- -------

with the coefficients @xmath defined by the initial state of the system
@xmath . By convenience in the notation, from now on we will define the
set of adiabatic phase @xmath as quantal phase given by @xmath , where
@xmath and @xmath are the dynamical and geometrical phases defined as [
81 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (232)
  -- -------- -- -------

In this way, it is straightforward to define the evolution operator
@xmath of an adiabatic dynamics as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (233)
  -- -------- -- -------

because we can check that @xmath . From the above operator @xmath ,
Demirplak and Rice raised the question whether there is another
Hamiltonian (not the adiabatic) that shares of the same evolution
operator. Since we know the evolution operator of a given dynamics, we
can use an inverse engineering approach to determinate the Hamiltonian
that implements such dynamics. The Hamiltonian that mimics the adiabatic
dynamics can be obtained from inverse engineering using that

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (234)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where we already used the Eqs. ( 232 ) and @xmath , the spectral
decomposition of @xmath . A first point to be highlighted here is the
absence of any condition on the total evolution time, so a system driven
by the above Hamiltonian follows an adiabatic path framed by the
reference Hamiltonian @xmath for any instant @xmath . More rigorously,
we showed that naturally the speed of the evolution is constrained by
the energy cost of the implementation, with faster evolutions being more
energy demanding [ 10 ] . Therefore, note that this approach requires
our ability to include external fields to the original field used to
implement @xmath . These additional fields work as inhibitors of
diabatic transitions between energy levels of the system. For this
reason, these fields has been referred as counter diabatic fields and
the additional term in @xmath as counter diabatic Hamiltonian . Thus, we
write @xmath , with

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (235)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here we are using the label “std” in @xmath to denote the Hamiltonian
that implements a TQD as provided by the “standard” model developed by
Demirplak and Rice. It is convenient because we shall see how to
generalize this approach, in which this approach is recovered as
particular case of the generalized approach.

The standard TQD method has been investigated in a number of different
applications, where different discussions on the energetic cost of
implementing such evolution has been considered. For example, studies on
energetic cost of standard TQD were considered through the Frobenius
norm of the Hamiltonian [ 10 , 33 , 32 ] , quantum speed limit
inequalities [ 51 ] and average thermodynamics work [ 141 ] . In all of
these studies, standard TQD is more costing than its adiabatic
counterpart and we can say that speed up adiabatic processes through
this method demands additional energy resources. However, in this
section we will present how to provide more efficient (energetically)
TQD Hamiltonian by exploring the Gauge freedom of the phases that
accompanying the adiabatic and, consequently, the TQD evolution.

### 13 Generalized TQD in closed quantum systems

In some protocols of inverse engineering of a Hamiltonian [ 142 , 31 ] ,
the starting point is the equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (236)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath being the operator that describes the desired evolution.
Now, observe that there are a number of adiabatic processes in which the
quantal phases collected along the evolution can be negligible,
situations where we are interested in the adiabatic trajectory
associated to a single eigenstate of @xmath . For this reason, we can
use the quantal phases that accompanying a TQD as a free parameter and
define the generalized TQD evolution operator given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (237)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath being arbitrary parameters, that can be adjusted to minimize
some physical quantity, for example. The TQD Hamiltonian considered in
previous section is a particular Hamiltonian that can be found from
above equation. In fact, by adopting the choice @xmath , we get @xmath .
The operator @xmath implements an generalized TQD, because it allows for
a TQD with arbitrary quantal phases, consequently we can find the
generalized TQD Hamiltonian as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (238)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Now, if we identify the functions @xmath as it has originally been
identified with the adiabatic phase @xmath , which exactly mimics an
adiabatic evolution, then we can write @xmath as @xmath . Now, it is
relevant to highlight here the absence of the original reference
Hamiltonian @xmath in generalized TQD Hamiltonian @xmath . This result
makes clear that we do not need to know how to implement @xmath if we
want to drive the system through an adiabatic trajectory of @xmath via a
TQD method. Moreover, if we define the energy cost of TQD using the
Frobenius norm, as done in Refs. [ 10 , 32 , 33 ] , one notes that
@xmath . Therefore, a question is raised here: Is the generalized TQD
method energetically more efficient than the standard one?

#### 13.1 Energetically optimal transitionless quantum driving

As already mentioned, there is a number of situations for which an
adiabatic process do not need to be mimicked exactly, but only assure
that the system is kept in an instantaneous eigenstate of the original
Hamiltonian @xmath (independently of its associated quantum phase) [ 10
, 32 , 33 , 64 , 65 , 66 , 49 , 67 , 68 , 42 , 69 , 70 , 41 ] . This
generalized dynamics in terms of arbitrary phases @xmath will be denoted
as a transitionless evolution. Now, we will show that @xmath can be
nontrivially optimized in transitionless evolutions both in terms of
energy cost and robustness against decoherence effects. In this
direction, we adopt as a measure of energy cost the average
Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the Hamiltonian throughout the evolution, which
is given by [ 45 , 10 , 51 , 143 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (239)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath denotes the total evolution time. The energy cost @xmath
aims at identifying changes in the energy coupling constants and gap
structure, which typically account for the effort of speeding up
adiabatic processes. It is a well-defined measure for finite-dimensional
Hamiltonians exhibiting non-degeneracies in their energy spectra, so it
is applicable, e.g., for generic systems composed of a finite number of
quantum bits (qubits) under magnetic or electric fields (see Refs. [ 143
, 45 ] for similar cost measures). More specially, the above energy
quantifier can be adequately applied to the Hamiltonians that describe
the quantum systems within the scope of this thesis. Note that Eq. ( 239
) is non-invariant with respect to a change of the zero energy offset,
but we can adopt a fixed reference frame where it can be used to
quantify the energy cost involved in attempts of accelerating the
adiabatic path, either via an increasing of the energy gap in the
adiabatic approach or via a reduction of @xmath by adjusting the
relevant energy couplings in the counter-diabatic theory. In addition,
as @xmath can be set by the quantum speed limit [ 144 ] , Eq. ( 239 )
allows us to establish a trade-off between speed and energy cost for an
arbitrary dynamics [ 10 , 51 ] . For instance, in NMR experimental
setups, the quantity @xmath represents how intense a magnetic field
@xmath is expected to be in order to control the speed of such a
dynamics. In conclusion, the quantifier defined in Eq. ( 239 ) will be
used here to measure the energy cost expanded by a generalized TQD with
regards to its standard and adiabatic counterparts.

As a first result, we discuss how, for a fixed time @xmath , the
generalized approach of TQD allows us to minimize the energy cost in a
TQD by a suitable choice of the arbitrary parameters @xmath . This
optimization can be analytically derived, which is established by
Theorem \thechapter .1 below (its derivation is provided in Appendix G
).

###### Theorem \thechapter.1.

Consider a closed quantum system under adiabatic evolution governed by a
Hamiltonian @xmath . The energy cost to implement its generalized
transitionless counterpart, driven by the Hamiltonian @xmath , can be
minimized by setting

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (240)
  -- -------- -- -------

In particular, for any evolution that satisfies the quantum
parallel-transport condition, given by @xmath [ 81 ] , the energy cost
to implement a transitionless evolution is always optimized by choosing
@xmath . This approach is useful for providing both realistic and
energetically optimal Hamiltonians in several physical scenarios. For
example, by considering nuclear spins driven by a magnetic field @xmath
in a nuclear magnetic resonance setup, the energy cost can be optimized
by adjusting @xmath such that the magnitude @xmath of the magnetic field
is reduced, since @xmath .

As a second result, it is possible to proof that the generalized TQD
approach can be used as a tool to yield time-independent Hamiltonians
for transitionless evolutions. In general, the Hamiltonian @xmath has
its form constrained both by the choice of the phases @xmath and by
eigenstates of the adiabatic Hamiltonian @xmath . Thus, now we delineate
under what conditions we can choose the set @xmath in order to obtain a
time-independent Hamiltonian for a transitionless evolution. To answer
this question, we impose @xmath considering arbitrary phases @xmath .
This leads to the Theorem \thechapter .2 below (its derivation is
provided in Appendix G ).

###### Theorem \thechapter.2.

Let @xmath be a discrete quantum Hamiltonian, with @xmath denoting its
set of instantaneous eigenstates. If @xmath satisfies @xmath , with
@xmath complex constants @xmath @xmath , then a family of
time-independent Hamiltonians @xmath for generalized transitionless
evolutions can be defined by setting @xmath , with @xmath a single
arbitrary real constant @xmath .

In case where the hypothesis of the Theorem \thechapter .2 are satisfied
and the parallel-transport condition is also satisfied for all
eigenstates of @xmath , we can get an energetically optimal
time-independent TQD Hamiltonian by setting @xmath , as we shall see
soon. Although we use the Frobenius norm of the Hamiltonian as
measurement of energy cost, we can define different quantifiers and
physical quantities to be optimized using these arbitrary quantal
phases. Here we will present three applications where different
approaches to energy cost optimization are considered.

#### 13.2 Experimental implementation of Landau-Zener transitionless
dynamics

As a first application, let us consider the dynamics of a two-level
quantum system, i.e., a qubit, evolving under the Landau-Zener
Hamiltonian (here we use the normalized time @xmath )

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (241)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a detuning, @xmath is the Rabi frequency and the time
@xmath is defined for the interval @xmath . The adiabatic dynamic is
obtained from a very-slow continuum evolution for the Hamiltonian @xmath
. The above equation can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (242)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath a dimensionless time-dependent parameter associated with the
Rabi frequency, with @xmath . This Hamiltonian describes transitions in
two-level systems exhibiting anti-crossings in its energy spectrum [ 145
] . In particular, it can be applied, e.g., to perform adiabatic
population transfer in a two-level system driven by a chirped field [ 26
] and to investigate molecular collision processes [ 146 ] . The
instantaneous ground @xmath and first excited @xmath states of @xmath
are

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (243a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (243b)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The system is initialized in the ground state @xmath of @xmath . By
considering a unitary dynamics and a sufficiently large total evolution
time (adiabatic time), the qubit evolves to the instantaneous ground
state @xmath of @xmath . By applying the standard TQD approach, it is
possible to get the TQD Hamiltonian @xmath given by @xmath , where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (244)
  -- -------- -- -------

because the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian @xmath the parallel-transport
condition.

Now, let us discuss the generalized transitionless dynamics theory for
the Landau-Zener model. For optimal energy cost, Eq. ( 240 ) establishes
@xmath for the states in Eqs. ( 243 ). Therefore, the optimal
Hamiltonian @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (245)
  -- -------- -- -------

From Eq. ( 244 ), we can see that @xmath satisfies the hypotheses of
Theorem \thechapter .2 if, and only if, we choose the linear
interpolation @xmath . Thus, we adopt this choice for simplicity and,
consequently, we have @xmath . We observe that a complete (avoided)
level crossing picture for the Landau-Zener model is described by
varying the parameter @xmath from @xmath to @xmath . Here, we are taking
a narrower range for @xmath , which simplifies the description of the
transitionless dynamics for the model.

Again, the experimental realization was done using the Ytterbium trapped
ion setup shown in Fig. ( 10 ). We use it because we aim to investigate
both energy cost and robustness against decoherence of the optimal TQD
scheme. In our experiment we used both resonant and off-resonant
microwaves fields to implement adiabatic and TQD dynamics. The adiabatic
Hamiltonian dynamics was performed by using a non-resonant microwave,
where the time-dependent effective Rabi frequency is given by @xmath .
This is also known as “generalized” Rabi frequency, i.e, Rabi frequency
with detuning [ 147 , 148 , 149 ] . To drive the system by using the
standard TQD, we use an independent microwave to simulate the
counter-diabatic term @xmath . This additional field is a resonant
microwave ( @xmath ), whose Rabi frequency can be obtained from @xmath
in Eq. ( 244 ) as @xmath . On the other hand, different from standard
TQD Hamiltonian, the optimal dynamics driven by @xmath could be
implemented using a single resonant microwave with Rabi frequency @xmath
, where we have turned-off the non-resonant field used for simulate
@xmath .

In order to quantify the energy resources employed in the quantum
evolution, we study the intensity of the fields used to perform the
adiabatic dynamics as well as standard and optimal TQD. The field
intensity is associated with the Rabi frequency through the relation
@xmath , where @xmath is a constant that depends on the microwave
amplifier. Considering the whole evolution time, we can define the
average intensity field as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (246)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we use the parametrization @xmath . Thus, from Eqs. ( 241 ), ( 244
) and ( 245 ), we get the field intensity for the adiabatic, standard
and optimal TQD Hamiltonian, respectively, as

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (247a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (247b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (247c)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Notice that for the standard TQD we find @xmath , since the standard TQD
field is composed by both the adiabatic and the optimal TQD
contributions. The parameter @xmath is a characteristic parameter that
depends on the device used to amplify and modulate the driving microwave
acting on the system. Then, in order to give a description of the energy
cost independent of any auxiliary device, we take the relative field
intensities expressed in unities of the adiabatic intensity @xmath . By
doing this, it is possible to disregard the constant @xmath . In fact,
we define @xmath and @xmath , and adopt the normalization @xmath .

From Eqs. ( 247 ), it is possible to identify a value of @xmath , for
the total evolution time, in which the intensity fields for implementing
optimal TQD becomes less intense than the adiabatic intensity. In fact,
firstly note that @xmath , but on the other side, we can see that the
value of @xmath implies into @xmath or @xmath . So, here we impose the
desired situation in which @xmath to obtain the relation

  -- -- -- -------
           (248)
  -- -- -- -------

therefore we conclude that, in this situation, @xmath should satisfy

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (249)
  -- -------- -- -------

This result shows the existence of a boundary total evolution time
@xmath given by

  -- -- -- -------
           (250)
  -- -- -- -------

so that if @xmath we get @xmath , otherwise we find @xmath . In case
where @xmath we have identical field intensities. It would be worth
highlighting that @xmath does not depend on the @xmath . Notice that,
after @xmath , the shortcut to adiabaticity defined by the optimal TQD
can be implemented by spending less energy resources, as measured by the
field intensity, than the adiabatic approach.

It is important to mention here that the energy cost as computed by the
Frobenius norm of the Hamiltonian does not represents a real energy
cost. In fact, it is possible to show that the norm of the Hamiltonian
@xmath depends on the parameter @xmath , but since of @xmath can changed
without change the microwave intensity, the norm of @xmath cannot be
used as a realistic cost of the dynamics in this particular case.
However, if we consider this analysis, the Theorem \thechapter .1
guarantees that @xmath for every @xmath . Thus, because we spend less
energy with the optimal TQD scheme, it is convenient to study the impact
of this optimal TQD on the robustness of the dynamics against
decoherence. To do a direct comparison between adiabatic dynamics,
standard and optimal TQD, we implemented each dynamics evolving under a
phase damping channel described by the non-unitary contribution given in
Eq. ( 148 ).

In the experiment we consider a constant dephasing rate as where @xmath
KHz is the dephasing rate and a linear interpolation for the function
@xmath (where we get a time-independent optimal TQD Hamiltonian), with
@xmath . Therefore, we have @xmath , where we pick the detuning
parameter @xmath as @xmath KHz. As previously, here we quantify the
robustness of the protocols from the fidelity defined in Eq. ( 165 ).
However, since we have a pure state as our target state @xmath , it is
possible to proof that the Eq. ( 165 ) becomes [ 150 ]

  -- -- -- -------
           (251)
  -- -- -- -------

with @xmath being solution of Schrödinger equation, obtained by
numerical calculations, and @xmath given by Eq. ( 243a ). The result for
the fidelity @xmath as a function of @xmath for both free-decohering and
decohering dynamics are shown in Fig. 13 b .

The continuum lines, with full symbols denoting the associated
experimental data, in Fig. 13 b denotes the values of @xmath under a
unitary dynamics for each protocol and the corresponding experimental
data points. This is possible because the the maximum total evolution
time is @xmath ms, while the coherence time is of order of @xmath ms for
the qubit used here. As expected, the black curve shows that the
adiabatic behavior is achieved for long total evolution time @xmath ms,
with @xmath computed from @xmath , where @xmath is the gap between
fundamental @xmath and excited @xmath energy levels [ 21 ] . It is
important highlight here that, for fast evolutions ( @xmath ), both
optimal and traditional TQD provide a high fidelity protocol, while
adiabatic dynamics fails. Naturally, this high performance is
accompanied by costly fields used for implementing the TQD protocols, as
previously shown in Fig. 13 b . On the other hand, it is important to
highlight that for total evolution time @xmath , where the optimal TQD
field is smaller than both adiabatic and traditional TQD ones, the high
performance of optimal TQD is kept.

By looking now at the effect of the dephasing channel (dashed curves,
with empty symbols denoting their respective experimental data) from
Fig. 13 , we can see that optimal TQD exhibits the highest robustness
for every @xmath , with its advantage increasing as @xmath increases.
For fast evolution times, this high performance is again associated with
costly fields in comparison with the adiabatic fields. However, for
large evolution times, while the traditional TQD fidelity converges to
adiabatic fidelity (as expected, because the counter-diabatic
Hamiltonian becomes less effective than the adiabatic one [ 33 ] ), the
fidelity behavior of optimal TQD is much better than both adiabatic
dynamics and traditional TQD, with less energy resources spent in the
process. This is a remarkable result, since we can achieve both better
fidelities with less energy fields involved. Table 2 summarizes fidelity
and intensity fields for the TQD models considered here. We highlight
that @xmath and there is a range of @xmath , where we get @xmath even
when @xmath . In conclusion, the generalized TQD approach allows us for
getting, at least to this case, time-independent TQD Hamiltoniansthat
are more robust and less energetically costing than its adiabatic and
standard counterparts.

### 14 Generalized TQD for a single-spin in a rotating magnetic field

As a second application, we study optimal transitionless evolution of a
single spin- @xmath particle in presence of a rotating magnetic field [
72 ] , whose Hamiltonian @xmath is given by the Eq. ( 34 ). Here we do
not assume any restriction on the parameters @xmath and @xmath , as done
previously. As we know, the set of eigenvectors for is given in Eqs. (
35 ), then one can show that the generalized TQD Hamiltonian reads

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (252)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath , with @xmath and @xmath being the generalized
quantal phases (arbitrary). Thus, note that a transitionless quantum
driving is not obtained by changing the angular frequency of the RF
field, but rather by changing the intensity of the magnetic fields. In
fact, as in Hamiltonian @xmath , we can write the magnetic field @xmath
associated with the Hamiltonian @xmath as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (253)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is associated with the free parameter @xmath and @xmath .
Therefore, the generalized transitionless theory allows us to use the
phases @xmath ( @xmath ) to minimize the magnetic field required to
implement the desired dynamics. In some cases, such a field is fixed and
no free parameter can be used to optimize the field intensity. For
example, if we set the parameters @xmath in order to obtain the exact
adiabatic dynamics with adiabatic phases @xmath , we find the standard
shortcut to adiabaticity, which is provided by the Hamiltonian in Eq. (
234 ), with the counter-diabatic term @xmath reading

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (254)
  -- -------- -- -------

leading to the standard quantum driving Hamiltonian in the form @xmath ,
with the magnetic field @xmath to implement @xmath reading

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (255)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the additional magnetic field. By analyzing the energy
resources to implement the desired evolution, we can find the optimal
protocol for the transitionless dynamics in terms of the magnetic field
intensities required by the Hamiltonian. In particular, it is possible
to show that the optimal field is obtained by setting @xmath , as
established in Theorem \thechapter .1 . Therefore, the optimal
transitionless counterpart reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (256)
  -- -------- -- -------

that can be written as @xmath with the optimal magnetic @xmath
identified as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (257)
  -- -------- -- -------

We can see that the norms of the fields satisfy @xmath and @xmath for
any choice of the set of parameters @xmath . This means that a fast
evolution based on the standard shortcut exactly mimicking the adiabatic
phase, such as given by Eq. ( 234 ), always requires more energy
resources than the original adiabatic dynamics. On the other hand, the
relation between @xmath and @xmath depends on the parameters @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath used in @xmath . In particular, this means that the
optimal shortcut to adiabaticity, such as given by Eq. ( 256 ), can be
faster while spending even less resources than the original adiabatic
dynamics. More specifically, this trade-off can be expressed through the
norm relation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (258)
  -- -------- -- -------

As we can see, for the case @xmath , we get @xmath . This shows the
advantage of the optimal TQD approach in comparison with its adiabatic
counterpart, whose implementation requires a higher magnetic field. It
is worth mentioning that, since the experimental implementation of the
driven Hamiltonian in NMR is obtained in the rotating frame, the
dynamics here is implemented by a phase modulated pulse with constant
amplitude applied off resonance. This approach is similar to the
adiabatic pulse technique where large swept-frequency offsets are used
to make the effective magnetic field, observed in the rotating frame,
approximately collinear with the spin magnetization [ 151 ] . In our
experiment no swept-frequency has been used. The energy cost is well
defined from the transverse RF field used to drive the system, since the
@xmath component of the Hamiltonian is implemented by a frequency shift,
with no real cost associated with it.

#### 14.1 Experimental implementation

In order to demonstrate the advantage of the TQD approach as a tool in
quantum control, we have performed an experimental realization using a
two-qubit NMR system, namely, the @xmath H and @xmath C spin @xmath
nuclei in the Chloroform molecule, with up and down spin states denoted
by @xmath and @xmath , respectively [ 152 ] . The experiment has been
realized at room temperature in a Varian 500 MHz spectrometer. More
specifically, we have compared the dynamics of the system driven by
fields @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . Since we need a single qubit, the
@xmath H spin has been driven by phase modulated magnetic fields, while
the @xmath C spin has been decoupled during the experiment. In the
rotating frame, the Hamiltonian associated with the magnetic pulse is
written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (259)
  -- -------- -- -------

By changing the amplitude of the pulses, the offset frequency and using
time phase modulation, one can reproduce the desired dynamics. The
evolution has been implemented in an on-resonance condition @xmath Hz.
This means that, even though the evolution obeys the adiabatic
condition, it can lead to population transfer, resulting in a violation
of the expected adiabatic evolution as a resonance effect [ 52 ] . From
the values set for @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , Eq. ( 258 ) implies that
@xmath , so that @xmath . Notice that the optimal TQD indeed spends less
energy resources as measured by the strength of the magnetic field
applied. The system is then initially prepared in the ground state of
@xmath , given by @xmath , and evolved according to the desired
Hamiltonian. The quantum state experimentally obtained is determined via
quantum state tomography [ 153 ] and compared to the theoretically
evaluated instantaneous ground state of @xmath . This is performed by
computing the fidelity @xmath between the instantaneous ground state of
@xmath , represented by the density operator @xmath , and the
dynamically evolved quantum state driven by the Hamiltonians @xmath ,
@xmath , and @xmath , represented by the density operator @xmath . The
fidelity @xmath is defined here as the relative purity given by [ 154 ,
155 , 156 ]

  -- -- -- -------
           (260)
  -- -- -- -------

The theoretical and experimental results are shown in Fig. 14 for the
three distinct dynamics. Since the experiment is performed on-resonance,
the evolution driven by the Hamiltonian @xmath is found to be
nonadiabatic, oscillating as a function of time. On the other hand, the
shortcuts given by @xmath , and @xmath keep a non-transitional
evolution, being immune to the resonance effect.

The fitting of the experimental data has been performed in an open
quantum system scenario, which is accomplished by adjusting the
parameters of the Lindblad equation whose non-unitary contribution is
given by Eq. ( 144 ). The NMR system considered in this work is mainly
affected by dephasing, which occurs due to the inhomogeneity of the
static magnetic field. This variation causes the spins of all the
molecules to slowly desynchronize and, therefore, lose coherence across
the sample. In this case, we have a single Lindblad operator @xmath ,
where the decohering rate @xmath is given by @xmath , with @xmath
denoting the dephasing relaxation time of the system. Other non-unitary
effects, such as generalized amplitude damping characterized by a
relaxation scale @xmath , are also present, but they are negligible for
the time ranges considered in the experiment. Indeed, in our
realization, we have @xmath s and @xmath s. Notice then that @xmath is
two orders of magnitude larger than the total time of evolution, so that
generalized amplitude damping does not exhibit significant effect.
Hence, by considering dephasing as a main effect, the non-unitary part
of the dynamics is dictated by the Eq. ( 148 ). As we showed previously,
due to the resonance configuration [ 52 , 61 ] , the adiabatic dynamics
for @xmath does not hold in general, being achieved just for some
particular instants of time. Notice that the oscillation in the
adiabatic fidelity is damped as a function of time. This is a by-product
of dephasing in the system. Moreover, there are also errors induced by
the implementation of RF pulses. Those errors are about @xmath per
pulse. Remarkably, shortcuts to adiabaticity show considerable
robustness against the decoherence and unitary errors.

As shown in Fig. 14 , fidelity stays close to one throughout the
evolution, which means that the states of the evolution are, indeed,
kept as instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath . Therefore, as expected,
the adiabatic behavior of the system is drastically affected by the
resonance phenomenon. On the other hand, the standard TQD and the
optimal TQD are both immune to the resonance destructive effect. In
particular, we have shown that the optimal TQD approach provides a
transitionless Hamiltonian that can be implemented with low intensity
fields in comparison with the fields used to implement the adiabatic and
the standard TQD Hamiltonians.

### 15 Quantum gates by Controlled TQD

In this section we show a useful application of TQD, namely application
to quantum information processing, where we use TQD as a shortcuts to
adiabaticity to speed up adiabatic quantum gates. More specifically, it
has been applied to perform universal quantum computation (QC) via
either counter-diabatic controlled evolutions [ 10 ] or counter-diabatic
quantum teleportation [ 32 ] . As hybrid models, these approaches
provide a convenient digital architecture for physical realizations
while potentially keeping both the generality and some inherently
robustness of analog implementations. Experimentally, digitized
implementations of quantum annealing processes have been recently
provided [ 8 ] , with controlled quantum gates adiabatically realized
with high fidelity via superconducting qubits [ 157 ] . In this Section,
by focusing on controlled evolutions, we will now show that
counter-diabatic QC can be more robust against decoherence than its
adiabatic counterpart as long as the gate runtime is suitably determined
within a range of evolution times.

#### 15.1 Quantum gates by adiabatic controlled evolutions

In adiabatic protocols, we need to start the evolution at some
eigenstate of the Hamiltonian @xmath , and at the end of the evolution (
@xmath ) we should get the respective updated eigenstate of @xmath . A
important point to highlight here is that the input state of the
computation should not depend on the @xmath , and vice-versa. It is a
strong requirement because we want to design a universal model of
computation, so the input state needs to be considered as an unknown
state . To this end, we consider a bipartite system composed by a target
subsystem @xmath and an auxiliary subsystem @xmath , whose individual
Hilbert spaces @xmath and @xmath have dimensions @xmath and @xmath ,
respectively. The auxiliary subsystem @xmath will be driven by a family
of time-dependent Hamiltonians @xmath , with @xmath . The target
subsystem will be driven by a complete set @xmath of orthogonal
projectors over @xmath , which satisfy @xmath and @xmath . In a
controlled adiabatic dynamics, the composite system @xmath will be
governed by a Hamiltonian in the form [ 9 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (261)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath , where @xmath is the beginning Hamiltonian, @xmath is the
contribution @xmath to the final Hamiltonian, and the time-dependent
functions @xmath and @xmath satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath and
@xmath .

Now, we prepare @xmath in the initial state @xmath , where @xmath is an
arbitrary state of @xmath and @xmath is the ground state of @xmath .
Then @xmath is the ground state of the initial Hamiltonian @xmath . By
applying the adiabatic theorem [ 3 , 21 ] , a sufficiently
slowing-varying evolution of @xmath will drive the system (up to a
phase) to the final state

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (262)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the ground state of @xmath [ 9 ] . Note that an
arbitrary projection @xmath over the unknown state @xmath can be yielded
by performing a convenient measurement over @xmath . Therefore, by
adjusting the set of projectors @xmath and the Hamiltonians @xmath , it
is possible to control the output state @xmath of @xmath , so that
single and @xmath -qubit gates can be implemented [ 10 ] . In fact,

Let us begin by considering @xmath as a single qubit and a single-qubit
gate as an arbitrary rotation of angle @xmath around a direction @xmath
over the Bloch sphere. Under this consideration, the Hamiltonian that
adiabatically implements such a single-qubit gate for an arbitrary input
state @xmath , with @xmath , is given by [ 9 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (263)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a complete set of orthogonal projectors over the Hilbert
space of the target qubit. The projectors can be parametrized as @xmath
, with @xmath associated with the direction of the target qubit on the
Bloch sphere. In Eq. ( 263 ), each Hamiltonian @xmath ( @xmath ) acts on
@xmath , and is given by [ 9 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (264)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath denoting an arbitrary parameter that sets the success
probability of obtaining the desired state at the end of the evolution.
This parameter plays a role in the energy performance of
counter-diabatic QC, with probabilistic counter-diabatic QC ( @xmath )
being energetically more favorable than its deterministic ( @xmath )
counterpart [ 33 ] .

The projectors @xmath may be written in terms of two basis vectors
@xmath in the Bloch sphere as @xmath , where

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (265)
     @xmath   @xmath      (266)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Thus, a quantum gate is encoded as a rotation of @xmath around the
vector @xmath (as we shall illustrate in Fig. 15 a ). Now, by expressing
the state @xmath in the basis @xmath , we write @xmath , with @xmath
being a state in the direction @xmath and @xmath . We then prepare the
system in the initial state @xmath . Then, assuming an adiabatic
dynamics, the evolved state @xmath is given by the superposition

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (267)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath being the rotated desired state and the ground @xmath and
first excited @xmath states of @xmath given by

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (268)
     @xmath   @xmath      (269)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

We observe that, due to the dynamics of the auxiliary qubit through two
adiabatic paths, there are quantum (adiabatic) phases @xmath and @xmath
accompanying the evolutions associated with @xmath and @xmath ,
respectively. Then, relative phases should in principle be considered in
Eq. ( 267 ). However, as shown in the Ref. [ 9 ] , such phases satisfy
@xmath . Thus, they factorize as a global phase of the state @xmath . At
the end of the evolution, a measurement on the auxiliary qubit yields
the rotated state with probability @xmath and the input state with
probability @xmath . The computation process is therefore probabilistic
, which succeeds if the auxiliary qubit ends up in the state @xmath .
Otherwise, the target system automatically returns to the input state
and we simply restart the protocol. In the adiabatic scenario, the
parameter @xmath can then be adjusted in order to obtain the optimal
fidelity @xmath by taking the limit @xmath , implying in a deterministic
computation.

This model can be easily adapted to implement controlled single-qubit
gates (two-qubit gates). To this end, the target system has to be
increased from one qubit to two qubits, where one of these qubits will
be used as control and the second one as target. Again, we need to
consider the auxiliary qubit in order to provide the universality of the
protocol. Here, we adopt that the single-qubit gate acts on the target
register if the state of the control register is @xmath . With this
convention, the Hamiltonian that implements a controlled single-qubit
gate is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (270)
  -- -------- -- -------

where now the set the orthogonal projectors is given by @xmath , where
@xmath denotes the computational basis. The input state of the target
system is now written as @xmath , with @xmath and @xmath denoting the
control and target register, respectively. By rewriting @xmath in terms
of the basis @xmath , we have @xmath , with @xmath . Therefore, by
assuming adiabatic evolution, the system evolves from the state @xmath ,
to the instantaneous state

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (271)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

with @xmath being the rotated desired state. We then see that the final
state @xmath allows for a probabilistic interpretation for the evolution
and, consequently, the computation protocol can again be taken as
probabilistic ( @xmath ) or deterministic ( @xmath ).

#### 15.2 Quantum gates by standard and optimal TQD controlled
evolutions

As shown in Ref. [ 10 ] , the standard TQD Hamiltonian that implements
the shortcut to controlled adiabatic evolutions reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (272)
  -- -------- -- -------

where each Hamiltonian @xmath is the corresponding standard TQD
Hamiltonian associated with the Hamiltonian @xmath given in Eq. ( 261 ).
Thus, we write @xmath , with @xmath the corresponding counter-diabatic
term of @xmath . For the single and two-qubit gates previously
discussed, the counter-diabatic Hamiltonians @xmath associated with the
Hamiltonians @xmath in Eq. ( 264 ) are time-independent and given by (
@xmath )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (273)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, one note that the cost of performing standard TQD requires
the knowledge of the eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath . Moreover,
we can show that, for an arbitrary @xmath -controlled quantum gate, we
get time-independent counter-diabatic Hamiltonians [ 10 ] . Therefore,
the Eq. ( 273 ) shows that the implementation of the shortcut can be
achieved with a very simple assistant Hamiltonian in the quantum
dynamics. Then, the standard TQD Hamiltonian that implements a
single-qubit gate reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (274)
  -- -------- -- -------

with

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (275)
  -- -------- -- -------

Similarly, we derive a general TQD Hamiltonian in which the quantal
phases are considered as arbitrary. Remarkably, the Hamiltonian satisfy
the conditions of the Theorem \thechapter .2 and the parallel transport
condition. Therefore, the optimal TQD reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (276)
  -- -------- -- -------

in which each optimal Hamiltonian @xmath is given by @xmath . Thus, the
application of generalized TQD theory to quantum computation allows us
to get a optimal costing time-independent TQD Hamiltonian @xmath given
by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (277)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is given by the Eq. ( 273 ). To end, by using the same
discussion as above, the complete set of TQD Hamiltonian to be used as
to achieve an universal scheme of quantum computation is obtained as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (278)
     @xmath   @xmath      (279)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

with the projector @xmath defined as in Eq. ( 270 ), and the
Hamiltonians @xmath and @xmath given as in Eqs. ( 273 ) and ( 275 ),
respectively.

As a important remark, it is evident that a number of strategies can be
used to implement quantum gates. For example, inverse engineering of a
Hamiltonian is an interesting strategy to design a class of Hamiltonians
to quantum computation [ 31 ] , where it is shown how arbitrary single
and controlled quantum gates are implementable through very simple
time-independent Hamiltonians, and to speed up state engineering [ 158 ]
, as well. Here we are using a different approach to achieve the same
result as in Refs. [ 31 , 158 ] . However, among the infinite curves
connecting the input to the output state, here we are interested in that
dynamics where the path followed by the system in the Hilbert space is
the adiabatic path. For this reason, these number of additional controls
(and fields), auxiliary qubits and measurements (sometimes) are
required.

The performance of optimal TQD approach in comparative with its
adiabatic and standard counterpart is studied in Ref. [ 71 ] , where
different scenarios of energy resource and decohering effects were
considered. As main result, in any case of decoherence and energetic
resource, there always exist dynamical regimes (short evolution times)
for which the optimal transitionless evolutions are more robust and
therefore a preferred approach in a decohering physical environment.
This has been shown for both the dephasing and GAD channels acting on
the eigenstate bases. It is also possible to show the advantage in other
bases, such as the computational basis. The general picture is that the
gain will typically occur during some finite time range, disappearing in
the limit of long evolution times. These results are encouraging for the
generalized transitionless approach in the open-system realm as long as
local Hamiltonians are possible to be designed. In the specific case of
quantum gate Hamiltonians, this approach can be applied, e.g. to derive
robust local building blocks for analog implementations of quantum
circuits (see, e.g., Refs. [ 157 , 8 ] ).

#### 15.3 Optimal TQD quantum computation in NMR experimental setup

The experimental realization of quantum gates is implemented through the
Chloroform molecule by taking the @xmath C nucleus as the target qubit
and the @xmath H nucleus as the auxiliary subsystem. In our experiment [
72 ] , we encode the computational states @xmath and @xmath into the
spin states @xmath and @xmath , respectively. The schematic
representation of the quantum dynamics is illustrated in Fig. 15 b ,
where the composite system is initially prepared at @xmath and measured
in @xmath . The decohering time scales in our system are @xmath s and
@xmath s for @xmath C nucleus and @xmath s and @xmath s for @xmath H
nucleus.

We have considered the experimental implementation of the single-qubit
phase gate @xmath , which yields the Pauli matrix @xmath applied to the
input qubit, which is prepared in an arbitrary initial state along a
direction @xmath in the Bloch sphere. To this gate, the adiabatic,
standard TQD, and optimal TQD Hamiltonians are given by (the subscript
“C” and “H” denotes operation on Carbon and Hydrogen nucleus,
respectively)

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
                          
     @xmath   @xmath      (280a)
     @xmath   @xmath      (280b)
     @xmath   @xmath      (280c)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

which are obtained from Eqs. ( 270 ), ( 274 ), and ( 277 ),
respectively, with @xmath and @xmath denoting a real frequency in the
experiment. It is worth highlighting that a study on the energy cost to
implement adiabatic and TQD Hamiltonians has been previously discussed
in Ref. [ 71 ] from an operator norm approach. Here, we are interested
in analyzing the cost from an alternative point of view, where we
associate fixed energy amounts for each pulse in a pulse sequence.
Therefore, this includes the effective energy spent to implement each
pulse of magnetic field, while disregarding the free evolution
contributions to the quantum dynamics.

Particularly, in our experimental implementation of the phase gate
@xmath , we have set @xmath Hz. We can see that, differently from the
standard TQD and adiabatic Hamiltonians, the optimal TQD protocol
provides a time-independent Hamiltonian to realize the phase gate @xmath
. In Fig. 16 a , we present the pulse sequences used to implement each
Hamiltonian in Eqs. ( 280 ) for any input state. As an illustration, the
initial state of the target qubit considered in our experiment has been
taken as @xmath , with @xmath . Each pulse sequence implements the
correct dynamics up to a rotation around the @xmath -axis over the
auxiliary qubit. Since the final state of the auxiliary qubit is @xmath
, the circuits provide the correct output up to a global phase. The
pulse composition is described in details in Appendix E.1 .

The Hamiltonians in Eq. ( 280a ) and ( 280b ) are time-dependent and do
not commute at different instants of time, i.e. @xmath and @xmath for
some @xmath . Then, their pulse sequences are required to implement the
Dyson series for the corresponding unitaries [ 150 ] . Thus, as shown in
Figs. 16 a -I and 16 a -II, the @xmath repetitions are associated to
a“trotterization” of the Dyson series for the adiabatic and standard TQD
protocols, respectively, with the implementation of the Dyson series
being exact in the limit @xmath . The repeated application of the
sequence can lead to the accumilation to experimental sistematic errors,
in order to avoid the rrors we have employed NMR composite pulses [ 159
] . On the other hand, the optimal TQD Hamiltonian @xmath can be
implemented by using a very short pulse sequence, as shown in Fig 16 a
-III.

An immediate discussion arising from the analysis above is the amount of
energy required to implement the protocol (the pulse sequence associated
with the Dyson series). In order to conveniently study the energy cost
of implementing the optimal TQD protocol, we need to analyze the energy
cost of implementing the sequence of pulses able to reproduce the Dyson
series for each dynamics. Consequently, from the pulse sequence
presented in Fig 16 a , the energy cost evolving the optimal TQD is (at
least) @xmath times less than both that associated with the adiabatic
and the standard TQD protocols. In fact, if we consider that each pulse
in Fig. 16 a [given by a rotation @xmath ] is associated with an energy
cost @xmath , the overall energy cost for implementing the optimal TQD
is @xmath (disregarding the energy cost of free evolutions), while the
energy cost of the adiabatic and the standard TQD are given by @xmath
and @xmath , respectively. From this analysis, it follows that
generalized TQD can be used to provide Hamiltonians exhibiting optimal
pulse sequence.

We also consider the @xmath between the instantaneous ground state of
@xmath and the dynamically evolved quantum states driven by the
Hamiltonians @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath . This is shown in Fig. 16 b .
Notice that, as expected for the Hamiltonian @xmath , the fidelity
improves as the evolution time is increased. In contrast, @xmath and
@xmath are capable of achieving high fidelities for any evolution time,
since they are designed to mimic the adiabatic evolution for arbitrary
@xmath . Notice also that, for the time scale considered in the
experiment, which goes up to @xmath ms, decoherence has little effect,
since this @xmath is still much smaller than the dephasing relaxation
time scale @xmath .

### 16 Conclusions of this chapter

In this chapter we have developed a generalized minimal resource
demanding counter-diabatic theory, which is able to yield efficient
shortcuts to adiabaticity via fast transitionless evolutions. To this
end, we explore the gauge freedom of the quantal phases that accompany
the evolution dynamics, so that we can fix them in order to minimize
some physical quantity of our interest. In particular, we have focused
on minimum energy and pulse costs for implement a optimal TQD, comparing
it with its associated adiabatic dynamics and traditional TQD
counterparts. The performance of the theory has been experimentally
investigated in two different experimental setups. Firstly, by using the
trapped Ytterbium ion qubit the result are: i) The optimal version of
generalized TQD has been shown to be a useful protocol for obtaining the
optimal shortcut to adiabaticity. While adiabatic and traditional TQD
require time-dependent quantum control, optimal TQD can be
experimentally realized by using time-independent fields. In addition,
the necessity of auxiliary fields in traditional TQD is not a
requirement for implementing TQD via its optimal version. ii) Optimal
TQD is an energetically optimal protocol of shortcut to adiabaticity. By
considering the average intensity fields as a measure of energy cost for
implementing the protocols discussed here, we were able to show that the
optimal version of generalized TQD may be energetically less demanding.
This result is kept also for alternatives definitions of energy cost,
e.g. taking into account the detuning contribution. iii) By simulating
an environment-system coupling associated with the dephasing channel, we
have shown that optimal TQD can be more robust than the adiabatic
dynamics and the traditional TQD while at the same time spending less
energy resources for a finite time range. Once the Landau-Zener
Hamiltonian can be implemented in other physical systems, e.g. nuclear
magnetic resonance [ 150 ] and two-level systems driven by a chirped
field [ 26 ] , it is reasonable to think that the results obtained here
can be also realized in other experimental architectures.

As a second experimental verification, we investigated the generalized
approach for TQD in an NMR setup. As a first application in this
architecture, we considered the adiabatic dynamics of a single spin
@xmath particle in a resonant time-dependent rotating magnetic field. As
expected, the adiabatic behavior of the system is drastically affected
by the resonance phenomenon. On the other hand, the standard TQD and the
optimal TQD are both immune to the resonance destructive effect. In
particular, we have shown that the optimal TQD approach provides a
transitionless Hamiltonian that can be implemented with low intensity
fields in comparison with the fields used to implement the adiabatic and
the standard TQD Hamiltonians. The second application was done through
the study of the adiabatic and counter-diabatic implementations of
single-qubit quantum gates in NMR. From the generalized approach for
TQD, we have addressed the problem of the feasibility of the shortcuts
to adiabaticity, as provided by TQD protocols, in the context of quantum
computation via controlled evolutions [ 9 , 10 ] . By using the
generalized TQD Hamiltonian [ 71 ] , we have presented the optimal
solution in terms of pulse sequence and resources to implement fast
quantum gates through counter-diabatic quantum computation with high
fidelity. The energy-optimal protocol presented here is potentially
useful for speeding up digitized adiabatic quantum computing [ 73 ] .
Our study explicitly illustrates the performance of generalized TQD in
terms of both energy resources and optimal pulse sequence. Since
digitized adiabatic quantum computing requires the Trotterization of the
adiabatic dynamics, our protocol could be useful in reducing the number
of steps used in digital adiabatic quantum processes. In addition, such
process is independent of the experimental approach used to digitize the
adiabatic quantum evolution.

These results are encouraging for the generalized transitionless
approach in the open-system realm as long as local Hamiltonians are
possible to be designed. In the specific case of quantum gate
Hamiltonians, this approach can be applied, e.g. to derive robust local
building blocks for analog implementations of quantum circuits (see,
e.g., Refs. [ 157 , 8 ] ).

## Chapter \thechapter Overview and future perspectives \lettrine

[lines=3,lhang=0.33,nindent=0em] I n this thesis we presented general
results on adiabatic dynamics in closed and open systems, and shortcuts
to adiabaticity by transitionless quantum driving. In the context of
adiabatic dynamics in closed system we presented potentially useful
theorems that can be viewed as a validation mechanism for the well-known
adiabaticity conditions, where changes of frame in Schrödinger equation
are required. In particular, for the closed system case, we have both
theoretically and experimentally shown that several relevant ACs, which
include the traditional AC, are neither sufficient nor necessary to
describe the adiabatic behavior of a qubit in an oscillating field
considered here. This result leads us to the conclusion that we do not
typically have a fully applicable AC. However, from an adequate choice
of the reference frame used to describe the system dynamics, sufficiency
and necessity of the ACs are fundamentally obtained under certain
conditions through the non-inertial frame map. As a potential
application of adiabatic dynamics, we provided a way to enhance the
charging performance of quantum devices able to store energy (quantum
batteries). We propose the notion of adiabatic QBs , where the adiabatic
behavior takes place in the non-inertial frame and it allows for a
stable charging process of the battery, since in inertial frame the
dynamics is not adiabatic. To this aim, we propose the notion of a new
quantum observable that quantifies the energy transfer rate from the
quantum battery to a consumption hub, the power operator. Applications
of this operator have demonstrated its usefulness in quantum battery
context. For open systems, our theoretical results give complementary
contributions to the results known in the literature. The validity
conditions used to predict the adiabatic behavior of a quantum system
evolving through non-unitary dynamics are reviewed. We have shown that
the adiabatic approximation for open systems holds in the asymptotic
time limit @xmath as an arbitrarily valid consequence of the
one-dimensional Jordan decomposition of the Lindblad superoperator, the
absence of level crossings, and the initialization of the system as a
superposition of only two eigenstates of Lindbladian that drives the
system. Our main result in adiabaticity in open system refers to the
application in quantum thermodynamics, where we can provide some
enhanced understanding on the thermal adiabatic process and dynamical
adiabatic evolutions. To end, as an original contribution to the TQD
theory, we have developed a generalized minimal energy demanding
counter-diabatic theory, which is able to yield efficient shortcuts to
adiabaticity via fast transitionless evolutions. Moreover, we have
investigated the robustness of adiabatic dynamics, standard and optimal
TQD under decoherence. There always exist dynamical regimes for which
generalized transitionless evolutions are more robust and therefore a
preferred approach in a decohering setup.

### Future perspectives

As future perspectives, there are a number of open questions to be
addressed.

1) The study introduced here on adiabatic dynamics allows us to realize
further future research as detailed below.

1-a) The consideration and influence of different reference frames in
the adiabatic dynamics of the system lead us to the fundamental question
of the existence of a preferable non-inertial frame. In addition, our
development takes into account a single resonant field acting on the
system, so that a more general approach for an arbitrary number of
fields is an open question.

1-b) The experimental implementation of the two-cell adiabatic quantum
battery proposed here is a desired task to be taken in consideration as
future research. The charging and discharging process of the quantum
battery proposed in this thesis will be investigated in a transmon qubit
superconducting system in collaboration with experimental groups. The
questions to be experimentally addressed here refers to stable
charging/discharging of quantum batteries based on Bell states and its
robustness against decohering effects.

1-c) When we use the terminology “quantum” in quantum devices, it is
required some detailed discussion on what quantum is in such devices.
For example, the quantum advantage of quantum batteries may be
associated with quantum entanglement [ 86 , 87 , 88 , 89 , 90 ] and it
becomes evident in multi-cell quantum batteries. Therefore, the
scalability of the model proposed here is of great interest, where we
can verify the real role of entanglement for the power of the
charging/discharging process of the battery. Moreover, since the
experimental verification of the expected quantum advantage has not been
addressed so far, collaboration with experimental groups will be
considered in future research.

2) As for the generalized TQD theory, we investigated its performance in
minimizing the energy cost of fast evolutions, and the pulse sequence
required to implement optimal TQD. However, we can think about a number
of applications that can be benefited from these particular evolutions.
For example, applications of generalized TQD to holonomic quantum
computing [ 160 ] , superadiabatic charging of quantum batteries through
minimal intensity fields [ 62 , 63 ] and optimal superadiabatic quantum
thermal engines [ 46 , 161 ] .

2-a) In the general theory of optimal control [ 162 ] , one studies how
to find a set of fields @xmath (pulses, for example) that drives the
system along a path @xmath in such way that we can maximize the quantity
@xmath , for some predefined observable @xmath [ 163 ] . Then, how can
we use the generalized approach of TQD in a general approach of optimal
control? What is the general formalism to find optimal quantal phases
from an arbitrary observable @xmath ?

2-b) The standard TQD has been applied to enhance performance of quantum
thermal engines concerning the adiabatic version of such heat engines [
46 , 161 , 164 ] . However, an open question here is whether this
enhancement is due to the additional fields which acts on the system. As
future research we will address this question by using the generalized
TQD and providing a scenario where TQD and adiabatic dynamics spend a
same amount of energy. Moreover, it is known that if we speed up a
thermodynamics cycle in order to enhance the power, some amount of
energy is thrown away as a dissipated work due to diabatic transitions [
165 , 166 ] . In particular, it was shown that shortcuts to adiabaticity
can be a good strategy to deal with this problem [ 34 ] . The open
question is whether there is some optimal TQD Hamiltonian able to
minimize undesired entropy production along some superadiabatic thermal
cycle.

2-c) Given the notion of adiabatic quantum battery and the role of TQD
in quantum thermodynamic tasks, the proposal of superadiabatic quantum
batteries based on TQD is an exciting possibility. Although the
adiabatic version of such devices allows for a stable charging process,
the average power is limited by the total evolution time imposed by the
adiabatic theorem. Then, standard and generalized TQD positively
contribute to design a high power and stable energy transference
process.

2-d) The extension for open systems of the standard version of TQD, as
proposed by Demirplak and Rice, was proposed by Vacanti et al [ 167 ] .
However, different from closed system TQD, the open system TQD requires
our ability of controlling both fields and decohering environment to
drive the system along of an open system adiabatic path. Therefore, the
extension of the generalized approach of TQD for open system is highly
desirable as topic for future research.

## Chapter \thechapter Change of frame in quantum mechanics \lettrine

[lines=3,lhang=0.33,nindent=0em] H ere we present the calculations
related with a change of frame in quantum mechanics, where we explore
resonance phenomena and present auxiliary calculations on the validity
conditions of adiabaticity from different reference frame
representations.

## Appendix A Spin 1/2 particle in a rotating magnetic field

Let us start from below Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (281)
  -- -------- -- -------

which describes the spin- @xmath particle in presence of a rotating
magnetic field. The above dynamics is considered concerning the
laboratory inertial frame. In such frame, the unitary system dynamics is
governed by Von Neumann’s equation given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (282)
  -- -------- -- -------

Due the oscillatory behavior of the transverse field, it is convenient
to rewrite the system dynamics in rotating frame provided by the
time-dependent unitary transformation @xmath . By doing that, we can
implement a rotation in above equation as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (283)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we can define the system rotated state as @xmath , so that

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (284)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

in which we can use @xmath to get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (285)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus, we have

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (286)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

and we conclude that the dynamics of the system in rotating frame will
be given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (287)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the new Hamiltonian in rotating frame is @xmath . By computing the
new Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (288)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

now we can use that

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (289)
     @xmath   @xmath      (290)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

to get the time-independent Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (291)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Thus, the solution of the dynamics in rotating frame reads as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (292)
  -- -------- -- -------

so that in non-rotating one we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (293)
  -- -------- -- -------

## Appendix B Resonance in a two-level system driven by oscillating
field

Let us consider a Landau-Zener type Hamiltonian given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (294)
  -- -------- -- -------

We can rewrite Eq. ( 294 ) as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (295)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . It is not obvious that the Hamiltonian @xmath in Eq. (
295 ) exhibits a resonant behavior. In order to see this fact, let us
define an time-dependent oscillating frame @xmath . In this oscillating
frame, the Hamiltonian is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (296)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath and @xmath .

## Appendix C Proof of the theorems

Let us consider two Hamiltonians, an inertial frame Hamiltonian @xmath
and its non-inertial counterpart @xmath , which are related by a
time-dependent unitary @xmath . The dynamics associated with
Hamiltonians @xmath and @xmath are given by

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (297)
     @xmath   @xmath      (298)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath . Then, the connection between the evolved
states @xmath and @xmath in inertial and non-inertial frames,
respectively, is given by @xmath , @xmath . By considering the initial
state in inertial frame given by a single eigenstate of @xmath , namely
@xmath , the adiabatic dynamics in this frame is written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (299)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the adiabatic phase composed by the dynamical and
geometrical phase, respectively. On the other hand, an adiabatic
behavior is obtained in non-inertial frame if and only if

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (300)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, we can write

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (301)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Thus, Eq. ( 301 ) establishes a necessary and sufficient condition to
obtain an adiabatic evolution in the non-inertial frame, assuming an
adiabatic evolution in the original frame. To conclude our proof, let us
consider the converse case, where the system starts in a eigenstate of
@xmath in non-inertial frame. If the dynamics is adiabatic we write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (302)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the adiabatic phase collected in this frame. The
dynamics will be adiabatic in the inertial frame if and only if

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (303)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, by using the same procedure as before, we get the condition

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (304)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

which is equivalent to Eq. ( 301 ). This ends the proof of the Theorem
\thechapter .1 . Now, let us proof the second theorem discussed in this
thesis.

To this end, we need to consider a time-independent Hamiltonian @xmath
in the non-inertial frame, so that its evolution operator can be written
as @xmath . Thus, we can write the dynamics in non-inertial frame as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (305)
  -- -------- -- -------

Moreover, assuming adiabatic dynamics in the inertial frame, we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (306)
  -- -------- -- -------

By using the relationship between inertial and non-inertial frames as
@xmath , we can write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (307)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have used the Eq. ( 305 ). Now, by taking @xmath , we obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (308)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus, by inserting the initial state @xmath in Eq. ( 308 ), we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (309)
  -- -------- -- -------

This concludes the proof of Theorem \thechapter .2 .

#### c.1 Application to the oscillating Hamiltonian

In order to show how the Theorem \thechapter .1 allows us to predict the
adiabatic behavior of the system driven by the Hamiltonian in Eq. ( 294
), let us first consider a generic system under action of a single
time-dependent oscillating field with characteristic frequency @xmath ,
whose Hamiltonian reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (310)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we consider the transverse term @xmath as a perturbation, so that
@xmath , @xmath . In this case, the eigenstates @xmath and energies
@xmath of @xmath can be obtained as perturbation of eigenstates @xmath
and energies @xmath of @xmath as (up to a normalization coefficient)

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (311)
     @xmath   @xmath      (312)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

On the other hand, in the non-inertial frame, we have @xmath , which
yields

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (313)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . Now, we separately consider two specific cases:

@xmath Far-from resonance situation @xmath : In this case, the term
@xmath in Eq. ( 313 ) works as a perturbation. Therefore the set of
eigenvectors of @xmath reads

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (314)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where we have used that the energy gaps @xmath of the Hamiltonian @xmath
are identical to energy gaps @xmath of @xmath and @xmath . Thus, from
Eqs. ( 311 ) and ( 314 ) we conclude, for any eigenstate @xmath , that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (315)
  -- -------- -- -------

so that we get @xmath , @xmath , @xmath .

@xmath Resonance situation @xmath : Now, we have a more subtle
situation. Firstly, we can use Eqs. ( 311 ) and ( 312 ) to write

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (316)
     @xmath   @xmath      (317)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

so that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (318)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now, it is possible to see that if @xmath , @xmath , then the theorem is
satisfied. By applying this results to the Hamiltonian in Eq. ( 296 ) we
can see that for @xmath we get @xmath and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (319)
  -- -------- -- -------

Since @xmath , with @xmath , we conclude that @xmath .

## Chapter \thechapter Experimental setup

## Appendix D The Ytterbium trapped ion experimental setup

In this section we present more details on the first system used to
experimentally study some theoretical results presented in this thesis.
In particular, we are interested here in providing a detailed discussion
about the main elements used in this thesis, so that the readers could
better understand our results. For a complete discussion, we indicate
the PhD thesis by Chang-Kang Hu [ 74 ] (thesis in Chinese, read it
moderately!).

#### d.1 Foundations of ion trapping and qubit initialization

In general, the trapping mechanism of neutral or charged particles is
dependent on the particle to be trapped, among many other factors, so
here we provide a discussion on the particular system used in this
thesis [ 74 ] . However, independent on the system, to trap a particle
(charged or not) we use electric and magnetic fields. A general result,
called Earnshaw’s theorem [ 168 ] , allows us to identify the minimum
requirement to trap a particle in a stable way, more specifically, a
charged particle cannot be held in a stable equilibrium by using static
fields. Even though very general, the demonstration of this result is
very simple and it immediately comes from the Gauss equations for
electric and magnetic static fields @xmath and @xmath . These equations
tell us that the electric/magnetic field flux going through a region
(volume @xmath ) is null, so a charged particle under action of this
field will undergoes a non-confining state.

It is reasonable to think about the trapping task for slow motion
particles (less energetic), otherwise we need strong fields to trap them
around a specific position. For atomic beam that comes from a heat gas,
we need to reduce the beam temperature by using a procedure called
Doppler cooling [ 169 , 170 ] . The Doppler cooling is a technique used
to slow down the motion of each atom by using a laser beam tuned
slightly below at the natural resonance frequency of the atom energy
level. In a Ytterbium ion @xmath Yb @xmath , the relevant energy levels
populated during the cooling procedure are shown in Fig. 17 [ 74 , 83 ]
. For the ion @xmath Yb @xmath the Doppler cooling is achieved through a
@xmath nm laser beam, where the cooling is obtained from the optical
transition cycle @xmath [ 83 ] . This cycle transition happens because
the system at state @xmath absorbs a photon and it becomes excited at
the state @xmath , then the atom spontaneously emits a photon in a
aleatory direction and uniformly probability distribution. In
particular, if the system decays to state the @xmath , the system remain
in cooling cycle. However, as shown in Fig. 17 , during the transition
cycle @xmath there is a branching ratio @xmath for population decay from
@xmath state to the @xmath , where the decay probability has been
theoretically studied in Ref. [ 171 ] , with experimentally verification
in Refs. [ 83 , 172 ] . In order to sent the system back to the cooling
cycle, a light at @xmath nm is used to promote transitions @xmath ,
where the system can quickly decay from @xmath to @xmath . Therefore, by
driving the system through a many cooling cycles process we can achieve
the cooling limit (minimal temperature). This limit is known as Doppler
cooling limit and given it predicts the minimal temperature @xmath ,
where @xmath is a characteristic parameter associated to system
(transition linewidth) and @xmath is the Boltzmann’s constant [ 173 ,
174 , 175 , 176 , 177 ] . For the Ytterbium ion @xmath Yb @xmath we have
@xmath MHz, so that we can find @xmath K. Thus, since we are interested
in applications in quantum information processing, after Doppler cooling
step a single ion is trapped by the radio frequency electric field.

After the cooling and trapping process, the qubit is initialized and
then can be manipulated in order to process quantum information. Our
qubit is encoded within energy subspace @xmath spanned by the states
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath , where @xmath denotes the total angular
momentum of the atom and @xmath is its projection along the quantization
axis. In absence of an external fields, the subspace @xmath is
degenerate. Therefore, when we apply an external static magnetic field
@xmath the Zeeman effect in order to highlight the hyperfine structure
splitting, so that an amount of energy @xmath separates the energy
eigenstates with @xmath , as shown in Fig. 2 . Thus, we identify
subspace of two states that can be used as a two-level system, i.e., as
our desired qubit. The Zeeman shift in transition frequency is given by
@xmath MHz/G and the transition frequency of the qubit reads as @xmath
GHz. It is important to mention that the frequency @xmath is smoothly
affected by the external magnetic field as @xmath , where @xmath Hz is
the second order Zeeman shift ( @xmath is the intensity of the static
magnetic field in Gauss) [ 74 ] . Thus, in the experiments considered in
this thesis, an additional shift about @xmath KHz is added. Therefore,
the qubit is encoded in states @xmath and @xmath , where the energy gap
reads as @xmath .

#### d.2 Trapped ion qubit dynamics

Given the natural configuration of the system and the set of states
spanned by @xmath and @xmath , with energies @xmath and @xmath ,
respectively, we can define the bare Hamiltonian for our qubit as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (320)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Pauli matrix. As schematically shown in Fig. 2 , by
using an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) we can manipulate the qubit
through a unitary dynamics by driving the system with an magnetic field
@xmath , one uses the dipole approximation to write the contribution of
this interaction to energy of the system as @xmath , where @xmath [ 124
, 178 ] . Here we use the subscript “un” to denote the field associated
with a unitary dynamics, later we shall see that the same AWG can be
used to design a non-unitary dynamics through a field @xmath .
Therefore, we find

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (321)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then, for simplicity we use that @xmath , so that the total Hamiltonian
@xmath reads as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (322)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we defined the Rabi frequency @xmath and the Pauli matrix @xmath .
Now, by using perturbation theory we can write the dynamical equation to
the coefficients @xmath and @xmath associated with the evolved state

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (323)
  -- -------- -- -------

In fact, by writing @xmath we get the dynamics for @xmath as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (324)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath . As a first remark, note that @xmath for any @xmath ,
therefore we can also write @xmath for any @xmath . This tells us that
the solution for the above equation reads as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (325)
  -- -------- -- -------

with

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (326)
  -- -------- -- -------

We use that

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (327)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . Therefore, by integrating the above expression

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (328)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Thus, for a highly oscillating external field, we can approximate the
above expression to

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (329)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

For this reason, in our analysis we can neglect highly oscillating
terms, as we shall use soon. Now, by writing the Hamiltonian @xmath in
rotating frame by using @xmath we find

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (330)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where we define @xmath and we already used that @xmath , where @xmath
and @xmath . Now, by neglecting the highly oscillating terms, it is
possible to proof that we get

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (331)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Now, by using that @xmath , we find

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (332)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Therefore, the above Hamiltonian can be used to implement an arbitrary
dynamics of the qubit encoded as shown in Fig. 2 .

#### d.3 State detection and tomography process

To read out the outcome of some operation in the trapped ion system used
in this thesis, it is used a ion fluorescence technique [ 179 ] . In
Ytterbium trapped ion systems, this technique is applied by brightening
the ion with light at @xmath nm, where we promote transitions from the
state @xmath to @xmath [ 83 ] . This process allows us to determinate
the population in energy level @xmath , since the state @xmath is a dark
state for the laser at @xmath nm. After repeating this procedure many
times, it is possible to accurately estimate the probability in bright
state @xmath and the dark one. If some population is present in state
@xmath , few photons are detected due to the background scattering, and
the dark counting of the photomultiplier tube (a high efficiency
detector used to measure the ion fluorescence during the state
detection). On the other hand, a large number of photons are scattered
by the system when the system is in state @xmath . These scattered
photons are collected by a numerical aperture @xmath objective lens.
After a processing of the captured photons, it is possible to estimate
that the measurement fidelity is around @xmath [ 43 ] .

In terms of state tomography, the above procedure is used to estimate
the values of the quantities @xmath and @xmath of an unknown state
@xmath . Therefore, to measure the system state we need to follow the
tomography standard process where we need to measure a number of
different parameters in order to reconstruct the density matrix of the
system [ 150 ] . In our case, the state tomography is obtained from
three parameters, since an arbitrary density matrix for a two-level
system can be written as in Eq. ( 18 ).

#### d.4 Controllable dephasing in trapped ion systems

In order to simulate the coupling of our qubit with a dephasing
reservoir, it is used frequency modulation (FM) method where a Gaussian
noise is introduced by mixing the field @xmath . The experimental is
sketched in Fig. 10 . After this process, the new magnetic field reads
as (the experiment considered in this thesis sets @xmath in Eq. ( 332
).)

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (333)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the noise source is encoded in the function @xmath , with @xmath
being the average amplitude of the noise, @xmath is a random analog
voltage signal and @xmath is the modulation depth supported by the
commercial microwave generator E8257D. Here we want to demonstrate that
this Gaussian noise can be used to implement the dynamics given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (334)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath being the desired decohering rate. To this end, we consider
here the time-independent Hamiltonian @xmath obtained from Eq. ( 332 )
with @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . That is, a resonant microwave with
Rabi frequency @xmath . Therefore, experimentally we can proof that the
dynamics is given by the above equation in two different ways: i) by
accompanying the dynamics of the system and ii) by computing the process
matrix @xmath that describes the quantum process. Here we will consider
both protocols.

By taking into account a particular dynamics of a system driven by the
Hamiltonian @xmath , from Eq. ( 334 ) we can write the Bloch equations
for @xmath as (with @xmath )

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (335)
     @xmath   @xmath      (336)
     @xmath   @xmath      (337)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

whose solution for the initial condition @xmath reads as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (338)
     @xmath               (339)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Therefore, by defining the projector @xmath computing the population in
state excited state @xmath we get

  -- -- -- -------
           (340)
  -- -- -- -------

where in the limit @xmath we recover the well-known equation @xmath . As
we can see, the behavior of @xmath is a damped oscillating function that
converges to @xmath in the regime @xmath , where the damping rate is
dictated by the parameter @xmath .

To show how to simulate the non-unitary dynamics in Eq. ( 334 ), the
experimental realization it was considered with the parameter @xmath KHz
and the modulation depth @xmath as @xmath KHz/V, here both parameters
@xmath and @xmath are kept fixed for all the experiments. Thus, by
adjusting the amplitude noise @xmath , different dynamics were
implemented. We experimentally evaluated the quantity @xmath to get the
Rabi oscillations of the system for each dynamics during a total time
interval of @xmath ms. The result are shown in Fig. 18 a for the Rabi
oscillations between states @xmath and @xmath . For different values of
the amplitude @xmath , it is possible to see different behaviors, each
one of them associated with distinct values of @xmath . Moreover, it is
possible to experimentally evaluate the relation between the dephasing
rate @xmath and the noise amplitude @xmath , where we used the graph in
Fig. 18 b to this end. By evaluating the square root of @xmath we find a
linear behavior as @xmath increases, so through the linear regression
method we find (approximately)

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (341)
  -- -------- -- -------

and this show that a perfect control of decoherence rate in Eq. ( 334 )
is obtained from a precise control of amplitude noise.

As a second, and complementary, analysis of the decohering dynamics it
was used the tomography process to reconstruct the process matrix @xmath
. Let us now give brief introduction to the matrix @xmath used to
completely describe a physical process. A general physical process is
adequately characterized by the equation [ 150 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (342)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a complete set of @xmath operation elements that satisfy
@xmath , because @xmath should be a trace-preserving operation. In
general we have a specific set @xmath for each process considered, so
for this reason it is convenient to consider a fixed basis of @xmath
operators @xmath so that we can write @xmath . Therefore, we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (343)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, since the set is early defined, the above equation tells that
the process is characterized by a matrix with elements @xmath . Thus, by
following this process we adopted the reference basis for a single-qubit
tomography process as @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath in the case
where the dynamics is simulated with @xmath KHz, where we set the total
evolution time as @xmath ms (here, the noise amplitude is 1.62 V and the
modulation depth is 96.00 KHz/V). The resulting estimated process matrix
is shown in Fig. 19 . Then, the fidelity between the simulated and
desired process can be obtained by evaluating the fidelity between
theoretical and experimental process matrices defined as

  -- -- -- -------
           (344)
  -- -- -- -------

For example, when the amplitude of the noise is set to @xmath V, the
process fidelities are measured as @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath , at times @xmath ms, @xmath ms, @xmath ms, @xmath ms and @xmath
ms, respectively. Thus, the dephasing channel can be precisely
controlled as desired and it can support the scheme to implement the
time-dependent dephasing in experiment. A point to be highlighted here
is the case where @xmath , situation in which the system evolves under
its natural dephasing rate @xmath . From Eq. ( 341 ) one finds that
@xmath Hz. Thus, we can see that, if we change the parameter @xmath ,
which we can done with high controllability, the quantity @xmath can be
efficiently controlled. On the other hand, if we need a time-dependent
rate @xmath , we just need to consider a way to vary @xmath as a
function @xmath . To this end, we use a second channel (CH2) of the AWG
to perform amplitude modulation (AM) of the Gaussian noise. The temporal
dependence of @xmath is achieved by programming the channel (CH2) to
change the noise amplitude along the evolution.

## Appendix E Nuclear Magnetic Resonance experimental setup

In NMR experimental implementations for quantum information processing,
we encode the quantum bit into degree of freedom associated with the
nuclear spin of atoms in molecules. The NMR qubits used in this thesis
are the carbon nuclei ( @xmath C) and the hydrogen nuclei ( @xmath H).
However, independent on the nucleon used in our discussion, it is
possible to derive the Hamiltonian used to drive the system and,
consequently, implement quantum gates on the qubits. By applying a
strong static magnetic field @xmath along some direction (let’s say the
direction @xmath ), we are choosing an quantization axes and different
the spin states (spin up @xmath and spin down @xmath ) of the nuclei set
a energy splitting of energy given by @xmath , so that we can write the
internal Hamiltonian as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (345)
  -- -------- -- -------

called Zeeman Hamiltonian due to the Zeeman interaction occurring
between the magnetic dipole moment of the nuclei and the local magnetic
fields. The quantity @xmath is the Larmor frequency and it is a
characteristic parameter of the nuclei used in experiment; it is
associated with the gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus @xmath as @xmath .

Therefore, the qubit is encoded in states @xmath and @xmath as @xmath
and @xmath . The qubit is driven by an transverse rotating field called
radio-frequency (RF) field @xmath given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (346)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the rotating frequency of the field @xmath . Therefore,
the single-qubit Hamiltonian is a combination of the Zeeman and RF
Hamiltonian, this gives

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (347)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath and @xmath . In general, since the field @xmath is much less
intense than @xmath , it is convenient to consider the qubit dynamics in
rotating frame as done in Appendix A . By doing that, we find the driven
Hamiltonian in rotating frame as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (348)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the term @xmath is the effective Zeeman Hamiltonian. Therefore,
when we set @xmath we find the resulting Hamiltonian in rotating frame
at resonance as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (349)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then, by letting the system evolve under this Hamiltonian we get the
evolution operator given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (350)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we defined the angle @xmath , with @xmath being the pulse duration
of the RF field. Therefore, we can adjust the time interval of each RF
pulse in order to select an arbitrary value for @xmath . After such
pulse, the system is again governed by the effective Zeeman Hamiltonian,
through a “free evolution”. In this case, the evolution operator becomes

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (351)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we define the angle @xmath . Therefore, by using pulses @xmath and
free evolution @xmath we can implement any single-qubit rotation [ 152 ]
.

In addition, the Hamiltonian that describes a two-qubit system here is
obtained by considering the nuclear Zeeman effect, chemical shifts (due
to the orbital motion of nearby electrons) and @xmath -coupling
(interaction between the nuclear magnetic dipole moments of neighbor
nuclei), which are represented by the following secular Hamiltonian (for
spin- @xmath nuclei)

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (352)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the nuclear spin operators along the quantization axes
for the @xmath -th nuclei. Therefore, since the @xmath -coupling can be
used to implement any controlled phase gate [ 31 ] , it is possible to
implement universal quantum computation with these number of single and
two-qubit gates discussed here.

#### e.1 Pulses composition for adiabatic and TQD quantum gates

From a Trotter decomposition approach for a time-dependent quantum
Hamiltonian (see, e.g., Ref. [ 150 ] ), we use the pulse sequence shown
in Fig. 16 a to implement each Hamiltonian in Eqs. ( 280a ), ( 280b )
and ( 280c ). The algorithm is composed by rotations @xmath and free
evolutions. The rotations are implemented of an angle @xmath around a
direction @xmath , whose the rotation operator reads [ 150 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (353)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , with @xmath being the Pauli matrices. Each direction
@xmath of the rotations in Fig. 16 a -I are obtained from

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (354)
  -- -------- -- -------

with

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (355)
  -- -------- -- -------

The free evolution used in circuits of the Figs. 16 a -I and 16 a -II
appear as a consequence of the natural spin evolution of the nuclei in
our chloroform molecule, so that the evolution operator reads as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (356)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (357)
  -- -------- -- -------

In our experiment, the interaction between the spins is constant with
strength @xmath Hz, so that we need to manipulate some additional
parameters in order to implement different values of @xmath of the
interaction term in Eqs. ( 280 ). To this end, we use a free evolution
for coupled spins so that we can map the parameter @xmath from two
parameter @xmath and the time intervals @xmath of each free evolutions.
This relation is obtained as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (358)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

For Fig. 16 a -III, the Hamiltonian is constant and the time interval is
then given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (359)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, we can choose the value of transitionless total evolution
time @xmath according with the parameter @xmath , for a constant value
of @xmath .

## Chapter \thechapter Adiabatic dynamics in open system

## Appendix F Evolution operator for adiabatic dynamics in open system

Here we study some properties of the evolution operator @xmath as
derived in Eq. ( 135 ). First, given the evolution operator @xmath , let
us show a necessary and sufficient condition to find @xmath so that
@xmath . To this, let us define

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (360)
  -- -------- -- -------

with each operator @xmath obtained from

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (361)
  -- -------- -- -------

with parameters @xmath to be determined. This definition is convenient
because we can write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (362)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we use the orthogonality relation between right- and left-hand
side quasi-eigenvectors. Now, we write

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (363)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where we already used the Eq. ( 362 ). Thus

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (364)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Now, computing the matrix elements @xmath , we get (to simplify the
notation, from now on we will omit the time-dependence of the
coefficients @xmath and @xmath )

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (365)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Therefore, to obtain @xmath the coefficients need to satisfy

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (366)
  -- -------- -- -------

A second important property of the operator @xmath is related with the
Jordan block form of the Lindbladian. To proof it, let us consider a
operator @xmath given by @xmath , so we have

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (367)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Now let us analyze the each matrix @xmath

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

where we already used the quasi-eigenvalue equation. Thus, due
orthogonality of the basis we write

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

and due the @xmath , we can write

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (368)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

By computing the matrix elements of @xmath in basis @xmath , we get

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (369)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

As a first result, we can see that @xmath for any element outside some
block, it means that @xmath is block diagonal in this basis. Thus, the
elements of a single block are

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (370)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

The above equation provides us some new conditions on the coefficients
which allows us to identify the elements @xmath as the elements of the
Jordan-Block form for @xmath . In fact, if we impose that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (371)
  -- -------- -- -------

we find the diagonal elements of a single block as

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (372)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

It is important to remark that the second condition in Eq. ( 371 ) does
not imply in condition in Eq. ( 366 ). In case we are interested in get
a Jordan block decomposition, the first element after a diagonal element
should be @xmath , that is, a third condition should provides

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (373)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the last condition is associated with last element in Jordan
block. However, the last equation is automatically satisfied because
@xmath , for construction. Therefore, we just need to have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (374)
  -- -------- -- -------

whose a possible solution is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (375)
  -- -------- -- -------

## Chapter \thechapter Complementary discussion on transitionless
quantum driving

## Appendix G Transitionless quantum driving in closed systems

As a first task, let us proof the Theorem \thechapter .1 . To this end,
consider a @xmath -dimensional quantum system and adopt as a measure of
energy cost the Hamiltonian Hilbert-Schmidt norm, which reads

  -- -- -- -------
           (376)
  -- -- -- -------

Then, we obtain

  -- -- -- -------
           (377)
  -- -- -- -------

By taking the trace of @xmath in Eq. ( 377 ), we have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (378)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then

  -- -- -- -------
           (379)
  -- -- -- -------

where we have @xmath . We can now find out the functions @xmath that
minimize the energy cost in transitionless evolutions. For this end, we
minimize the quantity @xmath for the Hamiltonian @xmath with respect to
parameters @xmath , where we will adopt it being independents. By
evaluating @xmath , we obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (380)
  -- -------- -- -------

We then impose @xmath Tr @xmath for all time @xmath , which ensures
@xmath . Thus, by using Eq. ( 378 ), we write

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (381)
  -- -------- -- -------

This implies

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (382)
  -- -------- -- -------

From the second derivative analysis, it follows that the choice for
@xmath as in Eq. ( 382 ) necessarily minimizes the energy cost, namely,
@xmath , which concludes the proof.

Now, to proof the Theorem \thechapter .2 we need to take the time
derivative of the Hamiltonian @xmath , where we obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (383)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then, the matrix elements of @xmath in the eigenbasis @xmath of the
Hamiltonian @xmath read

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (384)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Now, in second term of the above equation we can use that @xmath , to
write @xmath and thus

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (385)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

For @xmath in Eq. ( 385 ), we impose the vanishing of the diagonal
elements of @xmath , namely, @xmath . This yields

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (386)
  -- -------- -- -------

On the other hand, for @xmath in Eq. ( 385 ), we now impose the
vanishing of the off-diagonal elements of @xmath , namely, @xmath @xmath
. This yields

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (387)
  -- -------- -- -------

By taking @xmath in Eq. ( 386 ), with @xmath denoting by hypothesis
complex constants, we get @xmath , namely, @xmath is a constant function
@xmath @xmath . Moreover, by using that @xmath in Eq. ( 387 ), with
@xmath denoting nonvanishing complex constants, we obtain @xmath ,
@xmath @xmath . If @xmath , then @xmath and @xmath are not necessarily
equal, but Eq. ( 387 ) will also be satisfied by this choice. Therefore,
it follows that @xmath can be simply taken as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (388)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath a single real constant. This concludes the proof.
