This thesis explores the teleo-reactive programming paradigm for
controlling autonomous agents, such as robots. Teleo-reactive
programming provides a robust, opportunistic method for goal-directed
programming that continuously reacts to the sensed environment. In
particular, the TR and TeleoR systems are investigated. They influence
the design of a teleo-reactive system programming in Python, for
controlling autonomous agents via the Pedro communications architecture.
To demonstrate the system, it is used as a controller in a simple game.
