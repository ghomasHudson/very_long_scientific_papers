We consider different aspects of the virtual Compton amplitude in QCD on
two examples: small-x physics accessible in the Regge regime and twist-3
approximation in the description of DVCS through the general parton
distributions. Using this model, we give an estimate for the cross
section of deeply virtual Compton scattering for the kinematics of CEBAF
at Jefferson Lab.
