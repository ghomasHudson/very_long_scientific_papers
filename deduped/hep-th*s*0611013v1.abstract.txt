In this thesis, we report on different aspects of integrability in
supersymmetric gauge theories. The main tool of investigation is twistor
geometry. In trying to be self-contained, we first present a brief review about
the basics of twistor geometry. We then focus on the twistor description of
various gauge theories in four and three space-time dimensions. These include
self-dual supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theories and relatives, non-self-dual
SYM theories and supersymmetric Bogomolny models. Furthermore, we present a
detailed investigation of integrability of self-dual SYM theories. In
particular, the twistor construction of infinite-dimensional algebras of hidden
symmetries is given and exemplified by deriving affine extensions of internal
and space-time symmetries. In addition, we derive self-dual SYM hierarchies
within the twistor framework. These hierarchies describe an infinite number of
flows on the respective solution space, where the lowest level flows are
space-time translations. We also derive infinitely many nonlocal conservation
laws.
