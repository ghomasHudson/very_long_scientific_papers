In systems biology, it is common to measure biochemical entities at
different levels of the same biological system. One of the central
problems for the data fusion of such data sets is the heterogeneity of
the data. This thesis discusses two types of heterogeneity. The first
one is the type of data, such as metabolomics, proteomics and RNAseq
data in genomics. These different omics data reflect the properties of
the studied biological system from different perspectives. The second
one is the type of scale, which indicates the measurements obtained at
different scales, such as binary, ordinal, interval and ratio-scaled
variables. In this thesis, we developed several statistical methods
capable to fuse data sets of these two types of heterogeneity. The
advantages of the proposed methods in comparison with other approaches
are assessed using comprehensive simulations as well as the analysis of
real biological data sets.
