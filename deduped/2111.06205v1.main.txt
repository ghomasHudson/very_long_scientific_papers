## Chapter 1 Introduction

  “ And all this science, I don’t understand, It’s just my job five days
  a week”

  — Elton John, Rocketman spacing

The story of protoplanetary systems is a story shared with ourselves.
How did the Earth form? How did life evolve here? Is our story unique?
To answer these questions, we must look to the stars find other such
systems and other such worlds in order to capture snapshots of their
formation.

Protoplanetary disks lie at the junction between large scale star
formation and planetary science. They consist of material left over from
star formation, that will eventually form planets or be dissipated by
stellar winds and accretion. The stages of planet formation are not well
understood, with most theories failing to account for one or more
selections of the now extensive known exoplanet catalogue. The only way
to improve our understanding is to observe protoplanetary disks at all
stages of their evolution in order to piece together the processes
governing these objects.

However, observations of protoplanetary disks are not a simple
undertaking as even the nearest star forming regions are still @xmath
away. As such the angular size of these disks on sky is very small
indeed. It is only in the past few decades that our instrumental
capabilities have advanced far enough to observe such objects. Large
8-10 m class telescopes such as Keck, VLT and Gemini combined with
advanced adaptive optics systems have allowed us spatially resolve the
delicate structures of the outer disks. At the same time the progression
of interferometric techniques both in the sub-mm with ALMA and at
optical wavelengths at VLTI and CHARA has allowed us to observe even the
smallest scales with sub-milli-arcsecond resolution and unprecedented
spectral capabilities.

In this thesis I present the results of my PhD exploring the inner
astronomical unit of protoplanetary disks. The aim of the project was
originally to search for signatures of planet formation within optical
interferometric data, such as gaps, rings and asymmetries. Although no
direct signs of planet formation were found, several phenomena were
observed and applied for the first in my work which provide a vital
piece of the puzzle in the mystery that is how we can exist upon planet
Earth.

In chapter 2 I provide a detailed introduction to protoplanetary disks,
from their humble beginnings in giant molecular clouds through to star,
disk, and later planet formation. I outline some of the key processes
taking place in protoplanetary disks from a theoretical perspective as
well as the later stage evolution of disks. In chapter 3 I approach
protoplanetary disks from an observational perspective, from the first
studies of spectral energy distributions to the latest high angular
resolution observations from cutting edge instruments. I also provide an
overview of some of the key features observed and their potential
connections to planet formation mechanisms. Chapter 4 serves as the
final introductory chapter, providing a description of optical
interferometry including its history and development into the modern
artform used today. I explore the science behind the key observables
used and their analysis from basic modelling to full image
reconstruction techniques.

Chapter 5 focuses on the instrumentation work undertaken during my PhD.
This work is separated into two parts, the first focusing on the
development of a new baseline solution for the CHARA array. In this
endeavour I refined the model which predicts the location of the delay
lines for a given stars position on sky in order to allow easier and
more efficient observations. I succeeded in cutting the amount of time
spent searching for fringes dramatically making it much easier to
observe faint and low fringe contrast objects. The second
instrumentation effort concerns the expansion of the operating
wavelength of the MIRC-X instrument to include the J band. In this work
I modelled and correct for both atmospheric chromatic dispersion and
internal instrument birefringence, in addition to developing the data
reduction and calibration pipeline and conducting the first science
observations in this new dual JH band mode.

Chapter 6 presents observations of the young star SU Aurigae using the
CLIMB and CLASSIC instruments at the CHARA array in combination with
archival KI and PTI observations. I present the first reconstructed
image of the inner disk of SU Aur that confirms that the object is seen
under high inclination and that we detect emission from near the dust
sublimation region. In addition, I present radiative transfer modelling
of the inner disk and curved rim geometry of the sublimation front. I
find that a dusty disk wind is required to model a combination of
interferometric and photometric observations. In chapter 7, I present
follow-up observations of SU Aurigae from CHARA/MIRC-X in the H band
which provide higher resolution and better uv coverage over a shorter
observational timescale. These new observations confirm the presence of
a dusty disk wind and provide an updated image clearly highlighting the
strong, inclination induced, asymmetries in the disk.

In chapter 8 I present the results of the first science observations in
the MIRC-X JH band observing mode of the outbursting young star
FU Orionis. Using the multi-wavelength observations, I derive the
temperature gradient across the inner disk and find it consistent with
theoretical models of a viscously heated accretion disk in contrast to
the standard model of a disk heated only by reprocessed stellar
radiation. This represents one of the first studies to find observation
evidence for viscous heating within an accretion disk, the presence of
which is a hotly debated topic.

Finally, in chapter 9 I present some concluding remarks, including a
summary of the scientific results and some of the key skills and
experience learned during the completion of my PhD. I finish by
providing some context on the planned future work, building upon some
this work.

## Chapter 2 Theory of Protoplanetary Disks

  “You’re a shining star. No matter who you are. Shining bright to see.
  What you could truly be”

  — Earth, Wind and Fire, Shining Star spacing

Our understanding of protoplanetary disks and their roles in the
formation of planets like our own has evolved dramatically over the past
few decades, in a large part thanks to a wealth of observational data.
In this chapter I will discuss the formation and evolution of
protoplanetary disks, including the formation of planets and solar
systems. I will then go into greater detail regarding some of the most
fundamental processes at work in these disks and how our understanding
has evolved over time.

### 2.1 Star Formation & Protoplanetary Disks

#### 2.1.1 Star Formation

Our inherent understanding of protoplanetary disks is based in our
comprehension of their formation and its precursor, star formation. It
is therefore imperative that the narrative begins with the story of how
stars are born within giant molecular clouds. These interstellar clouds
often many parsecs across are predominantly formed of molecular hydrogen
gas, making them difficult to detect despite their size. However, small
amounts of other compounds such as carbon monoxide (CO) and ammonia (
@xmath ) make the mapping of these stellar nurseries possible through
their emission/absorption features. Clouds are astronomical in size
ranging from 10s to 100s of parsecs containing up to several million
solar masses of material ( Murray11 ) . Such large clouds are not
uniform entities, instead their structures are complex comprising of
filaments, sheets, bubbles and irregular clumps. Filaments are large
dense substructures which are ubiquitous across molecular clouds; it is
primarily from these structures which the fragmentation and contraction
of star formation occurs. This is evidenced in the fact that pre-stellar
cores and young stellar clusters are preferentially located within
filaments ( Schmalzl10 ; Konyves15 ) .

The causes of the initial fragmentation of filaments is not well
understood but is likely thought to be due to linear perturbations or
environmental factors such as turbulence or magnetic fields ( Chira18 )
. As a filament collapses it will break into gravitationally bound
cores, where if gravitational forces are sufficient, the cloud can begin
to collapse. The mass above which a molecular cloud will begin to
collapse is known as the Jeans mass ( Jeans02 ) , which is typically of
the order of tens of thousands of solar masses. Jeans mass is reached
when the internal gas pressure is no longer sufficient to maintain
equilibrium with the gravitational force and is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the Jeans mass, @xmath is the gas sound speed, @xmath is
the gravitational constant and @xmath is the density of the cloud. For a
cloud of @xmath and a temperature of 20 K, the critical density required
to trigger the collapse of the cloud is @xmath . The collapse of the
cloud and subsequent pre-stellar cores will continue until the internal
pressure is once again sufficient to maintain equilibrium with gravity.
Eventually, the density of material is such that the cores become opaque
and less efficient at radiating away energy, leading to an increase in
temperature, creating an object known as a stellar embryo.

A stellar embryo will continue to contract, further raising the
temperature. Eventually the gas will become hot enough for the internal
pressure to support itself against the gravitational collapse. Once this
hydrostatic equilibrium has been reached, the resulting object is known
as the first hydrostatic core (FHSC), a molecular hydrogen object (
Larson69 ) . When the temperature of the FHSC reaches around @xmath the
molecular hydrogen will dislocate and later ionise creating a true
protostar ( Hayashi66 ; Larson03 ) . Depending on the mass of material
in a molecular core it can take between 1-10 Myr for a protostar to
form, while the whole protostellar phase only lasts around 500,000 yr (
Dunham14 ) . The higher the mass of an object the shorter its lifespan
at any stage of evolution.

The small scale primordial motions of the original molecular cloud are
preserved and enhanced by the conservation of angular momentum. Angular
momentum can be simply calculated through

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is angular momentum, @xmath is radius, @xmath is mass and
@xmath is the angular velocity. If one assumes that no mass is lost, it
is trivial that the same mass concentrated within a smaller radius, must
have a higher angular velocity in order to conserve the angular
momentum. In reality much mass and hence angular momentum is lost during
the star formation phase, this is known as the spin-up of a protostar.
It is from this foundation of a rotating protostar and surrounding
envelope that protoplanetary disks will begin to form.

#### 2.1.2 Formation of Protoplanetary Disks

A large amount of the original material of the molecular cloud is
located within the newly formed (class 0) protostars. However, a
majority of material remains within a spherical envelope surrounding the
star. This material will continue its infall onto the central star in a
process known as accretion (see Section 2.4 for a detailed discussion).
However, in the radial direction around the protostellar equator
centripetal acceleration caused by the rapid rotation is able to resist
the gravitational pull of the star. In this way material in a thin
radial disk will be preserved while material outside of this plane is
free to collapse onto the star. This processes of disk formation is
shown in Figure 2.1 .

This is the most simplistic disk structure, a thin disk of dust and gas
aligned with the rotation of the star, which is slowly accreting onto
the central object. This stage of evolution typically lasts 3-5 Myr,
with some very large disks surviving as long as 10 Myr ( Russell06 ) .
The composition of the disk is thought to be around 99% gas and 1% solid
dusty material, a general assumption equal to the composition of the
interstellar medium ( Bohlin78 ) . The evolution of disks beyond their
formation is geared towards planetary formation, hence the name
protoplanetary disks, the fundamentals of planet formations within disks
is described in detail in the following section.

At this stage it is useful to define the nomenclature used when
referring to your star-disk systems. In the earliest stages of
evolution, young systems are referred to by a class structure based on
shape of their spectral energy distribution. This is described more in
Section 3.2.1. Once young stars reach a more evolved stage, the
overarching term is a young stellar object or YSO which denotes a star
in its early stage of evolution including protostars and
pre-main-sequence stars. In turn this has several subclasses defined by
the stars mass. T Tauri stars are the lowest mass objects, stars below
@xmath typically fall into this class and are typically identified by
their optical variability and strong chromospheric lines ( Joy45 ) .
More massive objects are known as Herbig Ae/Be stars and typically exist
in the @xmath mass range and are of A or B spectral type. YSOs that are
significantly larger than this are simply known as massive YSOs, with
only a few examples known, as their high mass means they evolve very
quickly onto the main sequence. Each of these classes have a set of
conditions which objects must meet in order to be included, however in
reality the boundaries and definitions are often blurred such that
classifications are little more than mass estimates.

### 2.2 Planet Formation Process

The better understanding of planet formation processes is perhaps one of
the ultimate aims in the study of protoplanetary disks. The insights
gained allow us to better understand the formations of our own solar
system and our own planet Earth. Planet formation is thought to occur a
few million years following star formation as material settles into a
denser disk ( Briceno01 ; Bodenheimer02 ) . This timescale is
constrained as material in the disk will be dissipated by outflows and
accretion events over time. When it comes to the creation of planets in
a disk there are two competing theories known as the disk instability
and core accretion scenarios. Both pathways produce planets in
significantly different ways and as such of significantly different
types. However, neither can fully reproduce the observed zoo of planets
and exoplanets discovered in the universe to date ( Matsuo07 ) . The
true story of planet formation is likely more complex and possibly a
combination of different mechanisms depending on disk masses, solar mass
and type and even stellar multiplicity.

#### 2.2.1 Core Accretion Scenario

The core accretion method of planet formation is the slow building of
planets from individual dust grains mere nano-meters across to planets
many thousands of kilometers across ( Pollack96 ) . Within a
protoplanetary disk dust grains are constantly in motion and so
collisions between grains will be relatively common. Upon colliding
small grains may stick together electrostatically through the Van der
Waals force to create slightly larger grains. Van der Waals force is a
quantum effect caused by correlations in the fluctuating polarizations
of nearby particles. This process however is relatively inefficient as
colliding larger grains can also destroy one another rather than stick
together ( Johansen14 ) . Even, so this initial process occurs quite
early on in the planet formation process. Once a planetesimal has grown
to sufficient size, it will begin to gravitationally attract material in
the surrounding area, allowing it to grow rapidly though run-away
accretion ( Rafikov03 ; Schlichting11 ) . Through the collision and
accretion of grains, pebbles, and clumps ( Lambrechts12 ; Lambrechts14 )
, these planetesimals will grow at a steady rate of a few centimeters
per year over a few million years ( Goldreich73 ) . Pebble accretion is
thought to occur when small bodies experience aerodynamic drag from the
gaseous disk; this reduction in velocity increases the likelihood of
accretion onto nearby planetesimals ( Lambrechts14b ) . Eventually, the
core will be able to accrete non-solid material in the form of an
atmosphere. The accretion of gas onto a solid core will cool the gas,
causing the loss of much of the initial entropy, leading to the creation
of a planets with very low initial entropy. For this reason, core
accretion is sometimes known as the term cold start scenario.

The location of these planetesimals within the disk will determine their
composition ( Brown50 ) . For example, the inner regions are too warm
for volatile materials such as water and methane to condense out of
their gaseous forms, hence these cores are made up of materials with
higher melting points such as iron, nickel and silicates ( Urey51 ) .
These heavier elements are significantly rarer in protoplanetary disks
with typical ice/rock ratios, whcih in theoretical works are around
around 2 ( Lodders03 ) . As such, there exists a limit to the size these
inner planets can grow to, whereas planets forming further out in the
disk will have access to more volatile compounds, which are in relative
abundance, allowing for much larger planets to form. These larger
planets can reach sufficient sizes that accretion of hydrogen and helium
can occur, leading to large atmospheres such as those of Jupiter and
Saturn.

The cold start planet formation process alone does not accurately
predict the positioning of the planets within our own solar system, or
in many observed exoplanet populations. In order to correct this,
planetary migration scenarios are proposed whereby planets change their
orbits over periods of time. Perhaps the most famous scenario for
describing the solar system is the ’Nice’ model ( Gomes05 ; Tsiganis05 ;
Morbidelli05 ) . In this model, planetary migration is driven by torques
from the scattering of smaller bodies as giant planets enter resonant
orbits, in particular Jupiter and Saturn. Such a model requires a wide
range of vary specific starting parameters in order to recreate the
known solar system, but still remains a valid theory for the movement of
planets. Another model of planetary migration is the ’Grand Tack’
hypothesis ( Walsh11 ) , whereby Jupiter formed at 3.5 au before
migrating inwards to 1.5 au and then outwards to its current 5.2 au.
Such a model solves the issues with Mars being smaller than its expected
mass ( Wetherill91 ) and the location and composition of the asteroid
belt.

Such migrations have also been invoked in order to understand the
distribution of exoplanet populations. Hot-Jupiter planets are very
large with thick gaseous atmospheres but exists very close to their host
stars in a regions it would be impossible for them to have formed (
Wang15 ) . Additionally, many wide separation exoplanets have been
imaged ( Marois08 ; Nguyen21 ) , often at separations of many 100’s of
au from their central star. Such planets could not form through
core-accretion pathways meaning these planets either migrated to their
current positions or formed through a different mechanism.

#### 2.2.2 Gravitational Instability Scenario

The disk instability scenario is an alternative planet formation model
to describe the formation of giant planets on wide orbits in
protoplanetary disks ( Kuiper51 ; Cameron78 ; Boss97 ) . It relies om
the fact that a disk of sufficient mass will be inherently
gravitationally unstable. However, a gravitationally unstable disk will
not always collapse, the outcome is dependent on the cooling timescale
of the disk ( Kratter16 ) . A long period cooling balances with heating
caused by the dissipation of gravitational turbulence. Whereas for a
short period cooling timescale the heat will be dissapated, without this
extra pressure, the disk can fragment and collapse.

These instabilities lead to the fragmentation of the outer disk into a
series of large clumps, in a similar way to the fragmentation of
molecular clouds in star formation processes as described in Section
2.1.2 . These clumps will then collapse directly, forming a giant
planet, typically of the order @xmath ( Kratter10 ) . In this way most
of the initial entropy of the material is conserved hence the name hot
start.

Disk instability planet formation cannot account for the formation of
all planets, such as the inner planets of our solar system ( Durisen07 )
. However, hot start planets will be larger in radius, hotter and have
higher entropy while young than those formed by core accretion. This
provides observational constraints for which to search for potential
young hot start planets, and several candidates have been found to date
( Sigurdsson03 ; Forrest04 ; Butler04 ) . One of the key limitations is
that for a disk to be gravitationally unstable it must be very massive,
indeed more massive than the majority of observed disks to date. Only a
handful of disks massive enough have been found around the most massive
YSOs.

### 2.3 Basic Disk Properties

Armed with a basic understanding of star, disk, and planet formation
processes one can begin to explore some of the fundamental disk physics
at play and consider what the observational effects of this might be. In
this section, I will discuss some the key physics of protoplanetary
disks and their effects on planet formation and observational astronomy.
For the purposes of consistency and simplicity, this section refers to
intermediate mass stellar objects with full, flared disks which are no
longer highly embedded such as T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be objects.

#### 2.3.1 Flaring

Protoplanetary disks are not flat, but have a vertical height due to the
internal gas pressure which pushes back against the gravitational
collapse of the disk. The vertical height of the disk is therefore
proportional to the gas density as a function of both radius and height.
For an azimuthally symmetric disk which is in hydrostatic equilibrium,
the density is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the surface density and @xmath is the scale height of
the disk at radius @xmath . As such the scale height is dependent on the
relationship between the temperature and surface density profiles of the
disk. However, the temperature is controlled by the amount of stellar
radiation impacting the disk and being absorbed. It is therefore
dependent on the geometry of the disk, in particular its scale height.
This coupling of geometry, temperatures and densities makes deriving an
analytical disk model exceedingly difficult.

One of the first propositions that protoplanetary disks were not flat or
even limited to a fixed opening angle was the work of Kenyon87 . Adams87
demonstrated that several YSOs with strong IR excesses could be modelled
by a massive accretion disk, of which no other evidence was present.
Kenyon87 were able to show that the same selection of objects could
instead be modelled as a low-mass reprocessing disk which flares
slightly as radial distance increases.

A more modern and widely used model is given by Chiang97 was to
approximate the disk as two layers in order to separate the flaring from
the surface geometry. Their models consist of a thin, hot surface layer
which is the only part of the disk directly heated by reprocessing
stellar radiation. Around half of the heat from the layer is radiated
outwards while the rest heats the inner layer of the disk, a cooler
flared disk which is uniformly heated. This approximation allows for the
derivation of an appropriate power law of @xmath , where @xmath is found
encompass most YSOs. This simple relation defines the range of
physically valid flaring scenarios for protoplanetary disks. Iterative
numerical solutions by DAlessio98 and Dullemond02 find similar results.

However, observations of spectral energy distributions found that this
simple flared disk model overestimates the mid-infrared emission, which
is thought to be due to the settling of dust grains relative to the gas
height ( DAlessio99 ) .

#### 2.3.2 Vertical Settling

Within protoplanetary disks it is often easiest to think of dust and gas
as being coupled. However, this is not always the case and the movement
of dust grains can have a large impact on the disk structure despite
only consisting of @xmath of disk mass.

One of the predominant motions of dust grains is the movement of larger
grains from the surface layer of the disk towards the midplane. A dust
grain in the surface layer of a disk will try to follow an inclined
Keplerian orbit, moving in and out of the midplane as it does so. This
is in contrast to the gas which is supported against gravity by its own
pressure. As a consequence of this, the dust grain will experience a
very strong drag force from the gas ( Weidenschilling77 ; Garaud04 ) .
The magnitude of this effect depends on the size of the grain as a small
object ( @xmath ) will have a very large surface area to mass ratio and
so will follow the gas motions. Whereas a large grain with a small
surface area to mass ratio will not follow gas motions and will settle
towards the midplane ( Dullemond04b ) .

The effect of vertical settling is strongly coupled to that of grain
growth. As described in section 2.2.1 grains will coagulate over time
through the van der Waals forces and grow in size, as the grains grow
they settle more towards the midplane. This increases the density of
dust at the midplane which accelerates grain growth causing even deeper
settling in a repetitive cycle. It is only though turbulent mixing that
disks are not perfectly stratified ( Dullemond05 ) .

The removal of large grains from the surface layers of the disk
decreases the scattering efficiency of this region, reducing the
observed disk flux. This has been shown to more accurately account for
observations across the NIR than non-settled disk models ( DAlessio99 )
.

#### 2.3.3 Sublimation

Sublimation is simply the transition of a substances from a solid to
gaseous state without passing through a liquid state. It occurs where
pressures are sufficiently low enough that the substance cannot exist as
a liquid, so an increase in temperature allows for the direct transition
to a gaseous state. Within protoplanetary disks this process occurs in
the innermost regions where temperatures are sufficient to sublimate the
dust grains in the disk. This gives a minimum inner radius at which a
dusty disk can exist, depending on the dust grain composition ( Natta01
; Dullemond01 ) . Such a limit is not imposed on the gaseous disk
component, which is instead truncated through magnetospheric or tidal
interactions.

Dust grains are commonly modelled as graphite or astronomical silicates
(such as olivine) ( Mathis77 ; Draine84 ) . At one atmosphere of
pressure the sublimation temperature of graphite is around @xmath , this
is much lower in the low pressures of protoplanetary disks and is
typically found to be in the range of @xmath . This is further
complicated by grain sizes and local gas density dependencies. Changing
the dust grain size has the effect of changing the fundamental optical
properties of the grain. In this way, the scattering efficiency will
change, a larger grain is more efficient at scattering incident
radiation and can cool more efficiently, allowing them to survive in
higher temperature regions. The gas density dependency is more
complicated. It can be understood by considering that sublimation is the
process of breaking the equilibrium between gas pressure and surface
tension of the grains. The surface tension of a grain attempts to
maintain the solid form, while the gas pressure attempts to pull it
apart, sublimating the grain. The higher the local gas density the more
energy is required sublimate the grains as the gas pressure is lower.
The sublimation temperature of common disk compounds such as graphites
and silicates as a function of gas density within protoplanetary disks
is given by Pollack94 where they find the sublimation temperature varies
as a rough power law

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the sublimation temperature, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
and @xmath are the radial and vertical distance through a disk
respectively ( Isella05 ) . The treatment of sublimation physics within
disks can dramatically affect the shape and scale of the inner regions,
observational consequences of this are explored in Section 3.4.1

### 2.4 Viscosity and Accretion Processes

Viscosity and accretion are perhaps the two most ubiquitous processes in
astrophysics and can be found on all scales from supermassive blackholes
to circum-planetary disks. Our understanding of these processes is
limited as theoretical and observational works do not always agree, but
over the past few decades we have still made great strides to further
our comprehension of these most fundamental of effects.

#### 2.4.1 Viscosity and Viscous Heating

Viscosity is simply the measure of the internal friction that is present
between adjacent layers of fluid undergoing relative motion. Due to
large amounts of shear in disk structures, viscosity should be an
important factor. Indeed, this is the case as material at a greater
radial distance will lag behind in terms of rotational velocity (
Lynden74 ; Frank02 ) . Assuming a Keplerian system, the radial velocity
can be defined as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the radial velocity at radius @xmath , @xmath is the
surface density of the disk and @xmath is the disk viscosity. It is
important to note that this generalisation only applies to thin disks.
Shakura73 showed that a thin disk implies Keplerian physics as the
radial pressure gradient through the disk become unimportant, a thick
disk would not be Keplerian. The radial dependence of rotational
velocity causes a transfer of angular momentum from the fast-inner disk
to the slower outer disk, this loss of angular momentum in the inner
disk causes material to spiral inwards. This infall of material is known
as accretion and is one of the most ubiquitous processes in
astrophysics. It can be demonstrated that viscosity is proportional to
the mass flow rate in the steady state solution

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the rate of mass flow in the disk measured in @xmath .
From this it follows that viscosity determines the rate of radial inflow
(accretion), and hence gravitational potential energy release. It is
common to describe viscosity as an @xmath as prescribed by Shakura73 in
the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the local mean sound speed and @xmath is the scale
height of the disk and @xmath is a free parameter between zero (no
accretion) and approximately one specifying the local rate at which
angular momentum is transported. Later work has since constrained this
value further to @xmath to @xmath on large scales in protoplanetary
disks ( Hartmann98 ; Johansen14 ) . Gratifyingly, many of the properties
of steady thin discs turn out to have rather weak dependences on @xmath
as there is much disagreement between theoretical and observational
models as to the value of @xmath by as much as an order of magnitude (
King07 ) .

From the nature of viscosity, it naturally follows that fluids can be
viscously heated. Viscous heating represents the effect of an
irreversible process by means of which the work done by a fluid on
adjacent layers due to the action of shear forces is transformed into
heat. Circumstellar disks as described by Adams87 are heated only by the
reprocessing (absorption and emission) of stellar radiation, however
viscous heating allows a disk to be heated internally which can
dramatically change the temperature structure of the disk. A viscously
heated disk will create a stronger temperature gradient across the inner
regions where temperature falls off rapidly with radial distance.

As mentioned viscosity arises from the relative motions between layers
of a fluid, the causes of such relative motions has been the subject of
much discussion in literature. One of the preeminent theories for the
source of viscosity is that of magnetorotational instabilities (MRI)
described by Balbus91 and is often called the Balbus–Hawley instability.
In this scenario the disk material contains mobile electrical charges
which are subject to the influence of the magnetic field ( King07 ) .
This magnetised material will feel the effect of the Lorentz force in
which charge carriers orbit magnetic field lines. If the fluid is in a
state of differential rotation about a fixed origin, this Lorentz force
can be surprisingly disruptive, even if the magnetic field is very weak.
This holds true for disk geometries where the angular rotational
velocity decreases with radial distance as shown in equation 2.5 . This
effect is inherently destabalising and results in the turbulent motions
within the disk, creating the necessary conditions for viscous heating.

Various other mechanisms have also been proposed as causes of viscous
heating over the past few decades, including thermal convection ( Lin80
; Ruden86 ) , shear instabilities ( Dubrulle93 ) and gravitational
instabilities ( Tomley91 ; Laughlin94 ) . However, MRI remains the most
plausible explanation for the presence of viscous heating.

#### 2.4.2 Fundamentals of Accretion

As described in the previous section, the radial dependence of rotation
velocity in combination with disk viscousity causes the transfer of
momentum outwards through the disk. This transfer of angular momentum
causes material to spread in a process known as viscous spreading.
Considering an initial ring of material undergoing viscous spreading,
most of the material will move inwards losing energy, but a tail of
matter also moves outwards gaining angular momentum. This spread over
time is demonstrated in Figure 2.2 where an initially thin ring is
spread over a large radius with the majority of mass moving inwards. It
is this movement of material known as accretion which is the one of the
primary mass loss mechanisms in early disks. However, viscosity driven
accretion through the disk is only the first stage, the process of
moving material from the inner disk onto the central star is most often
driven by the magnetic field of the central star.

A young star with a sufficiently strong magnetic field will truncate the
disk as the magnetic stress is sufficient to remove the excess angular
momentum of the nearly Keplerian flow over a narrow transition zone. The
radius of this truncation can be predicted by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

assuming the gas is efficiently coupled to the magnetic field, where
@xmath is the magnetic truncation radius, @xmath is the stellar dipole
moment and @xmath is a parameter @xmath (with @xmath corresponding to
the classical Alfvén radius for spherical accretion) ( Koenigl91 ) .
@xmath is usually confined to a few stellar radii for a moderate
accretion rate of @xmath to @xmath . Interior to this radius disk
material will flow along magnetic field lines out of the disk plane
towards the dipoles of the star, giving rise to magnetospheric accretion
columns ( Alencar12 ) . A schematic of magnetospheric accretion is shown
in Figure 2.3

The infalling gas hits the star along two circular rings of
(cylindrical) radius @xmath and width @xmath , where the parameter
@xmath accounts for the effect of screening currents in the disk (
Koenigl91 ) . (If the magnetic dipole axis is not aligned with the
rotation axes of the disk and the star, then the accreted matter
occupies only a portion of each ring.) This ring comprises of accretion
shocks where the gas collides with the stellar surface at speed of
@xmath ( Sacco10 ) . The strength of these shocks is such that material
in accretion columns can be heated to temperature exceeding several MK (
Gullbring94 ; Lamzin98 ) allowing them to emit highly energetic
radiation such as X-rays.

Magnetospheric column accretion is supported by observational evidence
in the form of inverse P-Cygni profiles in the hydrogen Balmer lines (
Alencar12 ) . P-Cygni profiles occur when the same molecular line is
seen in both absorption and emission at different redshifts. Material
moving towards an observer will absorb radiation, creating a
blue-shifted absorption trough while material moving away will only be
seen through emission creating a red-shifted emission peak. However, an
inverse P-Cygni profile denotes the opposite, red-shifted material is
closer to the observer and so is seen in absorption while blue shifted
material is only seen in emission. A standard P-Cygni profile describes
typical ejection scenarios such as shell ejection, an inverse P-Cygni
profile describes infalling material. By modelling the expected profiles
of hydrogen lines it was found that magnetospheric accretion could
recreate the observations ( Hartmann94 ; Muzerolle01 ) .

### 2.5 Outflows and Mass Loss

Within disk systems material does not only move inwards, indeed a
significant fraction of the mass and angular momentum loss is from the
outward movement of material. This allows stars to reach their final
masses and rotation rates, which are known to be significantly lower
that the total mass and angular momentum contained with the initial
molecular cloud core.

#### 2.5.1 Jets

One of the key aspects of the star formation process outlined in Figure
2.1 is that a fraction of the infalling material is ejected along the
polar direction, perpendicular to the disk equatorial plane. These jets
are thought to be launched centrifugally from the disk surfaces via the
stresses of open magnetic field lines that thread the disk ( Blandford82
) . The full range of the jet launching region is not fully constrained,
but observations by Coffey04 and Coffey07 place the region between
@xmath from the rotational axis. Launched material is superheated by its
proximity to the central star and becomes a narrow jet of ionised gas.
Once ejected these jets are highly collimated with an opening angle of
only a few degrees and travelling at supersonic speeds in the range
@xmath ( Cabrit07 ) . Such jets have been observed at every stage of the
star formation process from very young protostars to more evolved
transitional disks with very low accretion rates ( Rodriguez14 ) .

In dense star forming regions, protostellar jets will often collide with
nearby clouds of dust and gas. The ionised nature of the jets and their
fast velocities causes shock waves through the surrounding nebulosity
emitting radiation. Such objects are known as Herbig-Haro (HH) objects
after the first people to directly study these phenomenon ( Herbig50 ;
Herbig51 ; Haro52 ; Haro53 ; Ambartsumian57 ) . HH objects represent the
first observation and classification of jets from young stars owning to
their bright nebulous emission.

#### 2.5.2 Dusty Disk Winds

Magnetohydrodynamic disk winds describe the process by which material is
removed from the disk surface along magnetic field lines ( Blandford82 ;
Pudritz83 ) . This mechanism is based on the presence of a large-scale,
ordered magnetic field which threads the disk. The field could originate
from the interstellar field that permeates the molecular cloud and is
dragged by in-falling gas into the disk. The magnetic field strength
required to drive these winds is of the order of kGauss. Fields of this
strength have been shown to be present in T Tauri stars ( @xmath for
T Tau) by Guenther99 and Krull99 . In this model material is flung out
along magnetic field lines highly inclined to the disk surface. The high
magnetic pressure gradient above the disk surface accelerates the
material which is then collimated through the azimuthal and poloidal
field components ( Bans12 ) . These centrifugally driven winds are
highly efficient at distributing density above the plane of the disk,
carrying angular momentum away from the disk surface. Dust grains
coupled to the gas will stream into the wind, the distribution of dust
grains within the wind is not well characterised, but is likely
dominated by smaller grains which are better coupled to the gas. Bans12
assume a simple single grain size of @xmath for both disk and wind
models in their radiative transfer work. It is for this reason that
these winds are often referred to as dusty disk winds, schematic of the
dusty disk wind is shown in Figure 2.4 .

A modern iteration of magnetospheric disk winds is given by Bans12 . In
this scenario the wind is launched from the disk surface in a region
between an inner and outer radius, located at a maximum of twice the
sublimation radius. This is because FUV radiation that plays a key role
(through photoevaporation) in the mass loading of gas into the wind at
the inner launching region, at more distant regions the disk is shielded
from FUV radiation by its own wind. The gas density structure is given
as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the density along a flow line at a distance @xmath from
the symmetry axis, that is, along this disk surface. @xmath denotes the
density at the fiducial radius of @xmath , which is given as @xmath au
while @xmath is related to the cylindrical coordinate @xmath through

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath is obtained from the solution of the MHD wind equations. The
into-wind mass transfer is linked to the density through

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the mass outflow rate, @xmath is the stellar mass,
@xmath is the disk scale height and @xmath is the ratio of vertical
speed to Keplerian speed at the disk’s surface. For a full derivation of
the equation and constants, see Blandford82 and ( Safier93 ) . @xmath is
related to the angle @xmath at which the poloidal component of the
magnetic field threads the disk, defining the opening angle of the disk
wind ( Safier93 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

This rate generally controls the magnitude of the NIR excess added by
the dusty wind. It was this addition to the NIR excess which first
inspired the derivation of this process. Many circumstellar disks
exhibit a stronger NIR excess than can be recreated using basic disk
models. This model has been shown to successfully account for the NIR
excess of the SED and the basic visibility features of AB Aur, MWC 275
and RY Tau ( Konigl11 ; Petrov19 ) .

A similar magnetically driven model that has been invoked to explain the
NIR excesses of YSOs is that of a magnetically-supported dust atmosphere
to the inner disk ( Turner14b ) . A buoyant magnetic pressure adds to
the internal gas pressure to create a dusty ’atmosphere’ across the
inner disk. This is thought to be confined only to the inner regions
where the high temperatures ensure good magnetic coupling. Unlike the
dusty disk wind, the material here is not outflowing, but is suspended
by magnetic pressure. The material here is optically thick near the base
of the atmosphere and has been shown to double the fraction of stellar
luminosity reprocessed by the disk.

#### 2.5.3 Photoevaporation

Photoevaporation is the process by which energetic radiation, usually in
the form of far-UV photons, ionises and disperses gas within the surface
layers of protoplanetary disks. Sufficiently energetic UV radiation will
excite Hydrogen and Helium molecules within the disk, causing them to
photodissociate and ionise ( Alexander06a ) . The ionisation of gas will
increase the local thermal energy which counters the gravitational
energy of the disk mass. Beyond some critical radius in the disk the
local thermal energy will break equilibrium, allowing the gas to escape
as a wind ( Alexander06b ) . This radius is known as the Gravitational
Radius and is given by

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.13)
  -- -- -- --------

where @xmath is the gravitational radius, @xmath is the gravitational
constant, @xmath is the mass of central star and @xmath is the sound
speed of the gas (typically @xmath ). Such an effect is particularly
effective at removing material from the disk in the later stages of disk
evolution. In young disks the accretion rate is significantly larger
than photoevaporative winds, however as the accretion rate drops over
time, the effect becomes more significant as it deprives the disk of
material resupply inside of @xmath . At this point, the inner disk
drains on its own, short, viscous time-scale, giving a dispersal time
much shorter than the disk lifetime. This is thought to be one of the
potential mechanisms behind transitional disks, see section 2.6.2 for a
more detailed exploration of disk evolution at this point.

### 2.6 Disk Evolution

The evolution of disks beyond their initial formation is one which
appears to diverge even between objects of similar masses and spectral
types. As a consequence the exact timeline of disk evolution is not well
understood, neither are the effects of the evolutionary stages on the
efficiency of planet formation. In this section, I will discuss some of
the key evolutionary stages which some disks have been observed to go
through and how they might impact the planet formation process.

#### 2.6.1 Variable Accretion & Outbursting Events

Classically, it was not thought that accretion varied much over time,
with only a slow decrease as the disk material is depleted due to
outflows, planet formation and accretion processes. This occurs on long
timescales over several million years of disk evolution. However, our
view of accretion changed dramatically with the characterisation of the
star FU Orionis ( Herbig66 ) . In 1937 FU Ori suddenly increased in
luminosity by @xmath over a matter of a few days and has remained at a
significantly increased brightness ever since, only decreasing by around
@xmath per year. A change in luminosity of such a magnitude and speed
had never been observed before outside of supernovae, particularly in a
usually quiescent star. However, since this discovery over a dozen
similar objects have been observed undergoing a similar event ( Herbig77
; Audard14 ) . This class of star have been dubbed FUors after the
archetypal FU Ori.

The causes of such a marked increase in the brightness of FUors was the
subject of much speculation until Hartmann85 argued that a rapid
accretion rate onto the central star could be the cause. In this
scenario, a large amount of material from of the disk falls onto the
central star, leading to a large increase in the accretion rate over a
very short time scale. The expected molecular lines of such a scenario
matched high spectral resolution observations of several FUor stars (
Zhu09 ) , and this scenario has since become widely accepted and the
driving force behind outbursting events.

The question of the driving force behind the change in accretion rate
however, is still an unanswered question. Various scenarios have been
proposed to explain the massive increase in accretion rate seen in these
objects. Vorobyov05 ; Vorobyov06 propose gravitational instabilities on
large scales cause the disk to fragment and for clumps of material to
fall onto the central star. Bell94 suggest that a thermal instability in
the very inner regions ( @xmath ) could be sufficient to cause outbursts
of this magnitude. Bonnell92 propose that a binary companion on a highly
eccentric orbit could perturb the disk and cause repeated outburst of
accretion. Similarly, Reipurth04 suggest that FUor stars are newly
created binary systems, where the two stars become bound following the
breakup of larger multiple systems. Such a scenario leads to the
ejection of companions and the rapid infall of material. However, given
the limited number of known FUors there is little consensus on the FUor
outburst triggering mechanism.

The prospect of variable accretion also goes some way to solving other
astrophysical problems, notably, the young star luminosity problem. YSOs
are known to be 10-100 times less luminous than expected from
steady-state accretion scenarios ( Kenyon90 ) . Particularly given the
accretion rates of the order @xmath to @xmath observed around many YSOs.
However, if FUor outbursting events are not limited to a subset of stars
and variable accretion is a more ubiquitous process, this goes some way
to explaining the observed luminosity deficit. The possibility of most
YSOs undergoing multiple outbursting events during their early evolution
is explored extensively by Kenyon95 and Evans09 . Figure 2.5 shows a
model accretion scenario that is thought to be typical for many YSOs.
FUor outbursts occur every @xmath 100,000 years over the early stages of
disk evolution while the disk is replenished by the wider envelope (
Audard14 ) . As the envelope depletes, outbursts become smaller and less
frequent. As the disk ages and the envelope and later the disk itself
are depleted, accretion stabilises into a steady state scenario.

A secondary class of star which is also thought to exhibit variable
accretion are EX Lupus objects or EXors, which exhibit similar outbursts
to their FUor counterparts. These outbursts are typically weaker and
shorter, only increasing in brightness by @xmath and lasting @xmath days
( Audard14 ) . In some cases they also occur more frequently, being
separated by only a matter of months. Similarly to FUor objects, the
cause of these outbursts is thought to be an enhanced rate of accretion
onto the stellar surface.

#### 2.6.2 Transitional Disks

Transitional disks are so called because they link together two key
stages in planet formation. They provide the bridge between optically
thick flared disks and dissipated planetary/debris systems ( Espaillat14
) . They were first identified by their distinct lack of NIR excess,
while simultaneously exhibiting strong MIR and FIR excesses ( Strom89 )
. Such observations indicate the absence of an inner disk, or at least
the absence of a dust component to the inner disk. In addition to
transitional disks, a sub-class known as pre-transitional has been
observed which exhibit an inner gap as opposed to an a hole ( Brown07 )
. Figure 2.6 shows the difference in disk geometries between full,
pre-transitional and transitional disks.

Currently dozens of transitional disks have been discovered indicating
that this is a ubiquitous and vital stage of disk evolution. The exact
causes of the absence of an inner disk is not well understood, however
the strongest suggestion is that this is the natural consequence of core
accretion planet formation ( Paardekooper04 ; Zhu11 ) . Standard planet
formation models predict that a protoplanet will clear a region of the
disk through accretion and tidal forces. Indeed several transitional or
pre-transitional disks have reported examples of protoplanet candidates
(e.g. PDS 70; Keppler18 ; Haffert19 ) . These clearings detected in the
dust disk often coincide with gas cavities in the same region, as
expected if cleared by a forming planet ( vanderMarel18 ) . The
combination of these dust cavities with the presence of continuing gas
accretion onto the central star is a challenge to theories of disk
clearing. Even if companions are not responsible for the clearings seen
in all (pre-)transitional disks, these objects still have the potential
to inform our understanding of how disks dissipate, primarily by
providing constraints for disk clearing models involving
photoevaporation and grain growth ( Dullemond05 ; Alexander07 ) .

#### 2.6.3 Debris Disks

A very late stage of evolution is a class of disks known as debris
disks. Debris disks are gas depleted, disks of circumstellar dust which
have been found around many older stars (typically @xmath ) such as Beta
Pictoris, Fomalhaut and 51 Ophuichi ( Smith84 ; Mennesson13 ; Stark09 )
. These are thought to have evolved is one of two ways. Firstly, they
could be natural progression of disk evolution, where accretion and
radiation pressure removes almost all the gas from a protoplanetary
disk, leaving behind only a dusty remnant. However, it is thought that
the lifetime of dust grains is significantly shorter that the ages of
debris disk systems owing to the Poynting-Robertson effect, radiation
pressure and partial collisions. Therefore, this dust likely formed
after the protoplanetary disk stage, from the collision of planetesimals
in an extrasolar analogue to the Kuiper belt within our own solar system
( Wyatt08 ) . These collisions cause the breakdown of large scale
objects to mm sized grains in what can be seen as a reversal of the
planet formation process.

  the moon”

Our understanding of protoplanetary disk has evolved with the
capabilities of our observatories. From initial hints at the presence of
disks from photometric infrared excess to exquisite high resolution
imaging, the past few decades have opened doors to previously undreamt
of realms of astrophysics. In this section I summarise the observational
techniques used to explore protoplanetary disks and scientific insights
gleaned from them.

### 3.1 Spectral Energy Distributions

The small angular size of protoplanetary disks has historically made
spatially resolved observations difficult. It is only over the past few
decades with the building of larger aperture telescopes and the
development of interferometry that we have been able to directly study
the structures of these disks. As an alternative astronomers have
typically relied on indirect methods to study disks, the most prominent
of these being the interpretation of spectral energy distributions
(SEDs).

An SED is simply a plot of the measured energy against the frequency or
wavelength of light emitted. The shape and magnitude of the SED encodes
the geometry of the source and is a powerful diagnostic tool for
astronomers. The most basic form of an SED is that of a blackbody which
can be used to approximate the photosphere of a single star. Additional
material surrounds the star provides additional flux to the SED in the
form of an excess to the blackbody curve. Figure 3.1 shows the expected
evolution of an SED over the lifetime of a solar-mass young star from
being completely enclosed within its envelope to the full planetary
system. It shows that disk material close to the central star is hotter
and so contributes to shorter wavelength excess across the infrared,
which is the first region to be cleared by stellar radiation. The longer
wavelength sub-mm and radio emission is dominated by colder material
further from the central star, which persists longer against radiation
pressure.

The different stages of SED evolution allow us to split objects into a
loose class system based upon the slope of the spectral index ( Lada84 )
. The spectral index is typically measured at @xmath and is a measure of
the strength of infrared excess over the blackbody of central star. A
class I object has a very strong IR excess extending to shorter
wavelengths owing to the surrounding protostellar envelope remnants
resulting in reprocessed light from the shock fronts that develop as
material falls onto the protostar and disk. A class II object is where a
strong IR excess is still present, but contributes little to shorter
wavelengths. These objects can also exhibit soft X-ray and UV excesses
from the shock of accreting material onto the stellar surface. Finally,
class III objects refer to an object with little-to-no IR excess, these
are typically debris disk or main-sequence stars. The small amount of
excess present likely originates from the secondary generation dust
particles found there.

Subsequent to the three stage classification developed by Lada84 two
additional classes have been added. Class 0 objects represent the very
earliest stages of collapse of a cloud core and are characterised by no
infrared emission owning to colder temperatures and lack of fully formed
star ( Andre02 ) . A flat-spectrum (FS) source is a halfway point
between class I and II objects ( Greene94 ) .

#### 3.1.1 Characteristics of SEDs

As discussed, the wavelength of emission corresponds to the temperature
of the emitting region meaning a great deal of additional detail can be
gauged from the shape of the spectral energy distribution. However, the
interpretation of the SED must be taken in the context of the disk
structure, in particular the inclination of the disk. A disk of moderate
to high inclination will be self-shadowed by its own flaring, altering
the regions of disk that are seen by an observer. A disk of sufficiently
high inclination will also obscure the central star due to extreme
line-of-sight extinction. Only with some understanding of the viewing
geometry can an SED be understood. The different regions of an SED
correspond to different regions of the disk and different geometric and
compositional aspects. An example SED of the young star SU Aurigae is
shown in Figure 3.2 , the regions A through E are described here:

1.  [label=]

2.  Short wavelength radiation across the UV and optical parts of the
    spectrum is dominated by the stellar photosphere. There is almost no
    contribution from the disk itself owing to its relatively cold
    temperature (typically @xmath ). An exception to this is in objects
    with a very high accretion rate such as FUor and EXor objects where
    accretion shocks and material interior to the sublimation rim will
    contribute significantly to this regime.

3.  In full disks the NIR ( @xmath ) region is in a strong excess over
    stellar emission owing to the presence of hot dust close to the
    central star. Much of this emission is thought to arise from the
    sublimation rim of the disk, the structure of which is described in
    Section 1.3.3. The gradient of this region can be used to estimate
    the radial temperature gradient of the disk and the magnitude of the
    excess can indicate the presence of other processes such as disk
    winds and puffed up sublimation rims.

4.  One of the most prominent features is known as the @xmath silicate
    emission feature which is present in many SEDs, in particular this
    feature is attributed to stretching of the Si-O bonds in silicates.
    The variation in emission strength and shape can be well explained
    by the dominant grain size in the upper layers of a disk (
    Przygodda03 ; Olofsson09 ) . Smaller sub-micron sized grains result
    in a larger, more pointed silicate feature; inversely larger grains,
    several microns in size create a weaker, flatter silicate feature (
    Kessler06 ) . As such, the size and shape can be used as an
    indicator for grain growth within a protoplanetary disk, and
    important stage in planet formation. Studies such as Kessler06 and
    Lommen10 track the growth of dust grains across a wide range of disk
    types and ages and find that the shape and size of the silicate
    feature correlates well with the expected grain size.

5.  This region of the SED typically lies between @xmath , corresponding
    to slightly cooler regions of the disk. At these radii the disk is
    still optically thick allowing the dust to contribute to continuum
    emission. This region will typically also be the turn-over point of
    the SED, this is where the coolest material of disk is reached
    meaning the SED begins to turn down.

6.  Another region of the SED that can provide useful information is the
    shape at millimetre-plus wavelengths, the so called millimetre
    slope. Emission from these regions can provide broad estimates of
    the dust mass of the disk and size of the grains ( Wood02 ) . these
    however, still require assumptions about grain opacity and
    temperature.

#### 3.1.2 Interstellar Extinction

One of the practicalities needed for interpretation of SEDs is the
understanding of interstellar extinction or reddening. As radiation
passes from its source to the observer it will be absorbed and scattered
by dust and gas. This reprocessing is more efficient at shorter
wavelengths, hence blue light is scattered and absorbed more leading to
a reddening of the spectra. The degree of this reddening is determined
by the distance to an object and the presence on any additional material
between the object and observer. Extinction can be measured through

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

were R is the ratio of total to selective extinction in the V band and
typically lies between @xmath and @xmath , but is generally accepted to
be around @xmath . @xmath is the total extinction in the V band and
@xmath is the colour excess calculated across the B and V bands (
Fitzpatrick99 ) .

However, extinction is spectrally and spatially variable, making
correcting for its effects very difficult. The spatial dependence of
extinction arises from the differing composition and density of the
interstellar medium (ISM), often in the local environment of star
forming regions. Differences in the optical properties of the dust
grains, such as their size and composition can affect the degree of
observed reddening. The spatial dependence of extinction is
characterised by the R term of Equation 3.1 where the value of @xmath is
the global mean, and is applicable to most YSOs. The spectral dependence
of extinction is reliant on a knowledge of the spatial dependence, as
different dust grains exhibit different optical properties.
Fitzpatrick99 provide model extinction curves for a variety of values of
R, allowing the extinction to be derived in any wavelength given only
the total extinction in a single band. An example extinction curve for
@xmath for a star at a distance of @xmath with an @xmath is shown in
Figure 3.3 .

By correcting for the effects of extinction, we can explore an SED as if
the ISM were not present, allowing us to interpret astrophysical objects
as they truly are. It is common statistical practice to apply this
correction to the SED model rather than the photometric data points
which comprise the model.

### 3.2 Spectroscopic Observations

The natural evolution of studying a spectral energy distribution is to
study the finer details of the spectra, in particular the emission and
absorption lines of elements and compounds found within. Radiation from
the central star will be reprocessed by molecules within the gas and
dust of a disk, the wavelength of this interaction is highly specific to
the chemistry of the molecule. Hence an over or under brightness at a
particular wavelength of the spectrum is a signpost for the presence of
a particular molecule. In addition, the absorption or emission peaks may
be shifted and broadened by motions relative to the observer, allowing
for the tracing of disk kinematics; including orbital rotation, ejection
outflows and accretion. These aspects make spectroscopic studies of
protoplanetary disks a very powerful technique. In this section, I will
examine some of the most common spectral lines associated with the inner
regions of protoplanetary disks and their ramifications on disk physics.

Perhaps the most common and numerous of the lines are those resulting
from molecular hydrogen, of these numerous series arise from the inner
regions of protoplanetary disks. Primarily the Paschen ( @xmath ),
Brackett ( @xmath ) and Pfund lines ( @xmath ) emit across the infrared.
Of these, one of the commonly studied is the Brackett- @xmath (Br @xmath
) molecular line corresponding to gas temperatures between @xmath and
@xmath . The processes associated with Br @xmath emission are thought to
be mass accretion and ejection scenarios. Work by Kraus08 found that the
radial size of the emitting region relative to the continuum size was
significantly different between the objects in their sample, indicating
that the physical mechanisms traced by the Br @xmath line are varied for
different objects.

The coupling of rotational and vibrational excitations in
carbon-monoxide (CO) creates a distinct emission feature. This is the CO
bandhead so called as it appears in bands in low-resolution spectra and
is found in almost a quarter of YSOs ( Carr89 ) . The first overtone of
this emission is found at around @xmath and is associated with
temperatures of @xmath , conditions which match those found in the very
inner disk. The CO profiles observed in most YSOs are consistent with
gas motions in the innermost regions, in particular accretion processes
( Bik04 ; Ilee14 ) . In particular, Martin97 demonstrate that observed
CO profiles can be recreated through accretion funnels where material
flows from the disk to the star along magnetic field lines. An
alternative scenario proposed to create the conditions needed for CO
bandheads is that of disk wind where large amounts of hot gas are in
motion ( Chandler93 ; Chandler94 ) .

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) profoundly influence the thermal
budget and chemistry of protoplanetary disks ( Meeus01 ; Seok17 ) . PAH
in the surface layers of the disk are directly exposed to stellar
radiation and so are photoionized and provide photoelectrons allowing
for the heating of gas within the disk ( Kamp04 ) . PAHs also have large
surface areas for chemical reactions to occur, which can significantly
alter the carbon chemistry of the disk ( Habart04 ) . Thus the
understanding of PAHs and their presence within protoplanetary disks is
vital to understand the diverse nature of disks and the formation of
planets within them.

In addition to NIR spectroscopic observations, much work has been done
to constrain the chemistry of disks are longer wavelgnths using
specialised instruments such as Spitzer and mm-wavelength observatories
such as ALMA. Pontoppidan14 review the contributions of volatiles in
protoplanetary disks and highluight detections of @xmath , @xmath , HCN,
@xmath and many other molecules in the inner regions of protoplanetary
disks of many stars ( Lahuis06 ; Gibb07 ) . A large scale survey of
disks by Pascucci09 of over 60 disks around low mass stars found that a
significant proportion contained organics, notably HCN in @xmath of
disks. The wide variety of volatiles found in protoplanetary disks
provide the building blocks for complex planets, including those capable
of sustaining life.

### 3.3 Spatially Resolving Protoplanetary Disks

While the SED and spectroscopic studies of protoplanetary disks are
immensely useful, only a limited amount of spatial information can be
obtained. In order to gain a full appreciation for the structure, the
disk must be spatially resolved. This raises a host of challenges, both
instrumentational and analytical, which must be overcome. The difficulty
of imaging protoplanetary disks is one of resolution, the typical small
angular size of these disks on sky has meant that imaging has been
historically impossible owing to the size of telescopes. The resolution
of the current largest group based telescope is only @xmath in the
H band, insufficient to resolve small scales of inner disks which are
typically only a few mas in diameter. However, over the last few decades
with observatories such as Keck, Hubble, VLT, and ALMA providing larger
and larger telescopes in addition to advanced adaptive optics we have
been able to explore these disks in unprecedented detail.

#### 3.3.1 Scattered Light Observations

As mentioned previously it is thought that most protoplanetary disks
exhibit a flared structure which allows radiation from the central star
to interact with almost all of the disks surface. At the disk surface
small dust grains are well coupled to the gas component and so are
resistant to vertical settling. These small grains are very efficient at
scattering infrared photons. As the disk is optically thick infrared
radiation cannot penetrate deep into the disk, therefore this scattered
light is an excellent probe of gaseous phase structures in the disk
surface.

Figure 3.4 shows scattered light images of the disks around PDS 144N and
MWC 789 from Perrin06 and Laws20 respectively. PDS 144N is almost
completely edge-on such that the central star is completely obscured by
the optically thick midplane of the disk, only the surface layers of the
flared disk are visible to the observer. On the other hand MWC 789 is
more face-on and so more details of the radial disk structure are
visible. In the north-west a large disconnected arc of material and a
stellar companion was detected in the south-west. Other outflows and
arms can be seen along the eastern edge of the disk. As the star is not
obscured by the disk a coronagraph is required to block light from the
central star.

There are several different methods with which we can observe
protoplanetary disks in scattered light. The primary issue of imaging
disks is that light from the star is often significantly brighter than
the scattered light from the disk, which makes observing features within
the disk very difficult. The aim of imaging disks is therefore to remove
the contaminating photon noise from the central star. In the first
instance this is done through the use of a coronagraph, a physical block
in the telescope which blocks the starlight from passing to the
detector. Originally designed to obscure the solar photosphere to allow
for viewing of the solar corona, stellar coronography is now widely used
in the imaging of disks and planets. However, there is often a
significant amount of photon noise which leaks around the coronagraph,
which must be removed through other techniques. Perhaps the most widely
used of these is the process of differential imaging, of which there are
two methods, Polarised Differential Imaging (PDI) and Angular
Differential Imaging (ADI).

Polarised differential imaging relies on the assumption that photons
from the central star are unpolarised while any dust scattering
interaction will polarise the photons. In such a way the polarisation
signal will originate only from this disk and can be used to create an
image of the disk ( Mauron98 ) . This technique is very powerful for
imaging faint disk features as the central star is almost completely
subtracted from the image in comparison to total intensity images (
Avenhaus18 ; Laws20 ) . However, care must be taken with PDI as the
polarisation is heavily dependent on the dust grain size distribution,
composition and the angle of incident radiation. Hence the disk
composition must be at least partially understood to fully interpret PDI
images.

Angular differential imaging involves the capturing of multiple short
exposures of an object as it moves across the sky without correcting for
changes in the field of view. In between different exposures any
asymmetric features will rotate in frame, while centro-symmetric
features such as the PSF will appear not to rotate. As such the images
can be combined in such a way that the central PSF is subtracted from
the final image, leaving just a disk image ( Marois06 ) .

The now widespread use of direct imaging in the study of protoplanetary
disks has allowed us to examine disk structures in unprecedented detail.
Through this we have revealed a host disk gaps, rings, spiral arms and
many other features many of which are direct consequences of active
planet formation processes ( Avenhaus18 ) . However, even these
observations are limited in their resolution ( @xmath for an 8 m
telescope) and cannot resolve detail in the innermost regions of
protoplanetary disks, to explore these regions, other techniques must be
applied.

#### 3.3.2 Sub-mm & Radio Observations

In addition to direct imaging with optical telescopes the development of
long wavelength sub-mm and radio telescope arrays has opened new doors
in high resolution imaging over the past couple of decades. Perhaps the
most prolific facility is the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA)
boasting the highest resolution ( Andrews18 ) .

Rather than relying on the resolving power of a single dish telescope,
these observatories make use of arrays of smaller aperture scopes in a
method known as very long baseline interferometry. For a discussion of
the basics of interferometry at optical wavelengths see Chapter 4. The
resolving power of interferometric arrays is based on the distances
between the antenna rather than the aperture of an individual disk. The
multiple antenna signals are combined and processed to simulate an
individual radio telescope with an effective aperture up to 15 km in
diameter at ALMA.

Many of the most striking images of protoplanetary disks have been
obtained with ALMA such as those shown in Figure 3.5 . In addition to
disk images, ALMA also works at high spectral resolutions, resolving
common lines such as C-O transitions. This allows for the study of the
gaseous disk, in particular disk kinematics, inflows and outflows (
Andrews18 ; Guzman18 ) . Observational studies have unveiled a plethora
of different disk features sometimes unknown and unexpected from theory.

### 3.4 Observed Structures in Protoplanetary Disks

As we have explored, the structures of protoplanetary disks can be
inferred indirectly from analysis of SEDs and spectroscopic
observations, or observed directly in scattered light imaging. From
these observations we have discovered a host of different structures and
substructures with the disk population, in this section I will summarise
of the most important features relevant to the innermost regions of
disks and planet formation in these regions.

#### 3.4.1 Sublimation Fronts

High resolution optical interferometric observations of full
protoplanetary disks are often dominated by flux from around the
sublimation radius. The majority of disks cannot be modelled as wide
extended components, but rather as thin rings around the central star.
This was found to be the case by Lazareff17 who conducted a survey of 51
Herbig AeBe stars using the PIONIER instrument at the VLTI. It was found
that over half of the disks could be successfully modelled using a
ring-like structure. This is due to the high optical depth of the
circumstellar material, where most of the radiation is absorbed,
scattered or re-emitted. As a result most of the disk flux originates
from the very inner-rim of the disk despite the radial extent of
material.

Lazareff17 fit the observational data using simple geometric models,
such as Gaussian and ring distributions. They find that, in the majority
of cases, ring-like distributions provides significantly better @xmath
values that elliptical Gaussian. In addition, when a ring shape is
preferred, it is a wide ring, with @xmath , where @xmath is the
half-light radius. Additional, they constrain the sublimation
temperature to @xmath using radiative transfer modelling, larger than
the @xmath predicted. As explanation for this is not immediately
offered.

The presence of an illuminated inner-rim and a shadowed outer disk has
been shown to be present in a number of objects. However, the exact
shape of the inner-rim is still open for debate. The initial question:
Is the rim sharp of diffuse? is addressed by Kama09 . It was concluded
that the inner-rim is not infinitely sharp, but a diffuse region exists
that can extend to cover a significant fraction of the rim radius. This
region is created through a combination of sublimation, condensation and
backwarming effects. Backwarming occurs when a dust grain cannot cool
into empty space in every direction, so its temperature increases.

The shape of the inner rim has traditionally been defined as a vertical
wall ( Chiang97 ; DAlessio98 ; DAlessio99 ) . A good example of such a
study is Akeson05 , who obtain PTI observations of three YSOs and model
the inner disk with more advance radiative transfer models to fit both
visibilities and SEDs simultaneously. They are able to reproduce
observations using a flared disk with a vertically flat inner wall.
However, they also require the presence of material interior to the dust
sublimation rim to explain their observations. This material could exist
in the form of a hot gaseous disk or very refractive dust grain species
such as Ca-Al-Ti bearing compounds which are well characterised from
chondrite meteroites within our own solar system ( Lodders03 ) .

However, this has been shown to be a poor fit to many observations, as
the strong asymmetries predicted by flat rim models have never been
observed in inclined objects ( monnier06 ) . This lead to the
consideration of older models of sublimation rims; Dullemond02 proposed
several different structures dependent on their density distribution as
a function of radius. For the case where optical depth is high, the
structure is similar to that of a simple ’disk with a hole’. At large
radii that disk adopts a highly flared shape, while nearer to the
sublimation radius the dust becomes superheated and so becomes
’puffed-up’ with the rest of the disk in shadow if sufficiently
optically thick. The degree of shadowing depends upon the position of
the flaring and the optical thickness along the different disk axes.
These structures provide a detailed and complex way of modelling disk
geometries, one that requires sophisticated radiative transfer
modelling, that can produce much better fits to the observed
visibilities than basic geometric modelling.

A commonly used prescription for inner-rim morphology is that of
Isella05 . They argue that the shape of the inner rim is controlled by a
very large vertical density gradient, through the dependence of grain
evaporation temperature on gas pressure density as described in
section 2.3.1. This results in a curved rim, rather than a vertical
wall. The exact shape of the inner-rim can still vary slightly from
object to object, however, most modern interpretations are based upon a
curved and puffed-up rim which casts the extended disk into shadow.
However, to further complicate matters, as more disks are observed more
discontinuous, asymmetric inner-rims are discovered, and modelling those
brings its own set of challenges.

#### 3.4.2 Rings and Gaps

Gaps within the radial structure of protoplanetary disks are the best
signature available for the detection of planets within the disk beyond
direct imaging. They can form at any position within the disk, including
within the inner astronomical unit, and can vary greatly in size.

If a planet forms within a circumstellar disk, it is reasonable to
assume that tidal forces can clear the orbit of the planet. For such a
phenomenon to occur, that Roche radius of the planet must be comparable
to the thickness of the gas disk, equating to typically masses somewhere
between Saturn and Jupiter ( Goldreich80 ) . Indeed one of the
definitions of a planet by the IAU is that its orbit has been cleared of
debris. jang08 initially the shape of a dimple in the disk created by
gravitational perturbations of a planet, however, they did not
anticipate that tidal forces could clear a large gap in the disk, as
shown in the hydrodynamical simulations of Bate03 . These gaps were much
larger than the dimples and if well resolved allow for determination of
the mass of the planet. However, care must be taken when interpreting
disk gaps as planet induced as it has been shown that magneto-rotational
or gravitational instabilities can also create gaps under the correct
circumstances ( Johansen09 ; Takahashi16 ) .

These gaps invariably create a second rim, the far edge of which can
become thermally heated and puffed up. In flared disks, this creates a
second ring of bright flux which can be observed in the same way as
inner-rim, through interferometry ( Varniere06 ) . Alternatively for a
flatter disk, the far edge of the gap will remain in the shadow of the
inner-rim and so not be visible ( Wolf02 ) .

With recent improvements in the spatial resolution of instruments, an
increasing number of circumstellar disks have been shown to contain gaps
in their morphology. Perhaps the most famous example is that of HL Tau (
ALMA15 ) shown in the left of Figure 3.5 . HL Tau demonstrates a
remarkable series of bright and dark concentric rings though to be
induced by the planet formation process. Calvet02 discuss the
observation of gap within a highly evolved disk that is theorised to be
caused by a planet within @xmath of the central star. Another example is
provided by Andrews16 in the form of ALMA images of the YSO TW Hya where
similar concentric rings are found between 1-6 au. Various scenarios are
proposed for the occurrence of these rings, some occur at temperatures
that may be associated with the condensation fronts of major volatile
species ( Zhang15 ; Okuzumi16 ) , while others may be the consequence of
magnetised disk evolution. However, a particularly dark annulus located
at 1 au could indicate interactions between the disk and young planets.

#### 3.4.3 Asymmetries

Dramatic asymmetric features have been captured across a wide range of
protoplanetary disks. The most spectacular demonstrations of asymmetric
features are found in the outer disk when imaged directly or with sub-mm
interferometry ( Garufi17 ; Avenhaus18 ; vanderMarel21 ) . Asymmetries
are found in the form of spiral arms, arcs, or large blobs of material,
which have a variety of possible causes.

Several objects have been observed with string asymmetries thought to
arise from dust trapping mechanisms. Examples of this include Oph IRS 48
and V1247 Orionis ( vanderMarel13 ; Kraus17 , respectively) where dust
trapping leads to the formation of a huge ’blob’ or arc like features on
one side of the disk. These are thought to form when dust is trapped
within local gas pressure maxima in both the radial and azimuthal
direction. The high local gas pressure prevents both the inward drift of
dust and potentially destructive collisions, such an effect is more
efficient for larger grains as the small grains are better coupled to
the gas. The origin of these local pressure maxima is not fully
understood, but potential causes include the appearance of a ’dead zone’
within the disk ( Regaly12 ) or vortices created by a substellar
companion/planet ( Pinilla12 ) . The efficiency of the dust trapping in
these regions is such that it has been touted as a potential planet
formation mechanism.

Another commonly observed feature in the outer disk is one or more
spiral arms such as HD 142527, HD 34700A, AB Aur and SU Aur ( Avenhaus17
; Monnier19 ; Boccaletti20 ; Ginski21 , respectively) . Spiral arms a
known to be more common in larger Herbig AeBe stars than their lower
mass T Tauri counterparts which fuels the theories regard spiral arm
formation ( Avenhaus18 ) . Herbig disks tend to be more massive, raising
the possibility of gravitational instabilities, Herbigs also have a high
binarity fraction meaning the dynamical influence of a secondary
component must be considered ( Casassus15 ; Perez15 ) . Most of the
observed disks are not thought to be massive enough to experience
gravitational instabilities, making this an unlikely scenario (
Vorobyov10 ) .

In addition to outer disk studies, inner disk asymmetries have been
observed in several disks to date, looking back at the survey of Herbig
AeBe stars by Lazareff17 . They find numerous candidates with asymmetric
disks from geometric fitting, which are modelled as simple asymmetric,
skewed rings. However, no specific explanations are offered for the
presence of these asymmetries as more information is required on
specific objects.

Work by Kluska16 reveals an extreme case of disk asymmetry in the
material around MWC 158. A large asymmetry on one side of the disk is
shown to move across the different epochs of interferometric data,
through a combination of image reconstruction and geometric fitting. The
causes of this asymmetry are explained in a number of ways. The most
obvious cause is a close companion in orbit around the star. A binary
system is shown to successfully reproduce the strong closure phase
signal of the data, however, none of the geometric binary fits alone
were able to reproduce the data, and fitting of circular Keplerian
orbits proved unsuccessful.

Other possible explanations are also proposed, several years earlier
Fernandes09 discussed two possible scenarios for MWC 158. Firstly, the
formation of a one-armed spiral due to matter ejection from a hot-spot
on the stellar surface ( Kervella14 ) is shown to sufficiently explain
the shifted emission features and the changes in radial velocities seen
in the photospheric lines. Secondly, a shell ejection episode that can
carry dust and gas away from the central star is capable of reproducing
the photometric variability observed in the different epochs of
observations ( Fernandes11 ; Fernandes12 ) .

The presence of disk asymmetries has been shown to be caused by a
variety of interesting factors, that can greatly affect disk morphology.
Perhaps the most interesting, also the easiest to explain, is that
companions within the disk have the potential to create many of the
observed structures.

## Chapter 4 Introduction to Interferometry

  “It is obvious from what has gone before that it would be hopeless to
  attempt to solve the question of the motion of the solar system by
  observations of optical phenomena at the surface of the earth.”

  — A. Michelson & E. Morley spacing

Interferometry has truly entered its golden age over the past few
decades. We have witnessed the dramatic transformation of what was a
fringe observational technique to a mainstream method of discovery.
Interferometry provides us with the highest possible resolution view of
the universe, which no single telescope can ever hope to rival. In
recent years this has culminated in the first image of a super massive
black hole in another galaxy taken by the event horizon telescope (
EHT19 ) . An interferometric array spanning the whole Earth.

### 4.1 Origins of Interferometry

The property of light to interfere with itself was first scientifically
described by Thomas Young in the late 18th, early 19th century, by
resurrecting the century old theory that light is indeed a wave. Young
was able to describe the double-slit phenomenon whereby light from a
single source passes through two narrow slits and is projected onto a
screen and a series of light and dark bands appear ( Young02 ) . Light
from the two slits will interfere either constructively when in phase or
destructively when out of phase, producing an interference pattern of
bright and dark fringes on the screen. The spacing and contrast of these
fringes can be described solely by the characteristics of the source and
slits. It was from this very simple experiment that interferometry was
born.

The simple setup of Young’s double slit experiment is shown in Figure
4.1 where coherent light of wavelength @xmath is incident upon a double
slit of separation @xmath . At a distance of @xmath is a screen upon
which an interference pattern is formed with bright constructive peaks
at angle @xmath from the normal, where @xmath is the mode of the peak.
The relationship can be described as @xmath , this can be expanded to
include the separation between the peaks as @xmath and the small angle
separation can be induced.

One of the earliest uses of interferometry in astronomy, lies within
attempts to discover the now absurd luminiferous aether. The aether was
the postulated medium for the propagation of light since the 17th
century, where it was invoked to explain the movement of light through
apparently empty space. The aether was theorised to be directional,
hence light travelling in different directions would exhibit a phase
shift. It was on this basis which Albert Michelson and Edward Morley
designed an experiment to detect the luminiferous aether in 1887. The
idea was simple, to compare a source of light with itself after being
sent in different directions via a beam splitter and series of mirrors.
The recombining of the two beams of light would create an interference
pattern of bright and dark fringes. The presence of the luminiferous
aether ’wind’ would cause a change in the phase of the beams leading to
a shift in the fringe pattern. No such shift in the fringe pattern was
observed, and in later years the theory of a luminiferous aether was
completely discredited. However, the foundations for the first
interferometer had been laid.

The first observations interfering light from celestial objects were
conducted in 1891 and used to measure the diameter of Jupiter’s moons (
Michelson91 ) ; only a few years later did Michelson, following the
suggestion of Hippolyte Fizeau, propose a stellar interferometer in
order to determine the diameter of stars ( Michelson21 ) . The first
such design was installed at the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson
observatory in California/USA. The geometry of the system consisted of
four mirrors as shown in Figure 4.2 , M1 and M2 collect light from the
primary telescope mirror and are separated by a variable length @xmath .
The M3 and M4 mirrors redirect the light onto a detector. In this way
light from same star can create an interference pattern. The movable
primary mirrors allow for the baseline to be increased or decreased in
order to find the point of maximum or minimum fringe contrast. By
finding the baseline separation at which the fringes disappeared
completely Michelson was able to calculate the diameter of Betelgeuse to
be @xmath ( Michelson21 ) . His measurement was surprisingly accurate
given the only detector of fringe contrast was the human eye with modern
estimates ranging from @xmath to @xmath depending on observing
wavelength ( Dolan16 ) .

The major advantage of astronomical interferometry is the very high
achievable resolution. For a single dish telescope, the maximum
resolution is defined by the Rayleigh criterion which states @xmath
where @xmath is the diameter of the telescope aperture. For the single
dish telescope, two point sources are described as resolved when the
principle diffraction maximum of the first point source coincides with
the principle diffraction minimum of the second. In interferometry, the
same two point sources are considered resolved when their fringe
contrast is equivalent to zero, this occurs at @xmath where @xmath is
the separation between the two telescopes. At this separation the two
fringe packets created will be exactly out of phase, creating
destructive interference. As such, the resolution of an interferometric
array is independent of the apertures of the individual and instead
depends of the distance between telescopes. This allows astronomer to
achieve unprecedentedly high angular resolution.

The first successful multi-aperture stellar interferometer was the
Interféromètre à 2 Télescopes (I2T) ( Labeyrie75 ) . Initially located
at Nice observatory and later moved to CERGA in southern France, it
consisted of 2 small aperture telescopes separated by a 12 m baseline.
Fringe tracking was done manually using a micrometer screw to form
fringes on a photon-counting television camera. First fringes were
obtained on Vega in 1974 ( Labeyrie75 ) and has since been used for a
wide array of science (see Koechlin88 , and reference therein) .
However, its primary purpose was for the design and implementation of
new technologies and techniques for creating modern interferometric
arrays.

A modern Michelson interferometer is significantly more complex than
Michelson’s original design despite using the same basic principles.
Figure 4.3 is a schematic of a simple two telescope interferometer.
Light is collected from the two telescopes and brought into a central
facility via vacuum pipes in order to remove the effects of atmospheric
diffraction. Due to the large separation of the telescopes there is a
significant delay in the time taken for light to arrive at one telescope
with respect to another, making it impossible to form interferometric
fringes. Such a delay must be compensated before the beams are combined,
this is done through delay lines. Delay lines consist of mirrors mounted
on carts which can move up and down rails to increase or decrease the
optical path length of an individual telescope. The light is then passed
into a beam combination instrument which interferes the light creating
fringes which are read on a detector.

In addition to Michelson stellar interferometers and a small number of
observatories use a technique known as Fizeau interferometry, which does
not require corrective delay lines. These facilities are more similar in
design to the original Michelson-Morley experiment. Light is collected
from multiple telescopes at a sparse aperture telescope which serves as
the beam combiner which focus the combined light onto a detector. An
example of a Fizeau interferometer is the Large Binocular Telescope
Interferometer (LBTI) ( Rothberg20 ) .

The setup of a beam combiner instrument varies dramatically between
different instruments which are capable of different spectral
resolutions, wavelength modes and sensitivities. A brief summary of the
current generation of facilities and instruments is provided in the
following section.

### 4.2 Overview of Interferometric Facilities

Since the first observations using the Mt Wilson stellar interferometer
multiple facilities dedicated to optical interferometry have sprung up
around the world. The two most prolific interferometric sites are CHARA
and VLTI, the key characteristics of which I discuss in this section. In
addition, I discuss the KI and PTI sites which have direct relevance to
the work in this thesis. This section is dedicated to optical
observatories, for a summary on radio/sub-mm interferometric sites see
Omont03 ; Sargent04 .

#### 4.2.1 Chara

On the same site as Michelson’s original stellar interferometer now
stands the CHARA (Centre for High Angular Resolution Astronomy) array (
Brummelaar05 ) . CHARA consists of six telescopes of 1 metre in diameter
in a fixed Y-shaped configuration. This provides 15 baselines ranging
from 34 - 331 meters in length and up to 20 possible closure phase
triangles (see Section 4.3.2 ). Light is passed from the telescopes to
the centre beam combination facility with delay lines 40 metres long,
allowing up to 80 metre of delay to be added. Such delay lines are
particularly short for the long baselines of CHARA, but this is
addressed using fixed delay mirrors known as PoPs (Pipes of Pan) which
can easily add large amounts of delay in vacuum.

There are currently 5 instruments located within the beam combining
laboratory operating across the visible and NIR.

-   CLASSIC and CLIMB are open air, broadband instruments optimised for
    sensitivity across the J, H and K band. CLASSIC is the original
    two-beam combiner at the array, while CLIMB can combine light from
    up to 3 telescopes ( Brummelaar13 ) .

-   Precision Astronomical Visible Observations (PAVO) ( Ireland08 ) is
    a 3-telescope visible beam combiner. PAVO spatially modulates
    fringes in a pupil plane before dispersing them with an integrated
    field unit, this allows PAVO to utilise the full multi-r0 aperture
    of the CHARA array over a standard @xmath bandwidth. PAVO typically
    relies on fringe tracking from CLIMB in the NIR, allowing for high
    precision sensitivity-optimised observations.

-   The Visible spEctroGraph and polArimeter (VEGA) ( Mourard09 ) is a 3
    telescope combiner designed for high resolution
    spectro-interferometry and can provide spectral resolutions of R =
    6000-30,0000 across the visible wavelengths of 480-850 nm. The short
    operating wavelength of VEGA also makes it the highest spatial
    resolution of the array, down to 0.3 mas on the longest baseline.
    The successor SPICA (Stellar Parameters and Images with a Cophased
    Array) will combine light from all 6-telescopes while fringe
    tracking in the NIR.

-   Finally, MIRC-X (Michigan InfraRed Combiner-eXeter) ( Anugu20 ) is
    currently the only 6 telescope infrared beam combiner in the world,
    allowing it to make use of all 15 baselines and 20 closure phase
    triangles simultaneously. MIRC-X operates in the H band with
    low/medium spectral resolutions between R = 22-190 and is equipped
    with a revolutionary sub-electron noise and fast-frame rate camera
    allowing for very precise and sensitive observations. A deeper
    discussion of MIRC-X and associated engineering activities can be
    found it Chapter 5.

#### 4.2.2 Vlti

The other primary interferometric facility is located at the European
Southern Observatories Very Large Telescope (VLT) at Paranal, Chile. The
array consists of multiple telescopes used for a wide variety of
astronomical purposes, just one of which is interferometry. Light can be
collected from either the 4 static 8.2m unitary telescopes (UTs) or 4
movable 1.8m auxiliary telescopes (ATs) allowing for optimisation of
either sensitivity or uv coverage. What the VLTI lacks in number and
length of baselines (maximum baseline length of 110m) it makes up for in
sensitivity with significantly better limiting magnitudes than CHARA
instrument. This is primarily owing to larger telescopes and a fully
operation adaptive optics system.

There are currently 3 instruments in the beam combination laboratory
operating at different wavelengths and spectral modes. PIONIER
(Precision Integrated-Optics Near-infrared Imaging ExpeRiment) (
JBLB2011 ) is a H band 4 telescope combiner which operates at low
spectral resolutions providing good sensitivity and very precise
visibility and closure phase measurements. Secondly, GRAVITY ( GRAVITY17
) is a K band instrument operating at both low and high spectral
resolutions. It can provide exquisite precision, with relative
astrometric accuracy down to @xmath and is capable of resolving spectral
lines for spectro-interferometric observations. GRAVITY is equipped with
a built-in fringe tracking system making it extremely sensitive, ideal
for observing very faint targets. Finally, MATISSE ( Lopez14 ) is a MIR
multi-wavelength instrument which is capable of L, M and N band
observations allowing for maximum angular resolution ( @xmath ) between
3.5 and 8mas depending on wavelength. MATISSE is also capable of both
high and low spectral resolution observations, allowing for both faint
target work and spectro interferometry. Work is underway to allow for
GRAVITY to be used as a fringe tracker for MATISSE to allow for even
fainter observations in the MIR in a project known as GRAV4MAT ( Gonte16
) .

#### 4.2.3 Other Facilities

In addition to CHARA and VLTI there are several historic, current, and
future interferometric sites around the world including IOTA (
Carleton94 ) , SUSI ( Davis99 ) , NPOI ( vanBelle20 ) , and MROI (
Buscher13 ) amongst others. However, I will only discuss the sites
relevant to the scientific work contained in this thesis, the Keck
interferometer and Palomar Testbed Interferometer.

##### 4.2.3.1 Pti

The Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI) ( Colavita99 ) was originally
intended as a test site for the Keck interferometer, but became a widely
used facility in its own right. PTI consisted of three 40cm telescopes
which could be combined pairwise on baselines up to 110m in length. It
operated in both the H and K bands with no spectral resolution. First
fringes were obtained in 1995, and the site remained in operation until
2008, many of the learnings and techniques were later adopted in the
construction of the Keck interferometer.

##### 4.2.3.2 Ki

The Keck observatory at the summit of Mauna Kea Hawaii consists of two
of the largest telescopes in the world, each with 10m apertures.
Operational from 2003 to 2012, the Keck Interferometer (KI) ( Colavita13
; Eisner14 ) combined light from the two telescopes situated 84m apart
in a central laboratory. A variety of instruments allowed KI to operate
in H, K and L band modes with an additional nulling interferometry
instrument. The sheer size of the telescope apertures allowed for high
sensitivity observations of faint objects.

### 4.3 Observables in Interferometry

The process of extracting observables from interferometric data is
significantly more complex than most other areas of astronomy. One
cannot simply measure the flux in a few pixels or ogle a directly imaged
nebula, an often-painstaking processes must be endured to extract any
useful information for the interference fringes available.

There are two key aspects of an observed interference pattern, the
fringe amplitude and fringe phase. The fringe amplitude is simply a
measure of the fringe contrast between the light and dark regions and is
described as:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the visibility amplitude (also known as the Michelson
visibility) and @xmath and @xmath are the minimum and maximum intensity
of the interference pattern. From this equation it follows that
visibility is normalised between 0 and 1 and a decreased fringe contrast
corresponds to a lower visibility and greater fringe contract to a
higher visibility. The physical interpretation of visibilities is
described below in section 4.3.1 . In Figure 4.4 , the fringes on the
left have a visibility amplitude equal to one.

Fringe phase is a measure of the location of the central fringe with
respect to the location of zero optical path difference (OPD), The phase
offset is measured in radians, with a phase of @xmath corresponding to a
whole fringe period. The right panel of Figure 4.4 depicts a fringe
panel of zero phase as a solid line as the central fringe located at the
position of zero OPD, the dashed line has been shifted by @xmath
radians.

#### 4.3.1 Complex Visibilities

Visibilities are the most basic measurement available to any
interferometer. An interference fringe has two properties a visibility
amplitude and a visibility phase, both contained within a complex
visibility measurement. As described above visibility amplitude is
simply a measure of the fringe contrast between the bright and dark
regions of the interference pattern between two telescopes.

However, this description of visibilities does not describe the
brightness of the astronomical object being observed. In order to
explore this the Van Cittert-Zernike theorem ( Cittert34 ; Zernike38 )
provides a physical description of visibilities. In short, it states
that the Fourier transform of the intensity distribution (object
geometry) of a distant, incoherent source is equal to its complex
visibility. Mathematically this corresponds to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath represent the angular coordinates on the sky and
@xmath and @xmath are coordinates in Fourier space describing the
baseline @xmath and @xmath , and therefore the spatial frequencies of
the brightness distribution. One can see that this equation can very
simple be re-written as the Fourier transform:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

This simple relation allows for information about the intensity
distribution of the target to be directly extracted from visibility
measurements.

The difficulty with visibility measurements lies in their analysis, as
understanding measurements taken in Fourier space is not an intuitive
process. It is only though inverse modelling or more complex image
reconstruction that an appreciation can be gained for the original
intensity distribution of the object. A description of modelling
techniques, including visibility modelling can be found in Section 4.4 .

#### 4.3.2 Closure Phases

While the measure of fringe phase is mathematically relatively simple,
the measurement of phases in astronomy is a notoriously difficult
endeavor owing to the presence of a turbulent atmosphere, mirror
reflectivity, local scintillation and other effects. Turbulence above
any individual telescope, in addition to differing optical systems will
introduce a phase delay that is specific to that telescope. As such the
phases measured by two separate telescopes will be significantly
different, even if the telescopes are only separated by a few meters.
This will manifest as a phase shift in the measured phase of a detected
fringe.

However, Jennison58 introduced a method of calculating a reliable phase
measurement based on a closed triangle of telescopes. Given three
telescopes, A, B and C, where a phase delay is introduced above
telescope B. This will induce a phase shift in the fringes between
telescopes A-B and an equal but opposite phase shift between B-C. Hence,
one can sum up the phase differences of A-B, B-C and C-A. In this way,
an atmospheric phase delay above any single telescope will be subtracted
from the final phase measurement. This closed triangle of telescopes
leads to the name of closure phases. The closure phase @xmath can
therefore be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath represents the measured Fourier phase for the baseline
connecting telescopes A and B. Closure phases were first carried out at
optical wavelengths in aperture masking experiments ( Baldwin86 ;
Haniff87 ; Readhead88 ) . The first facility to apply closure phase
techniques to optical interferometry was the Cambridge Optical Aperture
Synthesis Telescope (COAST) facility in 1996 ( Baldwin96 ) . Since then
closure phase measurements have become standard practice for many
interferometric facilities.

These closure phases encode the spatial structure of the source, in
particular deviations from point symmetry. A resolved point source or
other point symmetric object will have closure phases equivalent to
@xmath or @xmath . In addition, an unresolved object cannot exhibit
non-zero closure phases. Any deviation from 0 or 180 degrees implies an
asymmetric intensity distribution. Closure phases are therefore
immensely powerful observables for precision astrometry and imaging
techniques.

#### 4.3.3 Differential Phases

Another method of extracting phase information from interference is the
derivation of differential phases. Differential phases are simply a
measure of the change in the object phase between adjacent spectral
channels and generally rely on the presence of emission/absorption lines
within the spectrum of the object. When looking at individual emission
lines, the line width is very narrow compared to the bandwidth of the
emission frequency. As such, the phase error introduced by the
atmosphere is expected to be nearly constant across the spectral line (
Monnier07 ) . Thus, it is possible to measure the visibility phase of a
spectral line relative to the continuum by subtracting the continuum
phase measured on either side of the spectral line.

Differential phases can be a powerful tool in interferometry as they
allow for the study of kinematics within the objects, by selecting
spectral lines that trace such processes. As an example, the @xmath
emission line in the K band is thought to inflow/outflow processes in
protoplanetary disks (see Hone17 ; Kraus12b ) .

While differential visibilities can be very useful, they rely on the
presence of strong, emission or absorption lines. In order to spectrally
resolves such lines, high spectral resolution observations are required
which limits the sensitivity of interferometry.

### 4.4 Geometric Modelling

The understanding of interferometric variables is not intuitive in the
way that many astronomical variables are. The ability to visualise
geometric structures in their Fourier space is reserved only for those
who have spent many years in interferometric studies. The analysis of
the data is therefore intrinsically inverse, such that models are
adapted in order to fit the data. Visibilities are often expressed as
function of baseline length or a combination of baseline and
observational wavelength known as spatial frequency, given by @xmath ,
were @xmath is the spatial frequency. These visibility profiles can
provide direct information such as the characteristic size and basic
morphology of an object. In order to interpret visibility profiles
quantitatively, analytic models must be applied to model simple
structures such as point sources, ring and Gaussian brightness
distribution. The brightness distribution of these models can then be
Fourier transformed in order to extract visibilities as shown in
Equation 4.2 .

It is often necessary to combine two or more such models in order to
effectively model an object, for example a point source and ring in
order to model a star and disk system. In this case, the linearity
property of Fourier transforms can be employed to compute model
visibilities:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, the visibility of a complex brightness distribution is the
normalised sum of the visibilities of the individual components that
make up that brightness distribution. In addition to the multi-component
nature, most objects are also inclined with respect to the observer,
meaning the orientation must be considered. These projection effects
must be accounted for by de-projecting the baselines. A complete
description of geometric modelling of visibilities is given by Berger03b
, which also contains mathematical expressions for commonly used models.

Geometric modelling is a very powerful technique that allows an observer
to get an appreciation for object morphology from relatively few data
points. The more complex the geometry of a system the greater the number
of observables required to disentangle analytic models. As shown in
Figure 4.5 the defining feature between different model’s visibility
profiles is only apparent at longer baselines, while projection effects
require a more expanse uv coverage to fully interpret.

Geometric modelling is particularly useful for the interpretation of
smaller data sets of simple objects. However, for studying finer details
and more complex datasets, such modelling is not always sufficient as
the models lack robust 3-dimensional information. In order to study
greater details, either more complex models are needed through radiative
transfer work or model independent processes such as image
reconstruction must be employed.

### 4.5 Image Reconstruction

The reconstruction of an interferometric image is not as simple as
performing an inverse Fourier transform on the data. The observables of
optical interferometry provide an incomplete sampling of the uv plane
owing to the discrete possible baselines and position angles. The voids
of the uv plane must therefore be filled in with assumptions. Additional
problems arise from the lack of Fourier phase information, with only
closure phases available. As such, image reconstruction becomes a
complex compromise between fitting available data and keeping the image
as regularised or simple as possible. However, used in a careful and
considered way, image reconstruction is a powerful, model independent
analytical tool. In this section I shall describe the basic process of
image reconstruction and outline some of the commonly used algorithms.

#### 4.5.1 Basic Principles

Because of the incomplete sampling of the uv plane, the measured data
can be thought of as the true, complete distribution @xmath multiplied
by some sampling function @xmath . To this we can apply the convolution
theorem to state that the Fourier transform of the sampled distribution
(also known as the dirty map @xmath ) is equal to the convolution of the
Fourier transform of the true source distribution image @xmath with the
Fourier transform of the sampling function (also known as the dirty beam
@xmath ). For the cases where the full complex visibility is known:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath represents convolution and @xmath indicates the Fourier
transform. The process of obtaining an approximation of the true source
distribution image therefore becomes a problem of deconvolution of the
dirty map by the dirty beam. However in optical interferometry, the full
Fourier phase is not a known quantity, as we are limited to only closure
phase measurements. Image reconstruction algorithms can be designed
following the same inverse problem approach.

The primary factor hampering deconvolution is the sparse sampling of
spatial frequencies meaning that fitting data alone does not define a
unique image solution. Such a problem can be solved by an inverse
problem method by imposing a priori constraints to select the most
likely image among all those which are consistent with the data. The
requirements for such priors are that they must smoothly interpolate
across the uv plane while avoiding the highest frequencies beyond the
diffraction limit. These prior constraints can be monitored within the
term @xmath of image @xmath which measures the agreement between the
image and the priors, the lower the value the better the fit. The term
@xmath is often called regularisation, the two most commonly used
algorithms are MEM and CLEAN

Maximum entropy methods (MEM) are based on the idea of obtaining the
least informative image which is consistent with the data. This is the
same as maximising the entropy within the image in order to maintaining
simplicity. This amounts to a minimising of the term @xmath where the
entropy @xmath measures the informational content of an image @xmath .
One of the most common expressions considered for this is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is some default image, either a flat, a previous
reconstruction or a lower resolution image of the same set. The
subscript @xmath refers to the @xmath pixel in the image ( Thiebaut17 )
. In order to enforce some correlation between close pixels in the
image, some averaging or smoothing linear operator is usually chose to
prevent truly maximum entropy.

The CLEAN algorithm is another method employed which favours images with
a limited number of significant pixels to attempt to preserve simplicity
( Hogbom74 ) . This method is iterative and follows the prescription:
Given a dataset as a dirty image, the location of a point source which
best fits the data is found. The model image is then updated by a
fraction of this intensity. This fraction is then subtracted from the
dirty image and the procedure is repeated with this updated dirty image.
When the level of the residuals in the image become smaller that a given
noise threshold the model image is convolved with a Gaussian PSF to set
the resolution of the uv plane. Once most point sources have been
removed, the residual dirty image is essentially due to the remaining
extended source. Adding the residual dirty image to the clean image
produces a final image consisting of compact sources plus smooth
extended components.

#### 4.5.2 Reconstruction Algorithms

Over the past few decades several algorithms have been developed to
reconstruct images from interferometric data. Notably MiRA ( Thiebaut13
) and BSMEN ( Buscher94 ) . MiRA or the Multi-aperture Image
Reconstruction Algorithm uses the minimisation of both @xmath and @xmath
, where @xmath measures the agreement between the model and the data,
making use of a very wide range of regularisation techniques including
MEM, smoothness and total variation. As MiRA is purely based on an
inverse problem approach it can cope with incomplete data sets, such as
those missing phase information.

BSMEM is the Bi-spectrum maximum entropy method and uses MEM to
regularise the problem of image reconstruction to the complex
bispectrum. The strength of BSMEM is that it makes no attempt to convert
data into complex visibilities. As such it can handle any type of
missing data, including closure phases.

In order to autonomise the process of reconstruction as much as
possible, the different algorithms have been implemented into pipelines.
One such pipeline is the Poly-Chromatic Image reconstruction Pipeline
(PIRP), as outlined by Kluska14 . PIRP primarily makes use of MiRA for
image retrieval, but adds the Semi-Parametric Approach for image
Reconstruction of Chromatic Objects (SPARCO) which parameterises the
chromaticity of the stellar emission from the interferometric data
across the spectrum to reconstruct images based on different
temperatures producing different wavelength. It is shown that using
SPARCO improves the fit of the image to the data by a factor of 9 using
this method ( Kluska14 ) , thus proving it is highly effective at
accurately reproducing the data.

## Chapter 5 Engineering Activities with MIRCX ^(†) ^(†) Parts of this
chapter are published in Labdon2020b

A significant portion of my work during the course of this PhD has been
dedicated to instrumentation activities in conjunction with the both the
CHARA array and the MIRC-X instrument. My instrumentation work can be
split into two projects. Firstly, to expand the operational wavelength
of MIRC-X to include the J band in addition to the H band. The first
scientific results of this work are described in section Chapter 8. In
this section, I shall describe this instrumentation work. Secondly, the
development of a next generation baseline solution for CHARA in order to
provide more efficient observations for all instruments.

### 5.1 J band Interferometry with MIRC-X

The Michigan Infrared Combiner (MIRC) was a six-telescope infrared beam
combiner at the CHARA telescope array ( Monnier04 ) , the world’s
largest baseline interferometer in the visible/infrared, located at the
Mount Wilson Observatory in California. In the summers of 2017 and 2018
MIRC underwent significant upgrades, with the newly commissioned
instrument being named MIRC-X. The commissioning of MIRC-X occurred in
two phases, the first of these phases involved the implementation of an
ultra-fast, ultra-low read noise near-infrared camera ( Anugu18 ) and an
overhaul of the MIRC control software. The second phase involved the
replacement of the optical fibres and beam combination element in
addition to the commissioning of polarisation controllers. A detailed
description of the upgraded MIRC-X instrument can be found in Kraus18 ;
Anugu20 .

Over the past 15 years MIRC/MIRC-X has produced many outstanding results
in a variety of areas of astrophysics including the imaging of stellar
surfaces of rapid rotators, eclipsing binary systems and star spots on
the surfaces of highly magnetically active stars. ( Monnier12 ;
Roettenbacher17 ; Schaefer19 ; Chiavassa20 ) . In more recent years, the
upgrades have allowed for observations of young stellar objects (YSO)
with all six telescopes for the first time ( Kraus20 ; Labdon20 ) and
for high precision single-field astrometry for the detection of Hot
Jupiter objects in binary systems ( Gardner20 ) .

Historically MIRC-X has only operated in the H band, however, one of the
ultimate aims of the upgrades was to conduct dual H and J band
observations. The J band ( @xmath ) is a relatively untapped resource in
long-baseline interferometry, but one with huge potential for scientific
discoveries. It allows access to the photosphere in giant and
super-giant stars relatively free from opacities of molecular bands. In
addition, the J band traces the warmest and smallest scales of
protoplanetary disks, where accretion and viscous heating take place.
Finally, the J band allows for higher angular resolution observations
than near and mid-IR (as @xmath ) allowing us to probe the smallest
scales of astrophysical objects.

In this section I present a summary of the work done to commission the J
band for observations at the MIRC-X instrument. In section 5.1.2 I
discuss the J band specific hardware improvements required, while in
sections 5.1.3 I summarise the corresponding software developments
undertaken in this endeavor. In section 5.1.4 I discuss the changes and
updates needed in order to reduce and calibrate the first scientific
observations.

#### 5.1.1 MIRC-X Filters

Beyond the major instrument upgrades in 2017 and 2018 mentioned in the
introduction, various other hardware requirements were needed in order
to conduct J band observations. In this section I discuss this work and
the design decisions involved. Operating in standard observing mode
MIRC-X employs an H band filter with central wavelength @xmath and
bandwidth @xmath . However, in order to observe in the J band a new
filter which extends to a lower wavelength regime must be employed.
However, this is hampered owing to the presence of a metrology laser at
CHARA. This laser operates at @xmath and is responsible for providing
accurate metrology of the delay line cart position, a vital role at any
optical interferometer. This laser wavelength lies in the upper J band
and so will saturate the detector in addition to contaminating stellar
flux.

This was overcome with addition of a notch or band-stop filter. These
filters reject/attenuate signals in a specific wavelength band and pass
the signals above and below this band. In this way I can reject light
from the CHARA metrology laser and accept stellar contributions from the
H band J bands above and below this respectively. The theoretical and
measured characteristics of the notch filter I employed is shown in
Figure 5.1 . The rejection factor at the metrology laser wavelength was
found to be sufficient as no laser signal is seen on the detector,
indicating it to be below the level of the background noise.

#### 5.1.2 Longitudinal Dispersion Compensation

Long-baseline optical interferometry poses unique engineering
challenges. One of the most demanding aspects is the requirement for
optical path length compensation. The path length of the various light
beams are not identical for each telescope, owing to the position of the
scope and position of the astronomical object on the sky. As such, the
path difference much be corrected in order to ensure coherence for
interferometric fringes. At CHARA this is done using two methods, the
first is to employ fixed amounts of delay which can be moved in and out
of the light path using retractable mirrors. These are known as Pipes of
Pan or PoPs. The second method is to employ carts affixed to delay lines
which track the geometric phase difference as a stars moves across the
sky. The difficulty with the second method is that it is very difficult
to achieve in a vacuum, due to the size and number of moving parts. This
introduces a large amount of air into the system, potentially up to
@xmath difference in air path between the beams. This air leads to
atmospheric, chromatic dispersion.

In standard single band observing, this does not pose a problem due to
the small wavelength range. However, in dual band observations this
become a major problem. If delay line carts are tracking H band fringes,
the J band light will be incoherent due to chromatic dispersion and
fringes will be severely reduced contrast to the point of being
un-observable. Therefore a method of correcting for atmospheric
dispersion must be employed. At CHARA, this is in the form of
Longitudinal Dispersion Compensators (LDCs).

The LDCs consist of wedges of glass that can move in and out of the beam
to increase or decrease the thickness of glass in the beam path. The
characteristics of the LDCs are described in great detail in Berger03
when the LDCs were commissioned in order to enable simultaneous
near-infrared (NIR) observations with the CLIMB instrument and visible
observations with PAVO ( Ireland08 ) . Despite not being designed for
use between the H and J bands, the choice of Schott-10 glass proved
ideal for use with MIRC-X. Shown in Figure 5.2 is the expected
dispersion between the NIR wavebands and the expected linear movement of
the glass to successfully correct for this. The thickness of glass
required for a given air path can be calculated using

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here, @xmath is the thickness of glass, @xmath is the air path in
meters, @xmath is the refractive index of air and @xmath is the
refractive index of the LDC glass. The @xmath and @xmath terms are the
derivatives of the air and glass refractive indicies respectively.
@xmath and @xmath refer to the wavenumbers of the two observing
wavelengths ( Berger03 ) . In our model the refractive index of air was
calculated using a composite of Ciddor96 and Mathar07 models in order to
cover the full NIR. Atmospheric conditions, such as temperature and
humidity were taken to be average values for the CHARA laboratory.

Overall the LDCs are capable of correcting for atmospheric longitudinal
dispersion between the H and J bands, making simultaneous observations
possible.

#### 5.1.3 Software control

A variety of software developments were required in order to conduct
these observations. In addition to changes to the real-time operating
code of MIRC-X/CHARA, the reduction pipeline had to be modified, as
outlined below. Also, I independently verified the data products by
calibrating known calibrator stars and ensuring the stability of the
transfer function.

The control of the LDCs is based upon that developed by Berger03 for
controlling dispersion between the visible and NIR. This software was
adapted and expanded by adopting the dispersion models described in
section 5.1.2 . The basic function of the software is to receive the
delay line cart positions in order to calculate the total amount of
atmosphere in the system. Using equation 5.1 it calculates the thickness
of glass required to correct for this dispersion, which is then
translated into the linear movement for the LDC. This is done at a rate
of one LDC per second, meaning a full movement cycle of the LDCs is 6
seconds. Theoretically a fast update rate is possible given the
technological constraints of the network and translation stages.
However, @xmath rate is sufficient given the slow rate of change of the
total air path length in the system.

#### 5.1.4 Data Reduction and Calibration Pipeline

The data reduction pipeline for MIRC-X is already well established and
publicly available ( Anugu20 ) . It has a proven track record through
several publications. However, it was not designed to reduce J band data
and so several changes had to be made to the existing code.

The first change to the data reduction pipeline consisted of adjusting
the fringes and photometry windows to accurately detect and account for
the J band flux. Previously the flux window had been detected by fitting
a simple Gaussian to the detector flux, however, due to the presence of
the notch filter the dual-band data is double-peaked. Figure 5.3 shows
the detector window of MIRC-X covering both the H and J bands, the
spectral range of the J band is just over half that of the H band.

The second change comes from the spectral calibration, that is the
process of determining the wavelength of each spectral channel. The
wavelength is assigned by fitting the frequency of the fringe patterns,
based on an initial guess. The initial guess is based on the known
spectral dispersion of the prism used, in this case @xmath . Figure 5.3
shows the spectral calibration result obtained from the MIRC-X data
reduction pipeline for artificially produced interference fringes. Both
the initial guess and the final fitted spectral calibration are shown.

In order to ensure the validity of the data products, careful
calibration tests were undertaken. The calibration procedure was
unchanged from the standard MIRC-X pipeline as described in great detail
elsewhere ( Anugu20 ) . Figure 5.4 shows the transfer function on a
single baseline across the three hour observing period on the night of
2019 November 19. The 4 wavelength channels are those across the J band
only, as the calibration of the H band channels has already been
verified in previous papers. The linearity of the transfer function
shows the stability of the observing across the 2.5 hour period. Large
jumps in the transfer function on short timescales would indicate
instability/inaccuracies in the dispersion control subsystems.

#### 5.1.5 Impact and Next Steps

The impact of this work has been to demonstrate that dual H and J band
observations are possible with MIRC-X and can produce scientifically
valid, valuable results. I have shown that atmospheric chromatic
dispersion can be corrected for using longitudinal dispersion
compensators and the results can be reduced and calibrated effectively.
This work has paved the way for the H+J observing mode to be
commissioned for public use in the near future.

There are some additional steps in the commissioning of the J band
observing mode as one available to the community. Firstly, in early 2021
new LDCs were installed at CHARA in order to support the upcoming SPICA
instrument and its integration with MIRC-X as a fringe tracker. Though
the effect of these new LDCs has been modelled it has yet to be tested
in the J band mode, these observations are planned for summer 2021.
Additionally, there willl be an installation of new optical fibres into
the MIRC-X instrument. These fibres have been created so as to minimise
the differences in their lengths in order to minimise the effect of
internal instrumental birefringence. The new fibres will also come with
a new V-groove with optimised fibre spacing, allowing us to achieve
6-telescope J+H band observations for the first time. They have a factor
2 better length equalisation with a planned install at MIRC-X in summer
2022. The data reduction pipeline is believed to be ready for
deployment. However, further tests are required to validate the data
products following the deployment of new LDCs and instrumental fibres.

My contributions to this work involve the modelling of atmospheric
dispersion and measuring of internal birefringence. In addition, the LDC
correction models were developed by myself, the control of the LDCs and
MIRC-X integration was done in collaboration with Jean-Baptiste Le
Bouquin and Narsireddy Anugu. The observations were proposed and
conducted by myself with more planned this summer. Following the first
science observations, the data were reduced, calibrated and verified by
myself. Additional guidance and advice was provided in collaboration
with the MIRC-X consortium: John D. Monnier, Stefan Kraus, Jean-Baptiste
Le Bouquin, Narsireddy Anugu, Tyler Gardener, Cyprien Lanthermann,
Claire L. Davies, Benjamin Setterholm & Jacob Ennis.

### 5.2 Baseline Solution Modelling

The baseline solution of an interferometer is a model which predicts the
position of the delay line carts for a given pointing on sky. As
described in Chapter 4 in order to achieve coherence of the incoming
wavefronts across all telescopes in an array, the delay lines must be
positioned with micrometer level precision. A baseline solution requires
precision measurements of the entire optical system, including telescope
positions and differential light paths. The measurement of these
variables to the required accuracy is too difficult a task to undertake
directly, they can however be obtained indirectly. By recording the
actual delay line position when fringe tracking for multiple positions
on sky, a series of simultaneous equations can be built up. These
equations can then be solved for their unknown components, the exact
geometry of the system. There is never a universal solution for all
observations due to changing optics, temperatures, and turbulence. For
this reason the parameters are fit to minimise the residuals between the
predicted fringe position and actual fringe position.

The consequences of a poor baseline solution can have dire consequences
for observers. The solution determines the distance over which a user
must ’scan’, manually moving the delay lines to find fringes. A good
baseline solution means the prediction of the delay line positions is
good and fringes can be found more efficiently. It is also vitally
important for observations of faint and low visibility objects where
fringes may not be found in the first scan.

#### 5.2.1 The Difficulty of Baseline Solutions at CHARA

Given a simple interferometer with fixed beam paths, the construction of
a baseline solution is a mathematically relatively simple to
parameterise problem, requiring only the modelling of 4 parameters per
telescope. The X, Y and Z positions each telescope relative to a
reference telescope and the differential light paths between each scope
and the reference. The contribution of the telescope positions to the
optical path difference (OPD) is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Where @xmath is the optical path difference, @xmath are the coordinates
of telescope 1 and @xmath and @xmath are the elevation of and azimuth of
the observation respectively. This approach results in a low number of
degrees of freedom within the model, meaning few observations are
required to constrain the model to a good degree of precision.

However, the CHARA array represents a unique challenge in baseline
solution modelling. In addition to the fundamental parameters already
described, there are additional parameters to consider. Firstly, the
beam order of the CHARA array can and does change frequently. That is
different telescopes will pass light through different laboratory beams
on different nights, depending on the setup. Each beam within the lab
will have a different length air path. This introduces 6 additional
parameters to the model, one for each of the beam positions. Secondly,
CHARA employs Pipes of Pan (PoPs) in order to extend the range of delay
of the delay lines. These are fixed amounts of delay that can moved in
or out of the light path of each telescope. At CHARA there are 5
independent PoPs per telescope, this results in 30 additional parameters
in the modelling. Overall the number of degrees of freedom within a
CHARA baseline solution is much greater than that of simpler arrays. To
compute the baseline solution commercial software known as iphase ¹ ¹ 1
http://www.tpointsw.uk/ was used by CHARA, this software used every
individual pair of telescopes, beams and PoPs as a degree of freedom in
order to compute the x, y and z coordinates of each telescope and the
light path length of each scope. It did not have the ability to
calculate PoP or lab beam lengths or to model any changes over time. As
such the software was severely limiting.

Historically the baseline solution of CHARA has been poor for several
reasons. Firstly, it was created using observations from only 2 or 3
telescope combiners, providing 1 or 3 baselines per observation, and not
the 6 telescope combiner MIRC-X providing 15 baselines. As a result
there were significantly fewer linked observations available to
constrain the model, creating considerable discrepancies. Following from
this, a significant number of observation were required in order to
produce a complete model, often a year of more of observations were
combined. Over such long periods of time, there are inevitably changes
in the geometry of the array structure from both thermal expansion and
contraction on seasonal timescales and geographical changes in a
seismically active area. Figure 5.5 shows the problems with such a
dataset when attempting to compute a new solution, many of the fit
residuals are several mm in magnitude and vary widely based on position
on sky. This leads to large offsets in the expected cart position and
fast drifts in offsets over time. Clearly a better approach was
required.

#### 5.2.2 A New Generation Model for CHARA

The development of a new baseline solution for CHARA was a two-step
process. Firstly, the recording of an additional, improved dataset and
secondly, the creation of a new, more intuitive fitting tool. In terms
of data collection, the key to an improved solution is multiple
telescope data taken over a short time period. To this end MIRC-X data
is the ideal instrument. As such, software updates were implemented to
allow the efficient and convenient recording of MIRC-X delay line
offsets. In addition, to allow the quality control of data additional
information was recorded including the name of instrument, operational
wavelength and the date/time of observation. The lack of this data prior
to the project made analysis of any potential issues very difficult. In
addition, I proposed for, and obtained dedicated observing time over 2
nights in November 2018. During this time I conducted extensive
observations with MIRC-X with the aim of completing a good sky coverage
with as many telescope, beam and PoP configurations as possible. In this
way long term changes in array geometry and laboratory setups were
minimised to allow for a consistent dataset to be recorded.

The origin of the data used to compute the baseline solution was not the
only problem, indeed the computation was problematic as explained in the
previous section. In order to overcome the shortfalls of iphase , a new
software was developed called the BaselinE SOlution Tool (BESOT).
Written in Python as a separate, alternative code to iphase by myself
and Jean-Baptiste Le Bouquin. This tool allows for intuitive degrees of
freedom that reflect specific array parameters rather than a degree of
freedom for each individual configuration. For example PoP 1 of
telescope S2 is a degree of freedom that is assigned to all observations
containing that specific PoP. In this way there are only 66 degrees if
freedom to solve for rather than the hundreds to thousands using the
’iphase method’. This allows for all parameters to be fitted
simultaneously and a vastly improved solution to be obtained.

The newly developed BESOT also allowed for an in depth look at the stars
with make up the observations to allow me to explore potential
correlations between stellar parameters and fitting residuals. Of
particular interest were stars of high or poorly constrained proper
motions. The computations within the CHARA pointing model are based on
Hipparcos measured positions and proper motions, as opposed to the more
recent and far more accurate GAIA values. If the proper motion of a star
was poorly constrained by Hipparcos the recorded stellar position in the
baseline solution may be wrong compared to the actual position on sky.
In addition to proper motions, I also checked for correlations with
stellar classification and parallax and found no significant
correlations.

#### 5.2.3 Tracking Long Term Drifts

It was discovered early in the process that using offset data taken over
a long period of time resulted in a poor fit to the solution parameters.
This raised the idea of long term temporal changes in the array
geometry, the question remained whether these changes were random or
structured trends. The extent of these trends over the past 3 years is
shown in Figure 5.7 . These offsets are computed from observations
corrected to assume the same baseline solution was in place across the
whole 3 years. In this way the only cause of changes to the level of the
offsets are physical changes at the array.

The scale of changes over several months is of the order of @xmath and
appears to weakly correlate to the seasonal temperature changes. As
temperatures decrease over the latter half of the year the offsets move
in a negative direction, this cycle roughly repeats annually but is
difficult to model given the limited data available. Lower nightly
temperatures appear to signify an over-estimation of the delay line
position, meaning negative delay line offsets must be applied by the
observer. Inversely, higher temperatures signify an under-estimation of
the delay line positions. The correlation with temperature indicates
that thermal contraction/expansion is the cause. However, narrowing down
the part(s) of the array which are expanding and contracting on long
time scales is a near impossible task and beyond the scope of this work.
Knowing the timescales and magnitudes associated with these trends is
enough to plan effective countermeasures.

#### 5.2.4 Impact of Development at CHARA

The impact of my intervention will be lasting at CHARA as the benefits
of an improved baseline solution have now been proven. Prior to this
work searching for fringes manually by applying offsets to the delay
lines was a labourious task with offsets frequently reported up to
@xmath from their predicted position. Since the developments described
in this chapter these offsets have been significantly reduced to @xmath
immediately following the deployment of a new solution, with low
degradation over time as described in Section 5.2.3 . This substantial
improvement allows for highly efficient observing in addition to making
it possible to observe faint and low visibility objects easier.

The recognition of long term drifts within the solution on the scale of
weeks-months was fully recognised during this undertaking. It is now
routine operation that a new, complete, solution is computed at least
twice a year and that smaller adjustments are made during the interim
periods as the needs of observers dictates. This ensures the continuity
of a good baseline solution and is a vast improvement over previous
efforts in which a single solution was computed each year.

This work was undertaken in collaboration with Jean-Baptiste Le Bouquin
who co-developed the new baseline solution tool BESOT ² ² 2
https://gitlab.com/alabdon/baseline-solution-multi-tool and assisted
with interpretation. Also involved in the undertaking was Theo ten
Brummelaar, who as director of CHARA was able to provide assistance in
recording MIRC-X offsets and in the operation of iphase . In addition,
he developed additional iphase modules to validify the results obtained
from BESOT. I served as project coordinator leading the push for a
better baseline solution, co-authoring and later solo-developing the
BESOT program. In addition, I was responsible for the analysis of
archived data to identify problem data sets and the analysis and
tracking of long term drifts in the solution.

## Chapter 6 Dusty disk winds at the sublimation rim of the highly
inclined, low mass young stellar object SU Aurigae ^(†) ^(†) Large parts
of this chapter are published in Labdon19

T Tauri stars are low-mass young stars whose disks provide the setting
for planet formation. Despite this, their structure is poorly
understood. I present infrared interferometric observations of the SU
Aurigae circumstellar environment that offer resolution that is three
times higher and a better baseline position angle coverage than previous
observations. In this section I aimed to investigate the characteristics
of the circumstellar material around SU Aur and constrain the disk
geometry. To this end, the CHARA array offers unique opportunities for
long baseline observations, with baselines up to @xmath m. Using the
CLIMB three-telescope combiner in the K-band allows us to measure
visibilities as well as closure phase. I undertook image reconstruction
for model-independent analysis, and fitted geometric models such as
Gaussian and ring distributions. Additionally, the fitting of radiative
transfer models constrain the physical parameters of the disk. For the
first time, a dusty disk wind was introduced to the radiative transfer
code TORUS to model protoplanetary disks. This implementation was
motivated by theoretical models of dusty disk winds, where magnetic
field lines drive dust above the disk plane close to the sublimation
zone. Image reconstruction reveals an inclined disk with slight
asymmetry along its minor-axis, likely due to inclination effects
obscuring the inner disk rim through absorption of incident star light
on the near-side and thermal re-emission and scattering of the far-side.
Geometric modelling of a skewed ring finds the inner rim at @xmath with
an inclination of @xmath and minor axis position angle @xmath .
Radiative transfer modelling shows a flared disk with an inner radius at
@xmath au which implies a grain size of @xmath m assuming astronomical
silicates and a scale height of @xmath au at @xmath au. Among the tested
radiative transfer models, only the dusty disk wind successfully
accounts for the K-band excess by introducing dust above the mid-plane.
It is shown that a dusty disk wind model is a viable scenario to explain
these interferometric observations and the spectral energy distribution
of SU Aurigae, with enough hot dust to reproduce the observed NIR
excess.

### 6.1 Introduction

SU Aurigae (SU Aur) is a @xmath old (from isochrone fitting, Bochanski18
) low mass pre-main-sequence star in the Upper Sco star forming region
at a distance of @xmath , obtained from GAIA DR2 parallax measurements (
GAIA2par ) . As a G2-type star it has a similar effective temperature to
the sun ( DeWarf ) , but a much higher bolometric luminosity at @xmath
(calculated from GAIA DR2, GAIA2phot ) putting it in the sub-giant star
class. The stellar parameters adopted are listed in Table 6.1 . SU Aur
is known to be variable in the V band, varying up to @xmath mag over a
several day cycle ( Unruh04 ) . On the other hand variability in the
K band is minimal ( Akeson05 ) allowing us to assume the flux
contribution from the star is constant across different epochs of
observations. As such, any variation in the visibility is likely
geometric.

Spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of SU Aur by Petrov19 has
revealed that a dusty disk wind is the potential source of the
photometric variability in both SU Aur and RY Tau, caused by changes in
circumstellar extinction as opposed to chromospheric variability. The
characteristic time of change in the disk wind outflow velocity and the
stellar brightness indicate that the obscuring dust is located close to
the sublimation rim of the disk, in agreement with previous theoretical
disk wind models ( Bans12 ; Konigl11 ) .

Interferometric observations in the K band carried out by Akeson05 using
the Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI), a three-telescope
interferometer with baselines up to @xmath m, found a disk inclined at
@xmath with a minor axis position angle of @xmath and a sublimation rim
at @xmath au. The disk was modelled as a flared disk with a vertical
inner wall of emission using radiative transfer to fit both
interferometric and photometric data. However, optically thick gas close
to the central star was needed to fit the SED. The disk geometry is in
agreement with values from Eisner14 using the Keck interferometer with
values derived from an upper limit to the fit of the Br @xmath emission.
They find an upper limit on the disk inclination of @xmath and minor
axis position angle of @xmath . The difference in the derived position
angles in previous studies is likely due to the lack of Br @xmath
emission and poor signal to noise of Eisner14 and the limited baseline
range of Akeson05 . Hence, new observations with significantly better uv
coverage on much longer baselines were needed. Additionally,
polarimetric imaging campaigns, undertaken by deLeon15 and Jeffers14
revealed the presence of tails protruding from the disk at both H-band
and visible wavelengths, likely associated with an extended reflection
nebula and a possible undetected brown dwarf companion encounter. A
companion search was undertaken by the SEEDS (Strategic Exploration of
Exoplanets and Disks with Subaru) imaging survey and ruled out the
presence of a companion down to @xmath Jupiter masses at separations
down to @xmath , contradicting the potential brown dwarf encounter
theory of deLeon15 .

In this chapter I present the lowest mass YSO to be studied with very
long baseline ( @xmath m) NIR interferometry to date and the first study
to probe the detailed rim structure of SU Aur with interferometric
observation on baselines up to @xmath m. Three different modelling
methodologies were applied: (i) Image reconstruction was used to obtain
a model-independent representation of the data and to derive the basic
object morphology. (ii) Following this geometric model fitting allowed
me to gain an appreciation for the viewing geometry of the disk by
fitting Gaussian and ring models to the data. (iii) Finally, I combined
interferometry and photometry to derive physical parameters with
radiative transfer analysis, where the particular focus was on the
physical characteristics of the inner rim.

The observations are described in section 6.2 , with image
reconstruction detailed in section 6.3 . The geometrical model fitting
approach is described in section 6.4 and radiative transfer modelling
and SED fitting are discussed in section 6.5 . A discussion and analysis
of the results can be found in section 6.6 , followed by concluding
remarks made in section 6.7 .

### 6.2 Observations

The CHARA array is a Y-shaped interferometric facility that comprises
six @xmath m telescopes. It is located at the Mount Wilson Observatory,
California, and offers operational baselines between @xmath and @xmath m
( Brummelaar05 ) . The CLIMB instrument, a three-telescope beam combiner
( Brummelaar13 ) , was used to obtain observations in the near-infrared
K-band ( @xmath ) between October 2010 and November 2014. I obtained 28
independent measurements of SU Aur, using seven different two-telescope
configurations with maximum physical baseline of @xmath m corresponding
to a resolution of @xmath [milliarcseconds], where @xmath is the
observing wavelength and @xmath is the projected baseline. In addition,
a small number of observations were taken in 2009 using the
two-telescope CLASSIC beam combiner ( Brummelaar13 ) , also at CHARA in
the K-band along the longest ( @xmath m) projected baseline. Details of
the observations, and the calibrator(s) observed for the target during
each observing session, are summarised in Table 6.2 . The uv plane
coverage that I achieved for the target is displayed in Figure 6.1 . The
data covers a relatively wide range of baseline lengths and position
angles, making the data set suitable for image reconstruction.

The CLIMB and CLASSIC data were reduced using pipelines developed at the
University of Michigan ( Davies18 ) . This is much better suited to
recovering faint fringes from low visibility data than the standard
CHARA reduction pipeline of ( Brummelaar12 ) . The measured visibilities
and closure phases were calibrated using interferometric calibrator
stars observed alongside the target. Their adopted uniform diameters
(UDs) were obtained from JMMC SearchCal ( Bonneau06 ; Bonneau11 ) , when
available, or gcWeb ¹ ¹ 1
http://nexsciweb.ipac.caltech.edu/gcWeb/gcWeb.jsp and are listed in
Table 6.2 .

During the data reduction it was found that the calibrators HD 31592 and
HD 34052 exhibited strong closure phase signals, indicating the presence
of close companions around these stars. In order to ensure these binary
calibrators could be used to calibrate the primary science target, I
cross-calibrated the data on these stars with other calibrators observed
during the same nights to determine the binary parameters, as outlined
in Section A . Based on the fitted binary parameters, I could then
correct the transfer function and use the data for the calibration of
SU Aur.

In addition to the new observations from CHARA, archival interferometric
data from other facilities was included for the analysis. A small amount
of data was available from the Keck Interferometer (KI, Colavita13 ;
Eisner14 ) from 2011 along a single @xmath m baseline, while a larger
amount of data was also available from the Palomar Testbed
Interferometer (PTI, Colavita99 ) from 1999 to 2004 using a
two-telescope beam combiner on 3 different physical baselines between
@xmath and @xmath m. This data was published in Akeson05 . These
additional measurements complement the CHARA observations in the
intermediate baseline range; the full uv coverage is shown in Figure 6.1
.

Both the PTI and KI data were calibrated using the standard method
outlined by Boden98 using the wbCalib software available from NExcScI ²
² 2 http:// http://nexsci.caltech.edu/software/V2calib/wbCalib/ . The
calibration pipeline works in conjunction with getCal and the Hipparcos
catalogue ( Perryman97 ) for calibrator star astrometry and diameters.
This was the same process used by Akeson05 to extract visibilities from
the PTI data. The re-reduction of this data agrees with the results
shown in the literature. The fully reduced data from all instruments is
shown in Figure 6.2 .

As I combine several years worth of data, care was taken to check for
time dependencies in the visibilities of baselines of similar length and
position angle. Variability in the K band is known to be minimal, so any
time dependencies in the visibility amplitudes is likely geometric.
However, no significant time dependencies were discovered.

### 6.3 Image reconstruction

Image reconstruction techniques require broad and circular uv coverage
along as many baseline lengths as possible. Fortunately, the data from
the observations lends itself to this process as the uv plane has been
well sampled, though some small gaps remain in the position angle
coverage. By comparing visibilities from different instrument at similar
baseline lengths and position angles, one can see there is likely very
little extended emission in this system and so no correction for
instrument field of view is required. This technique is useful for
interpretation of non-zero closure phases, indicative of asymmetric
distributions, in a model-independent way. The closure phase values are
shown in Figure 6.2 . There are many different algorithms with which to
reconstruct images from interferometric data, but the process described
here involved the use of the Polychromatic Image Reconstruction Pipeline
(PIRP) which encompasses the @xmath reconstruction algorithm by MiRA08 .
The reconstruction procedure and results are described below.

In the @xmath routine, the object is modelled as an unresolved central
star with an extended, model-independent, environment ( Kluska14 ) .
Both components have different spectral behaviours and so differing
spectral indices. Additionally, the type and weight of the
regularisation was explored, @xmath allows for either quadratic
smoothing or total variation regularisations to be implemented. The
regularisation plays the role of the missing information by promoting a
certain type of morphology in the image. The quadratic smoothing
algorithm aims for the smallest possible changes between pixels to
produce a smoother image, it is particularly useful as the quadratic
nature means it is less likely to find local minima. On the other hand,
total variation aims to minimise the total flux gradient of the image
and is useful to describe uniform areas with steep but localised
changes. These regularisations are considered to be the best ones for
optical interferometric image reconstruction; ( Renard11 ) . The size
and number of pixels also plays an important role in image
reconstruction. One cannot simply use the maximum number of pixels of
the smallest size to obtain better resolution, they have to be chosen to
match uv plane sampling. It was found that a quadratic smoothing
regularisation with a weight of @xmath and @xmath pixels of @xmath mas
in size provides the best-fit image reconstruction when utilising exact
Fourier transform methods. The optimal regularisation parameters were
determined using the L-curve method. PIRP also allows for bootstrap
iterations ( Efron94 ) starting from a previous best image. This
involves a random draw of data points within the dataset to determine
the reliable features of the image. The process was carried out 500
times allowing for a pixel by pixel error estimation, see Kluska16 .

The final image is shown in Figure 6.3 (upper left panel), which also
shows the asymmetry in the intensity map (upper right panel). The
contours represent the @xmath (dashed line), @xmath and @xmath (solid
lines) uncertainties. The asymmetry is calculated by rotating the image
through @xmath and subtracting it from the un-rotated image. It is this
residual flux that produces the non-zero closure phases, highlighting
any areas of greater emission within the disk. Using this technique one
can see that the disk has greater intensity in the eastern regions,
which contains @xmath more flux that the western regions with a flux
ratio of @xmath , where the remaining flux is in the central star. By
inclining a flared disk with the western region (bottom right of image)
towards the observer the nearside of the inner rim becomes self-shadowed
by the near-side disk rim, so the eastern region inclined away from the
observer appears brighter. The image shows a disk radius of @xmath mas,
a minor-axis position angle of @xmath and an inclination of @xmath . The
fit of the image to the visibility and closure phases in the data is
shown in Figure 6.3 , with a combined visibility and closure phase
reduced @xmath of @xmath .

### 6.4 Geometric Model Fitting

The next step in interpreting the interferometric observations is the
fitting of simple geometric models to the observed quantities. The
visibility profile (Figure 6.2 ) reveals a clear drop in visibility
through short and intermediate baselines with a possible plateau/second
lobe at the longest baselines. In the visibility profile I do not see
any evidence for structures on distinct different spatial scales that
might indicate the presence of a binary companion or extended halo
emission. The closure phases are all @xmath , indicating weak asymmetric
features as evidenced in the image reconstruction above. To explore the
viewing geometry of the disk, a series of simple intensity distributions
were tested against the data. All the models tested contained an
unresolved point source that was used to represent the central star, a
reasonable assumption given the expected angular diameter of the star
(see Table. 6.1 ). The disk component was modelled as one of three
intensity distributions: (i) A Gaussian to simulate a disk with
unresolved inner rim with a FWHM free parameter. (ii) A ring to simulate
emission from a bright inner rim only with a defined fractional width
equal to @xmath of the radius with an inner radius ( @xmath ) free
parameter. (iii) A skewed ring model with a diffuse radial profile
defined by an inner radius ( @xmath ), a FWHM ( @xmath ) and an
azimuthal brightness modulation, where @xmath and @xmath are the cosine
and sine amplitudes for mode @xmath , in an attempt to model disk
asymmetries. Lazareff17 find that the diffuse skewed ring here can be
used to successfully model a wide range of YSOs.

With the exception of the skewed ring, these models are intrinsically
axisymmetric, but I project the brightness distribution in order to
mimic viewing geometry effects that are parameterised with an
inclination angle @xmath (defined with @xmath as face-on) and a disk
position angle @xmath . I measured disk position angles along the minor
axis and follow the convention that position angles are measured from
north ( @xmath ) towards east.

The stellar-to-non-stellar flux ratio can be calculated by comparing
K-band photometry ( Curi03 ) with the stellar atmosphere models of
Kurucz04 , which gives a ratio of @xmath (using the stellar parameters
listed in Table 6.1 ). However, it cannot be fixed as this has been
shown to introduce unreasonable large scale components when fitting long
baseline data ( Ajay13 ) . As such the parameter space of the flux ratio
was explored step-wise for all models with a range of model parameters.
In this way the stellar-to-total flux ratio was constrained for all
models. It was found that a ratio of @xmath provided the best fit to the
data for the ring, skewed ring and TGM models. After determining the
star-to-disk flux ratio, the parameter space of the geometric models
could be fitted to the observed visibilities and closure phases for each
of the observed baselines given initial parameter constraints based on
the literature values of Akeson05 described in Section 8.1 . I used a
bootstrap method to explore the parameter space around these initial
values and to compute uncertainties on the individual parameters by
fitting Gaussian distributions to parameter histograms.

The best-fit parameters and associated errors for each of the geometric
models are shown in Table 6.3 . All test models agree with respect to
the position angle and inclination of the disk very well (Table 6.3 ).
However, none of the models provide good fits to the data as evidence by
the @xmath values of between 11.86 (ring model) and @xmath (skewed
ring). The skewed ring model found a minor axis position angle of @xmath
and inclination of @xmath . Of the individual models, the skewed ring
provides the best fit to both the visibilities and closure phases. Both
the Gaussian model and the Skewed Ring are found to be quite diffuse
with a FWHM of @xmath and width of @xmath respectively.

Overall, I achieved the best-fit with a skewed ring with an inner radius
of @xmath and a ring FWHM of @xmath , thus making the ring very diffuse
with only a marginally defined inner radius. There was no evidence
discovered for any over-resolved extended emission or ’halo’ found in
many other objects ( Monnier06a ; Kraus2009 ) .

In order to model the observed CP signal, with a maximum of @xmath ,
which may indicate a slight asymmetry in the disk, I introduced
asymmetries to the skewed ring model ( Lazareff17 ) . However, this
improved the fit only marginally over the standard ring model from Table
6.3 . It was found that zero closure phases produced a reduced
chi-squared ( @xmath ) fit of @xmath , while a sinusoidally modulated
asymmetric ring only resulted in a @xmath of @xmath . The model
visibility curves corresponding to the best-fit skewed ring model are
shown in Figure 6.4 , 6.5 and 6.6 (red curve). The different panels show
visibilities towards different position angle bins.

Of the simple geometric models tested, the skewed ring model provides
the best fit. However, none can be said to provide a good fit to the
observed data, as evidence by the @xmath values shown in Table 6.3 . As
such, more complex disk structures are required, such as flared disks,
different rim morphologies or disk winds. In the next section, these
possibilities are explored in detail using radiative transfer
techniques. This allows us to not only explore complex geometries, but
to derive physical parameters such as radial density profiles and the
disk scale heights.

### 6.5 Radiative Transfer Modelling

I used the TORUS Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code ( Harries00 ) ,
allowing for the simultaneous fitting of visibility, closure phase and
photometric data to further constrain the geometry and physical dust
properties of the SU Aurigae circumstellar disk.

Starting from the disk properties derived by Akeson05 , I explored
radiative transfer models with different scale heights (where scale
height is that of the gas parameterised at @xmath with flaring index
@xmath ) and inner rim shapes. The flaring index @xmath describes the
radial gradient of the disk scael height, such that @xmath ( Kenyon87 )
and is a free parameter. In the TORUS simulations, the dust was allowed
to vertically settle where large grains @xmath were settled to @xmath of
the disk scale height @xmath while small grains @xmath were allowed to
inhabit the full disk scale height. The grain size adopted depends on
the model adopted as described below. The dust sublimation radius was
left as a free parameter, allowing the inner rim radius to define itself
based on well-defined rules of the Lucy99 iterative method to determine
the location and the temperature structure of the whole disk. This is
implemented whereby the temperature is initially calculated for grid
cells in an optically thin disk structure, with dust added iteratively
to each cell with a temperature lower than that of sublimation, until
the appropriate dust to gas ratio is reached ( @xmath ). Once TORUS has
converged to radiative equilibrium a separate Monte Carlo algorithm is
used to compute images and SEDs based on the optical properties of the
dust species implemented. I confirmed that stellar photosphere models of
Kurucz04 using these stellar parameters can reproduce the photometry
measurements of SU Aur reasonably well across the visible continuum. The
grain size distribution used by Akeson05 is a distribution of
astronomical silicate grains up to @xmath in size throughout the disk. I
adopt a silicate grain species with dust properties and opacities
adopted from Draine84 . The initial density structure of the gas is
based upon the @xmath -disk prescription of Shakura73 where the disk
density is given as:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here, @xmath is the vertical distance from the midplane while the
parameters @xmath and @xmath describe the scale height and the surface
density respectively. In the radiative transfer models, I represent the
stellar photosphere with a Kurucz79 model atmosphere using the stellar
parameters outlined in Table 6.1 . The photometric data was obtained
from a wide range of instruments from the VizieR database and are
compiled in Table B.1 . Where multiple observations in the same waveband
were present care was taken to minimise the total number of instruments
and keep the number of observation epochs as close as possible to
minimise any potential variability effects.

Visibilities were calculated from synthetic images of the disk system
(as shown in Figure 6.7 ) extracted through application of the van
Cittert-Zernicke theorem, applied using a 1D Fourier transforms
projected onto the observed baseline position angle. Phases are also
extracted from the images and are used to calculate the closure phase,
as described in Davies18 .

The parameter space of the radiative transfer models was explored
objectively using the values of Akeson05 as a starting point. A range of
physically realistic values for each parameter was explored in a broad
grid of models (as described in Table 6.4 ). A @xmath value was then
computed for the visibilities, closure phases and SED fits of each model
allowing the grid to be refined around the minimum. The interferometric
and photometric data points were fitted simultaneously, with the
resulting @xmath values shown in Table LABEL:table:Chi2 . The silicate
feature at @xmath allows us to place some constraints on the dust sizes,
as larger grains produce smaller features. The growth of dust grains and
their effects on observed silicate features is described in a review by
Natta07 . The IR flux is controlled by the morphology of the sublimation
rim. As the inner radius increases, the amount of circumstellar material
emitting in mid-IR wavelengths is reduced, and the IR emission
decreases. The shape of the mid-IR excess also describes the degree of
flaring present in the disk, where large excess indicates greater
flaring. A larger flaring power in a disk leads to an increasing surface
intercepting the starlight, and therefore an increase in reprocessed
radiation. I adjusted the total dust mass in the model in order to match
the millimeter flux. A detailed description of the effect of disk
parameters on the SEDs of protoplanetary disks can be found in
Robitaille07 .

Due to the optical depth of the system the inner-rim of the disk appears
as the brightest part of the disk at NIR wavelengths. This is because
the rest of the disk is shadowed by the inner rim and only rises out of
shadow in cooler regions of longer wavelength emission.

#### 6.5.1 Sublimation Rim Model

The curved rim of Isella05 , henceforth IN05, is based upon a single
grain size prescription with a gas density-dependent sublimation
temperature. Due to a vertical gas pressure gradient, the sublimation
temperature decreases away from the mid-plane, creating a curved rim.
The sublimation temperature of the grains follows

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the constant @xmath K, @xmath , @xmath is the radial distance into
the disk and @xmath is the height above the midplane ( Pollack94 ) .

A curved rim is shown to be a viable disk model by Flock16a and Flock16b
, based upon extensive hydrodynamical simulations. A wide range of disk
structure parameters are explored to find the best fit solution to both
the interferometric measurements and the SED. Figure 6.4 shows the
results of radiative transfer modelling of the IN05 rim prescription.
The model SED shows a clear flux deficit in the NIR, with a K-band flux
of just 64% of the 2MASS photometric point, far outside the limited
range of variability of SU Aur. This is also clear in the visibility
curves, shown in green, where the overall shape is a good fit, but the
minimum visibility is too high due to a larger than expected stellar
contribution.

An alternative sublimation front geometry is proposed by Tannirkulam07 ,
henceforth THM07. This model employs a two-grain scenario, were a
mixture of small @xmath grains and large @xmath grains has been adopted,
with the mass of larger grains fixed at @xmath times the mass of smaller
grains. The smaller grains are not allowed to settle, so the scale
height is fixed to that of the gas. The larger grains are allowed to
settle to 60% of the scale height of the gas. This combined with the
larger grains existing closer to the star, due to more efficient
cooling, leads to an elongated and curved sublimation front. Figure 6.5
shows the results of this modelling. The SED again shows a clear deficit
in NIR flux, with a K-band flux of just 68%, comparable with that of the
IN05 prescription. The presence of dust closer to star changes the shape
of the visibility curve dramatically, with the first lobe now extending
to much longer baselines. The two grain THM07 model proves to be a worse
fit than the single grain IN05 model.

The results show that the best fit of the curved-rim disk model of IN05
can be achieved with a single silicate grain species with a single grain
size of @xmath . The addition of larger grain species further reduced
near-infrared flux in 1-3 @xmath region, resulting in a poorer fit to
the SED in both the shape and magnitude of the NIR excess. The disk is
also found to be highly flared and extending from @xmath to @xmath au,
loosely constrained by the long wavelength photometry, while still
solving for vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. Importantly, comparison of
the stellar atmosphere, represented by the Kurucz model atmosphere (
Kurucz04 ) , with the photometric data can provide the stellar-to-total
flux ratio for each waveband. In the K-band this ratio is found to be
@xmath , meaning the circumstellar environment contributes @xmath of the
total flux. The dust to gas ratio is fixed to @xmath , as taken from
literature values ( Akeson05 ) . The NIR flux deficit results also in a
poor fit to the K-band visibilities.

#### 6.5.2 Dusty Disk Wind Model

In an attempt to increase the NIR flux contributions in the model, I
explored a dusty disk wind scenario as set out by Bans12 , henceforth
BK12. This model is described in detail in Section 2.5.2. The
prescription used in TORUS is taken from Bans12 , and assumes a steady,
axisymmetric, effectively cold disk outflow. The wind is launched from
the disk surface and is assumed to contained the same dust composition.
For the dust distribution, a constant dust-to-gas ratio is assumed to
match that of the disk, while this may not a be physical assumption it
does allow for estimates of dust quantities in the wind. The wind is
populated with dust in the same way as the disk and also converges
towards radiative equilibrium with each Lucy99 iteration. Full details
of the disk wind model implemented can be found in Bans12 and Konigl11 .
A wide parameter search was undertaken, in order to determine the
optimum solution (see Table 6.4 ). The stellar parameters were fixed to
those shown in Table 6.1 and the same silicate prescription was adopted
for all models, as in the IN05 and THM07 prescriptions The position
angle of the disk was fixed to that of the best fit geometric model
listed in Table 6.3 .

The results of the radiative transfer modelling of the BK12 wind are
shown in Figure 6.6 . The cross section shows the very inner-rim of
disk, uplifted dust above and below the mid-plane can clearly be seen.
The inner-rim is also curved using the IN05 prescription, although a
grain size of @xmath is required to produce the observed excess across
the infrared. The graon size was fitted in an integrated way, while
producing a grid of mdoels to fit all parameters. A range of grain sizes
were tested from @xmath to @xmath but @xmath grains provided the best
fit to the K-band photometric flux values.

An into-wind mass outflow rate of @xmath was required to uplift enough
material to reproduce the observed excess. Lower into-wind outflow rates
or a lower dust-to-gas ratio do not allow enough material to exist
exterior to the inner-rim to reproduce the observed K-band excess in the
photometry and interferometric data. If one assumes an outflow to
accretion ratio of @xmath one can predict an accretion rate of @xmath .
This is unphysically high for an object such as SU Aur given the
expected age of the system ( @xmath ), assuming that the rate stayed
constant over full period. In addition, this is in disagreement with
non-detection of @xmath emission by Eisner14 which is suggestive of a
lower outflow/accretion rate, however, no upper limit is derived. Other
free parameters in this parameterisation of a dusty disk wind cannot
reproduce the effect of a high into-wind mass accretion rate.

The dust wind scenario has the effect of increasing the amount of the
dust close to the star, where temperatures are sufficient for NIR flux
contribution. As shown in Figure 6.6 this model is in agreement with the
observed NIR photometry, with a K-band flux of 102% of the photometric
value, well within the range of variability of SU Aur. The rest of the
SED is still well fitted, as the curvature and shape are based upon the
IN05 prescription described above. Another feature of Figure 6.6 is the
’stair-stepping’ structure to the disk wind. This is caused by the
adaptive mesh refinement of TORUS, whereby mesh resolution is increased
in areas of large density changes. The structure of this
’stair-stepping’ was found to have a negligable impact on the results,
as the areas of the disk wind that are important to the IR visibilities
and SED are close to the disk rim where the disk mesh is sufficiently
refined. The visibility curves shown provide a good fit to the data
points, matching the lowest visibilities well. However, one cannot
negate the potentially unphysically high outflow/accretion rates
required to successfully model the data. The introduction of disk wind
also had the interesting effect of flattening the ’bump’ in the second
visibility lobe present in many disk models, including the IN05
prescription. The @xmath fits for the visibilities and SED for all three
models are shown in Table LABEL:table:Chi2 .

### 6.6 Discussion

In investigating the circumstellar environment of SU Aur I have explored
the structure and composition of the disk and greatly improved the
constraints on the parameters initially taken from literature. The wide
variety of techniques used to analyse the interferometric data allow us
to precisely define the disk characteristics.

Image reconstruction shows a disk inclined at @xmath , this is in
agreement with values of @xmath , ~ @xmath and ~ @xmath found by
Akeson05 ; Unruh04 ; Jeffers14 respectively. The minor axis @xmath on
the other hand was found to be @xmath , greater than the literature
values of @xmath , @xmath and @xmath found by Akeson05 ; Jeffers14 ;
deLeon15 respectively. This difference is likely due to either: The poor
uv coverage and lack of longer baselines in previous interferometric
studies, both of which make estimating the position angle and
inclination particularly unreliable. The image reconstruction also
reveals evidence of slight asymmetries within the disk at @xmath sigma
significance level, that are consistent with an inner disk rim seen at
an intermediate inclination. As the K-band emission primarily traces the
very inner region of the rim; if a disk is inclined the near side of the
rim will be partially obscured from view, while the far side of the rim
will be exposed to observation. This explanation can successfully
account for the over-brightness observed in the eastern disk region in
the image reconstruction shown in Fig. 6.3 and can also be seen in the
radiative transfer image shown in Fig. 6.3 . Models of the effect of
inclined disk on the observed brightness distribution are described by
Jang13 . There are several other scenarios that have been used to
explain asymmetries in protoplanetary disks in the past. Two possible
scenarios are: Firstly, a shell ejection episode that can carry dust and
gas away from the central star can be capable of reproducing the
photometric variability in different epochs of observations (
Fernandes09 ; Kluska18 ) . Also, the presence of a companion embedded
within the disk can create dust trapping vortices that capture dust
grains substantially altering the aximuthal structure of the disk. Such
assymetries, if present in the inner disk woudl substantially alter the
visibilities along those position angles. These vortices, however, are
known to trap primarily large grains (mm-size), not the small
micron-sized grain I observe in the infrared, as shown by Kraus17 ;
vdMarel13 . I rule out the presence of a companion by undertaking a
companion search using the geometric models; a second point source was
iterated through the parameter space with a grid size of @xmath mas in
steps of @xmath mas (see Sec. 7.3 ). However, the model fit did not
improve significantly by adding an off-centre point source. I therefore
favour the explanation of asymmetry arising from an inclined disk.

The geometric model fits were key in understanding the circumstellar
environment of SU Aur. It was found that a skewed ring structure is able
to fit the data best, which suggests that I trace a diffuse inner disk
edge. This finding is consistent with the studies on other YSOs that
found bright inner rims, such as the Lazareff17 survey of 51 Herbig AeBe
stars using the PIONIER instrument at the VLTI. They found that over
half of the disks could be successfully modelled using a diffuse ring
structure. A high optical depth of the circumstellar material causes a
bright inner rim, where most of the radiation is absorbed, scattered or
re-emitted. The best-fit Skewed ring model suggests that the
stellar-to-total flux ratio is @xmath and achieves a @xmath of @xmath .
Akeson05 find that @xmath of the total flux is in the SED K-band excess,
with a @xmath of flux in an extended envelope, this is in good agreement
with the values found from geometric modelling. The skewed ring model
fits a ring of radius @xmath au at an inclination of @xmath . These
values are in remarkable agreement with both the values derived from
image reconstruction in this study and the literature values of Akeson05
of @xmath au and @xmath , where the slight differences are likely due to
difference between the diffuse profile, skewed ring and the standard
ring structures employed. The minor axis @xmath of @xmath is similar to
the image reconstruction value, which is significantly larger than
literature values. As above, this is most likely due to the poor uv
coverage and short baselines available in previous interferometric
studies, making the estimates of position angle and inclination
particularly unreliable. The skewed ring also introduces modulated
asymmetries into the ring profile. The skewed ring geometric model with
azimuthal brightness modulation results in an improved fit with @xmath ,
where the contrast of the asymmetry is consistent with the one found
using image reconstruction techniques. Similarly this can be attributed
to inclination effects of the viewing geometry ( Jang13 ) . However, the
position angle of the asymmetry is not well constrained in these models.

Radiative transfer modelling of the disk allowed us to fit a physical
disk model to the visibility and photometry data simultaneously, meaning
the 3-D density distribution of the disk can be explored. In this paper,
three different geometries are considered: The single grain curved rim
of IN05, the two grain curved rim of THM07 and the addition of a dusty
disk wind of BK12 to the single grain curved rim. In the case of the
IN05 prescription, I follow the idea that the sublimation temperature is
gas-pressure dependent allowing the rim shape to be defined as described
in Sec. 6.5.1 . This model provides good constraints on the
characteristic size of the near-infrared emitting region and the flaring
in the colder regions, with a sublimation temperature of @xmath K
corresponding to an inner radius of @xmath au, slightly smaller than the
literature values of @xmath au ( Akeson05 ) and @xmath au ( Jeffers14 )
. The disk was also found to be at an inclination of ~ @xmath and
position angle of ~ @xmath , in agreement with both the literature and
above mentioned methods. This is shown to fit the photometry well at
both shorter and longer wavelengths. However, there is a clear deficit
in the IR excess, which also leads to poorly fitted visibilities due to
an over-estimation of the stellar-to-total flux ratio. The same issue is
obvious in the THM07 prescription, where larger grains are introduced
allowing dust to exist closer to the star, though this model also fails
to reproduce the visibility curve of the geometric modelling, as the
inner radius of the disk is much smaller. A two grain model does not
provide a good fit to these observations.

The dusty disk wind prescription of BK12 was incorporated into the
single grain disk model of IN05. Dust flung out from the inner regions
of the disk is carried far above and below the mid-plane. This dust is
directly exposed to stellar radiation so is hot enough to contribute to
NIR flux, whilst also obscuring the direct stellar flux. This was shown
to be a physically viable scenario for YSOs, including SU Aur, by
Konigl11 and Petrov19 . The resulting model reveals a disk with an inner
radius of @xmath au and a dust-to-gas ratio of @xmath . The inner radius
is in agreement with the literature values discussed above. The flaring
parameters @xmath and @xmath were fixed such that @xmath and found to be
@xmath and @xmath respectively. The dusty disk wind mechanism can
directly reproduce the flux ratio in the K-band, allowing for an good
visibility fit and an improved SED fit. As the disk wind rises above the
mid-plane it also shields the cooler parts of the disk, reducing the
longer wavelength flux compared to rim-only models. This was compensated
for in the models by increasing the scale height of the disk to @xmath
au at a radius of @xmath au. However, the implementation of the dusty
disk wind in this scenario is not completely physical, owing to the high
into-wind outflow rate of @xmath required. A potential solution in the
form of an ingoing late infall event onto SU Aur is presented in the
following chapter. The BK12 model also had the effect of flattening the
second visibility lobe, a feature found in other YSOs ( Tannirkulam08 ;
Setterholm18 ) and potentially opens powerful future modelling pathways
for these objects. The grain size of the silicate dust species that
produced the best fit was found to be @xmath with no evidence of larger
grains, as this addition resulted in a worse fit to the shape and
magnitude of the NIR excess, particularly the shape of the Silicate
feature around @xmath um. This is in contrast to other inner disk
studies where larger @xmath um grains are required ( Kama09 ; Kraus2009
; Davies18 ) .

All the inner rim models investigated differ from the model proposed by
Akeson05 whereby a vertical inner wall was combined with a small
optically thick inner gas disk very close to the star aligned with the
outer disk. This optically thick gas was implemented through very simple
black-body emission models and allowed the author to successfully
reproduced the observed NIR bump in excess flux. While TORUS could
implement this type of black-body emission, it is unable to simulate the
gas emission in a self-consistent physical manner owing to difficulty
obtaining optical properties of refractive elements. As such we do not
investigate such a model futher given such limited information.

### 6.7 Conclusions

This interferometric study of SU Aurigae has revealed the complex
geometry and composition of the disk around SU Aurigae. I summarise the
conclusions as follows:

-   I reconstruct an interferometric image that confirms the inclined
    disk described in literature. I see evidence for an asymmetry in the
    brightness distribution that can be explained by the exposure of the
    inner-rim on the far side of the disk and its obscuration on the
    near side due to inclination effects. The data set does not permit
    the imaging fidelity that would be needed to detect evidence of
    ongoing planetary formation within the inner disk, such as
    small-scale asymmetries, gaps or rings.

-   I see no evidence for a companion, in either the reconstructed
    images nor in the geometric model fitting procedures.

-   The simple geometric model fits reveal a disk of inclination @xmath
    along a minor axis position angle of @xmath and an inner radius of
    @xmath mas ( @xmath au). The disk is best modelled with a skewed
    ring which has a Gaussian ring width profile and sinusoidally
    modulated asymmetry. However, the poor @xmath of this model fit
    means the uncertainties quoted here are likely not representative of
    the true range of values.

-   Radiative transfer modelling shows that simple curved rim disk
    geometries of IN05 and THM07 cannot effectively model both the SED
    and visibility data. A deficit of NIR flux is obvious in the failure
    to reproduce the K-band observations.

-   A dusty disk wind scenario can successfully account for both the
    observed excess in the SED and the observed visibilities. The dusty
    disk wind scenario described here lifts material above the disk
    photosphere, thus exposing more dust grains to the higher
    temperatures close to the star responsible for the NIR excess.
    However, the high accretion rate required to reproduce the
    stellar-to-total flux ratio may make this scenario physically
    invalid.

-   The best-fit model (dusty disk wind model) suggests that the dust
    composition in the disk is dominated by medium sized grains ( @xmath
    ) with a sublimation temperature of @xmath K. Introducing larger
    grains results in a worse fit to the SED shape and NIR excess. The
    disk is also shown to be highly flared ( @xmath au at @xmath au).

-   The dusty disk wind model predicts a rather flat visibility profile
    at long baselines. This class of models avoids the pronounced
    visibility ’bounce’ that are associated with sharp edges in
    brightness distributions, as predicted by rim-only models.
    Therefore, these models may also open a pathway to physically model
    other YSOs that have been observed with @xmath m infrared
    long-baseline interferometry, such as AB Aur, MWC 275, and V1295 Aql
    ( Tannirkulam08 ; Setterholm18 ) which all observe very flat long
    baseline visibility profiles.

### 7.1 Introduction

Following my previous study of the object SU Aurigae, new observations
were obtained with the MIRC-X instrument. Since the publication of
Labdon19 several interesting and relevant studies by other authors were
made regarding SU Aur, in this introduction I shall introduce those
studies and this new study.

Spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of SU Aur by Petrov19 has
revealed that a dusty disk wind is the potential source of the
photometric variability in both SU Aur and RY Tau. The characteristic
time of change in the disk wind outflow velocity and the stellar
brightness indicate that the obscuring dust is located close to the
sublimation rim of the disk, in agreement with previous theoretical disk
wind models ( Bans12 ; Konigl11 ) .

Recent ALMA and SPHERE observations by Ginski21 reveal a significant
disk warp between the inner and out disks of @xmath . This misalignment
is shown to cause large shadows on the outer disk as it blocks light
from the central star. Their observations also suggest that SU Aur is
currently undergoing a late infall event with significant amounts of
material falling inwards from the outermost regions of the disk. Such
events have the opportunity to significantly impact the evolution of the
disk.

This study presents one of the first 6-telescope interferometric studies
of a YSO to date utilising state of the art observations covering a
wider range of baseline position angles and lengths (up to 331 m) in
addition to 50% greater resolution than previous works. Three different
modelling methodologies were used to interpret out data and to provide
direct comparisons to Labdon19 . (i) Image reconstruction was used to
obtain a model-independent representation of the data and to derive the
basic object morphology. (ii) Following this geometric model fitting
allowed us to gain an appreciation for the viewing geometry of the disk
by fitting Gaussian and ring models to the data. In addition, more
complex geometric modelling was used to explore the chromaticity of the
data. (iii) Finally, we combine interferometry and photometry to derive
physical parameters with radiative transfer analysis, where our focus is
on confirming the prescience of a dusty disk wind.

### 7.2 Observations

The CHARA array is a Y-shaped interferometric facility that comprises
six @xmath m telescopes. It is located at the Mount Wilson Observatory,
California, and offers operational baselines between @xmath and @xmath m
( Brummelaar05 ) . The MIRC-X instrument ( Kraus18 ) , a six-telescope
beam combiner, was used to obtain observations in the near-infrared
H-band ( @xmath ) between September and October 2018. We obtained 11
independent pointings of SU Aur, using a mixture of 5 and 6-telescope
configurations with maximum physical baseline of @xmath m corresponding
to a resolution of @xmath [milliarcseconds], where @xmath is the
observing wavelength and @xmath is the projected baseline. Details of
our observations, and the calibrator(s) observed for the target during
each observing session, are summarised in Table 7.1 . The uv plane
coverage that we achieved for the target is displayed in Figure 7.1 .
Our data covers an exceptionally wide range of baseline lengths and
position angles, making the data ideally suited for image
reconstruction.

The MIRC-X data were reduced using the standard pipeline developed at
the University of Michigan by (J.B. le Bouquin, N. Anugu, T. Gardner).
The measured visibilities and closure phases were calibrated using
interferometric calibrator stars observed alongside the target. Their
adopted uniform diameters (UDs) were obtained from JMMC SearchCal (
Bonneau06 ; Bonneau11 ) , and are listed in Table 7.1 .

Considering the short timescale over which the observations were taken
the effect of time dependencies/variability of the object is thought to
be minimal. However, care was taken to check for time dependencies in
the visibilities of baselines of similar length and position angle.
Variability in the NIR is known to be minimal ( Akeson05 ) , so any time
dependencies in the visibility amplitudes is likely geometric. However,
no significant time dependencies were discovered.

### 7.3 Image Reconstruction

The 6-telescope observations from MIRC-X lends itself to the process of
image reconstruction as the uv plane has been well sampled, though some
small gaps remain in the position angle coverage. Of particular
improtance is the large number of closure pahse measurements, which are
shown in Figure 7.2 . There are many different algorithms with which to
reconstruct images from interferometric data, but the process described
here involved the use of the Polychromatic Image Reconstruction Pipeline
(PIRP) which encompasses the @xmath reconstruction algorithm by MiRA08 .
For a detailed description of the @xmath image reconstruction algorithm
and its implementation, see Section 6.3.

The final image is shown in Figure 7.3 (top left panel), which also
shows the asymmetry in the intensity map (top right panel). The
asymmetry is calculated by rotating the image through @xmath and
subtracting it from the un-rotated image. It is this residual flux that
produces the non-zero closure phases, highlighting any areas of greater
emission within the disk. The inclination of the disk appears to be
greater than that found by Labdon19 with a similar minor-axis position
angle. There also appears to be a central bulge along the minor disk
axis likely caused by the over brightness of the star along this axis.
The asymmetry map clearly shows a bright ’ribbon’ along the south-west
of the outer disk, parallel to the major axis of the disk. This is
consistent with the asymmetry found by Labdon19 and is indicative of a
highly inclined disk where the far side of the inner rim in directly
exposed to the observer, while the nearside is obscured by flaring in
the outer disk.

The visibility and closure phase fits of the image reconstruction are
shown in Figure 7.2 (top panels) along with the residuals of the fit
(bottom panels). The combined visibility and closure phase reduced
chi-squared @xmath of the image reconstruction was found to be @xmath .

### 7.4 Geometric Modelling

In order to understand the geometry of the system one must consider the
application of simple geometric models. In this section we explore
several different approaches to modelling our data with both
non-chromatic ’grey’ models and techniques which explore the
chromaticity.

#### 7.4.1 Basic Geometric Models

The fitting of Gaussian and ring like distributions to the
interferometric variables allows highly accurate estimations of the
characteristic size, inclination and position angle of the object. In
all models the central star is modelled as a point source, which is an
acceptable assumption given the expected angular diameter of the star.
The disk parameters are then fitted in the RAPIDO (Radiative transfer
and Analytic modelling Pipeline for Interferometric Disk Observations)
framework which utilises the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler
corner to produce a fit and error estimate ( ForemanMackey16 ) . Three
disk models were employed, a standard Gaussian brightness distribution
which is characterised by its full-width-half-maximum (FWHM). Along with
two ring models, a sharp ring with a width fixed to 20% of the disk
radius ( @xmath ) and a ’skewed’ ring with a more diffuse radial profile
produced by convolving with a Gaussian with a FWHM, which is also a free
parameter. The skewed ring is also capable of modelling azimuthal
modulation or disk asymmetries, a detailed description of this model can
be found in Lazareff17 . In addition to the model specific parameters,
we also fitted in inclination ( @xmath ), minor-axis position angle (
@xmath ) and disk-to-total flux ratio ( @xmath ). As we see no evidence
of time variability in the data we are able to fit all data
simultaneously. The results from the simple geometric model fitting are
shown in Table 7.2 .

Out of the geometric models tested, the Gaussian model is considered to
be the best fit. Even though the skewed ring produced a slightly small
@xmath value for the closure phase and visibility measurements, we do
not consider this significant given the additional complexities in the
model. The Gaussian model finds a disk of FWHM @xmath which is inclined
at @xmath and a minor-axis position angle of @xmath . In addition, we
find that @xmath of the total flux originates from the disk in the H
band. This is consistent with measurements based on the infrared excess
of the spectral energy distribution (SED) ( Labdon19 ) .

The primary limitation of the simple geometric models described above is
that they are intrinsically ’grey’ in nature. Meaning they contain no
spectral information, in other words, all 6 spectral channels of MIRCX
are modelled using the same geometry, hence the large @xmath values
obtained in the fitting process. In order to better model the spectral
dependency of the visibility there are two geometric methods available.
The first, and simplest is to model each spectral channel with a
separate grey model. Figure 7.4 shows the best fit Gaussian model for
each spectral channel for each @xmath degree position angle bins. For
these models the @xmath and @xmath were fixed to @xmath as position
angles binned data can be considered orientation independent. The
elongation of the object can clearly be seen, indicating a minor axis
position angle of around @xmath . The wavelength dependence of the
visibilities is also obvious, with short wavelengths corresponding to
smaller ring radii. This is as expected given the hotter temperatures
found at smaller radii with blackbody peaks at shorter wavelengths. The
true temperature gradient of the inner disk can be found by applying
more complex temperature gradient models that are able to account for
observing wavelength.

#### 7.4.2 Temperature Gradient Models

The separation of the spectral channels for separate modelling is a tool
of limited use. A more physically correct model can be applied by
considering the temperature gradient of the disk. A temperature gradient
model (TGM) allows for the simultaneous fitting of interferometric and
photometric observables. It is built up by several rings extending from
an inner radius @xmath to an outer radius @xmath . Each ring is
associated with temperature and hence flux. Therefore, a model SED can
be computed by integrating over the resulting blackbody distributions
for each of the concentric rings. Such a model allows us to not only
build up a picture of the temperature profile, but also approximate the
position of the inner radius. The TGM is based upon @xmath where @xmath
is the temperature at the inner radius of the disk @xmath , and @xmath
is the exponent of the temperature gradient ( Kreplin20 ; Eisner11 ) . A
TGM represents an intrinsically geometrically thin disk. A point source
is used at the centre of each model to represent an unresolved star,
which is a reasonable approximation given the expected angular diameter
of @xmath ( Perez20 ) .

The inclination and position angle of the disk are maintained at fixed
values of @xmath and @xmath respectively, from the fitting of the
Gaussian distribution. This was done to reduce the number of free
parameters in the model. The fitting was undertaken using all of
visibility data shown in Figure 7.3 and all the SED points described in
Appendix B simultaneously. The fitting and error computation was once
again done using the MCMC sampler corner ( ForemanMackey16 ) . The
temperature gradient modelling finds an inner disk radius of @xmath
where the temperature is equivalent to @xmath and decreases with an
exponent of @xmath . These results are shown graphically in Figure 7.6 .

### 7.5 Radiative Transfer

We used the TORUS Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code ( Harries00 ) ,
allowing for the simultaneous fitting of visibility, closure phase and
photometric data to further constrain the geometry and physical dust
properties of the SU Aurigae circumstellar disk.

The models adopted here are based on the disk models used by Labdon19 ,
adapted to account for the higher inclination and different observing
wavelength. In these TORUS simulations, the dust was allowed to
vertically settle and the dust sublimation radius was left as a free
parameter, allowing the inner rim radius to define itself based on
well-defined rules of the Lucy99 iterative method to determine the
location and the temperature structure of the whole disk. For a full
description of the disk model within TORUS see Section 6.5.

The dusty disk wind model is adapted from Bans12 . This mechanism is
based on the presence of a large-scale, ordered magnetic field which
threads the disk along which disk material is flung out. The high
magnetic pressure gradient above the disk surface accelerates the
material which is then collimated through the azimuthal and poloidal
field components ( Bans12 ) . These centrifugally driven winds are
highly efficient at distributing density above and below the plane of
the disk, carrying angular momentum away from the disk surface. A full
description of the implementation within the TORUS radiative transfer
code can be found in Labdon19 .

The disk model adopted follows the curved inner rim prescription of
Isella05 with a density dependent sublimation radius whereby grains
located in the disk midplane are better shielded due to higher densities
and so can exist closer to the central star than grains in the less
dense upper layers. A full summary of the disk parameters can be found
in Table LABEL:table:torus . The key difference in the models described
here compared to ( Labdon19 ) is the grain size adopted. Here we adopt a
smaller grain size of @xmath , which in turn leads to a slightly smaller
inner radius of @xmath and a hotter inner rim temperature of @xmath . In
order to improve the SED fit at longer wavelengths we also adopt a
smaller scale height of @xmath at @xmath .

The presence of additional IR flux is once again required to fit both
the visibilities and the SED, which is implemented in the form of a
dusty disk wind. The absence of a disk wind fails to reproduce IR excess
across both the H and K bands, with insufficient NIR disk flux. A disk
wind is required to eject more hot dust above the midplane of the disk
where it is directly exposed to stellar radiation which is reprocessed
as an IR excess. As seen in the SED in Figure 7.5 the current model
overestimates the flux in the mid/far-IR, it is thought that this might
be related to the disk warp predicted by Ginski21 and further modelling
is required.

The detailed model fits are shown in Figure 7.8 , where the visibilities
are split by position angle in @xmath bins. The green curves show the
basic disk model without a dusty disk wind component, while the red
curves show the same disk with the added disk wind component described
above. The disk wind model provides a far superior fit to the
observations, being able to successfully reproduce the NIR excess. The
adopted disk wind parameters are the very similar as those used in
Labdon19 , including the into-wind accretion rate of @xmath .
Considering a typical on-to-star accretion rate to into-wind accretion
ratio of @xmath , this level of transport is perhaps unphysically high
given the age of the star.

The final computed image is shown in Figure 7.3 (middle left panel) and
shows the clear asymmetry originating from the inclination in the
asymmetry map in the same figure (middle left panel). In order to
approximate what this computed image would look like if observed at the
same resolution as the original observations, we computed synthetic
visibility and closure phases based on the radiative transfer images.
Artificial noise and error bars were computed to be representative of
the original data and to ensure an accurate representation. These
synthetic observable were then reconstructed in the same manner as the
original data, as described in Section 7.3 . Care was taken to ensure
the constancy of the reconstruction parameters for both the real and
synthetic observables. The reconstructed TORUS image is also shown in
Figure 7.3 (bottom right panel), and shows clear similarities with both
the original TORUS image and the image reconstructed from the original
data. A comparison between the observed and model closure phases is
shown in Figure 7.9 , the TORUS model is shown to recreaste the scale of
the closure phases (considering the error bars) well with relatively
small residuals.

### 7.6 Discussion

Our extensive observations and analysis of the circumstellar environment
of SU Aurigae have revealed the details of the inner disk in
unprecedented detail. The wide variety of techniques used to analyse our
interferometric data allows us to precisely define the disk
characteristics.

Image reconstruction is a crucial, model independent, method of analysis
which is ideally suited to our dataset with extensive uv and baseline
coverage. Our analysis reveals a highly elliptical shape, indicative of
an object with a high inclination. There appears to be a central bulge
to the disk, however this feature is not thought to be physical but
rather a manifestation of the brightness of the central star combined
with the width of the disk at this point. The thinner ’arms’ of the
image are thought to be a depiction of the far-side of the disk rim
which is un-obscured by the outer disk. This is confirmed by the
asymmetry map shown alongside the image is Figure 7.3 . There is a
significant asymmetric feature in the form of a thin brightness on the
south-eastern edge of the disk. The unique shape of this feature
indicates that this is again caused by the high inclination obscuring
the nearside disk rim. The effect of an inclined disk on the observed
brightness distribution is described extensively by Jang13 and
accurately describes the observations here. The scale and shape of the
image is similar to that of Labdon19 , with a slightly higher inclined
viewing angle. We consider the images of this work to be the more
accurate depiction of SU Aur given the higher quality observations,
taken over a much shorter timescale, with the added detail and
resolution this entails.

Although geometric modelling is much more constrained in the geometries
it can explore, in does provide a more quantitative view of the disk. It
was found that the model which best fit our data was a simple Gaussian
distribution with a point source representing the star. A Gaussian model
is consistent with other work, both on this object by Labdon19 , but
also in other YSO studies such as the survey by Lazareff17 who find that
little under half of their 51 objects can be modelled by a Gaussian
structure. Although the data quality of this work is variable, with many
objects only modelled on a sparse uv coverage, meaning more objects may
appear Gaussian in nature than truly are. The Gaussian fitted in this
work has a FWHM of @xmath ( @xmath ) at an inclination of @xmath at a
minor axis position angle of @xmath with a stellar-to-total flux ratio
of @xmath . The reduced @xmath value for the visibilities is @xmath and
@xmath for the closure phases, which are equivalent to @xmath for this
centro-symmetric model. These values are in agreement with the
literature values of Akeson05 who find a K band radius of @xmath au and
an inclination of @xmath . Similar values for the inclination in
literature are ~ @xmath and ~ @xmath found by Unruh04 ; Jeffers14
respectively. The minor axis position angle derived here is
significantly greater than the literature values of @xmath and @xmath
found by Akeson05 ; Jeffers14 . This difference is likely due to either:
The poor uv coverage and lack of longer baselines in previous
interferometric studies, both of which make estimating the position
angle and inclination particularly unreliable. Other non-interferometric
studies focus on the outer disk, rather than the inner au-scale regions.

The geometric modelling results are broadly similar to those presented
in our previous work ( Labdon19 ) where an inclination of @xmath and
minor axis position angle of @xmath were found and the data were
marginally better described by a ring-like brightness distribution. The
values and models presented here are considered to be more accurate due
high precision observations and significantly smaller potential for
temporal variations. These values are also consistent with observations
of the outer disk by Ginski21 where dark shadows are observed in
scattered light origination from a significant disk warp between the
inner and outer regions. On larger scales the near-side of disk is seen
to the north-east, in our observations it is seen to the south west.
Figure 7.10 shows the comparison between the SPHERE image of Ginski21
and the reconstructed image from this work. The SPHERE image probes
scattered polarised IR light on significantly larger scales.

In modelling the temperature gradient of SU Aur we can gain an
appreciation for spectral dependence of our interferometric variables
across the 6 spectral channels of MIRCX. Our modelling finds a disk
which extends down to @xmath where the temperature is equivalent to
@xmath . The presence of such hot dust is unlikely for silicate and
graphite domianted disks and potentially suggests the prescence of
refractory grain species, likely at a much lower dust to gas ratio.
However, these results cannot confirm this, but simply find evidence of
emission conistent with such temperatures. The temperature gradient and
decreases with an exponent of @xmath . The outer edge of this
temperature regime was found to be @xmath , showing this this
prescription only covers the very innermost regions of the disk.
Modelling outer regions of the disk is beyond the scope of this paper,
as our NIR interferometric data does not cover emission from these
regions. The temperature gradient exponent found here lies between two
established models from literature. That of Pringle81 who find that a
steady state, optically-thick accretion disk heated by viscous processes
will exhibit an exponent of @xmath and of Kenyon87 ; Dullemond04 who
show that a flared disk heated by reprocessed stellar radiation alone
will exhibit an exponent of @xmath or less ( Chiang97 ) . As such, we
infer that the circumstellar environment of SU Aurigae is not heated by
stellar radiation alone, but additional heating processes must also be
present in the inner disk. One potential issue with these
interpritations is that the NIR regions probed in this work are only
sensitive to the upper layers of the disk, as the disk is optically
thick in the NIR. As physical disks are not vertically isothermal the
tempersature between the midplane and upper layers will likely differ.
However, Adams87 ; Kenyon87 find that for the innmost regions of a disk
the discrepancy between midplane and surface temperature gradients is
very small.

The radiative transfer modelling presented in this paper is heavily
based on LA19. For a detailed discussion of the motivation behind
certain choices, particularly in relation to the shape of the inner rim,
we recommend the reader see there. In this work we are able to achieve a
similar SED fit to LA19, even with the adoption of a smaller @xmath
grain size. The smaller grain size is in line with previous radiative
transfer work of SU Aur by Akeson05 . The smaller grain size results in
a smaller and hotter inner rim which now extends down to @xmath at a
temperature of @xmath . This is within the uncertainties of values
predicted by the temperature gradient modelling and is roughly
consistent with older literature values of @xmath and @xmath by Akeson05
and Jeffers14 respectively. The flaring parameters @xmath and @xmath
were fixed such that @xmath and found to be @xmath and @xmath
respectively. Similarly to LA19, a dusty disk wind is required in order
to fit both the SED across the NIR and visibilities as shown in Figure
7.8 . A dusty disk wind allows material to be listed from the disk
surface along magnetic field lines where it can reprocess stellar
radiation to contribute to the NIR excess. However, the implementation
of the dusty disk wind in this scenario is not completely physical,
owing to the high into-wind outflow rate of @xmath required. If one
assumes an outflow to accretion ratio of @xmath the resulting
onto-star-accretion rate is greater than those typically found in
T Tauri stars. In particular spectroscopic measurments of the accretion
rate of SU Aur by Calvet04 find a moderate rate of @xmath However, the
suggestion that SU Aur is undergoing a late stage infall event could be
a potential explanation for such a high level of mass transport through
the system.

The simplest way to directly compare the analytical methods employed in
this work, is through the images produced. Figure 7.3 shows a collage of
the images produced by the geometric modelling, image reconstruction and
radiative transfer methods. It clearly shows the similarities between
the images all with very similar inclinations and position angles with
asymmetries oriented in the same direction. The asymmetries all appear
to be the result of the high inclination of the disk causing the
near-side inner rim to be shadowed by the flared outer disk. The lowest
panel of Figure 7.3 shows an image reconstructed from synthetic
visibilities and closure phases obtained from the radiative transfer
image. Care was taken to ensure the observables were matched in baseline
length and position angle and detector mode, while the image
reconstruction process was exactly that described in Section 7.3

### 7.7 Conclusions

This interferometric study of SU Aurigae has revealed the complex
geometry and composition of the disk around SU Aurigae. We summarise our
conclusions as follows:

-   We reconstruct an interferometric image that confirms the inclined
    disk described in literature. We see evidence for an asymmetry in
    the brightness distribution that can be explained by the exposure of
    the inner-rim on the far side of the disk and its obscuration on the
    near side due to inclination effects.

-   Our simple geometric model fits show that the circumstellar
    environment is best modelled as a Gaussian distribution with a disk
    of inclination @xmath along a minor axis position angle of @xmath
    and an FWHM of @xmath ( @xmath ). Such geometry is consistent with
    strong disk shadows observed in the outer disk originating from a
    disk warp.

-   We model the radial temperature profile of the inner disk and find a
    disk which extends down to @xmath where the temperature is
    equivalent to @xmath and decreases with an exponent of @xmath .

-   A dusty disk wind scenario is still required to account for both the
    observed excess in the SED and the observed visibilities. The dusty
    disk wind scenario described here lifts material above the disk
    photosphere, thus exposing more dust grains to the higher
    temperatures close to the star responsible for the NIR excess. The
    high accretion rate required to reproduce the stellar-to-total flux
    ratio could be explained by a late stage infall event.

-   Our best-fit model (dusty disk wind model) suggests that the dust
    composition in the disk is dominated by small grains ( @xmath ) with
    a sublimation temperature of @xmath K. Introducing larger grains
    results in a worse fit to the SED shape and NIR excess. The disk is
    also shown to be highly flared with a scale height of @xmath au at
    @xmath au.

## Chapter 8 Viscous Heating and Boundary Layer Accretion in the Disk of
an Outbursting Young Star ^(†) ^(†) Large parts of this chapter are
published in Labdon20

FU Orionis is the archetypal FUor star, a subclass of YSO that undergo
rapid brightening events, often gaining 4-6 magnitudes on timescales of
days. This brightening is often associated with a massive increase in
accretion; one of the most ubiquitous processes in astrophysics from
planets and stars to super-massive black holes. We present multi-band
interferometric observations of the FU Ori circumstellar environment,
including the first J-band interferometric observations of a YSO. We
investigate the morphology and temperature gradient of the inner-most
regions of the accretion disk around FU Orionis. We aim to characterise
the heating mechanisms of the disk and comment on potential outburst
triggering processes.

Recent upgrades to the MIRC-X instrument at the CHARA array allowed the
first dual-band J and H observations of YSOs. Using baselines up to
331 m, we present high angular resolution data of a YSO covering the
near-infrared bands J, H, and K. The unprecedented spectral range of the
data allows us to apply temperature gradient models to the innermost
regions of FU Ori.

We spatially resolve the innermost astronomical unit of the disk and
determine the exponent of the temperature gradient of the inner disk to
@xmath . This agrees with theoretical work that predicts @xmath for
actively accreting, steady state disks, a value only obtainable through
viscous heating within the disk, assuming it is flared. We find a disk
which extends down to the stellar surface at @xmath where the
temperature is found to be @xmath indicating boundary layer accretion as
the disk is continuous down to the stellar surface. We find a disk
inclined at @xmath with a minor-axis position angle of @xmath . We
demonstrate that J-band interferometric observations of YSOs are
feasible with the MIRC-X instrument at CHARA. The temperature gradient
power-law derived for the inner disk is consistent with theoretical
predictions for steady-state, optically thick, viscosly heated accretion
disks.

### 8.1 Introduction

Accretion onto astronomical objects is one of the most fundamental
processes in astrophysics and facilitates mass transport onto a wide
range of astrophysical objects, from planets and stars to super-massive
black holes ( Lin96 ) . The mass transport proceeds through accretion
disks, where viscosity transports angular momentum outwards, thus
enabling the mass infall ( Pringle72 ) . A key prediction is that the
disk viscosity should actively heat the disk, where the radial
temperature profile has been predicted as far back as the 1970’s (
Shakura73 ; Shibazaki75 ; Hartmann85 ) .

The radial temperature gradient of circumstellar disks are determined by
the heating mechanisms that power them. The two primary heating
mechanisms in protoplanetary disks are the reprocessing of stellar
radiation and viscous heating ( DAlessio05 ) . Stellar radiation is
reprocessed through absorption, re-emission, and scattering of photons
and is most effective in the outer layers of the disk owing to the
optical depth of material ( Natta01 ) . Viscous heating on the other
hand is thought to be most prevelant in the mid-plane, owing to higher
densities of material, where it is thought to be driven by turbulence
and instabilities in the disk material, such as magneto-rotation
instabilities (MRI) ( Balbus98 ) . However, the presence and nature of
viscosity is highly debated and relatively unconstrained by current
observational data.

The appreciation of accretion and viscosity processes in young stellar
objects (YSOs) is vital to the understanding of both star- and
planet-formation mechanisms. Active accretion disks have been observed
around a wide range of YSO classes, however YSOs are known to be 10-100
times less luminous than expected from steady-state accretion scenarios.
Particularly given the accretion rates of the order @xmath to @xmath
observed around many YSOs. This raises the possibility that accretion is
not consistent across the early stages of stellar evolution, but is
episodic ( Kenyon95 ; Evans09 ) . Such scenarios may manifest in
outbursting events.

Many stars are known to undergo episodic accretion events on sifferent
timescales, such as EX Lupi objects which undergo short outbursts on
regular periods. However, it is FU Orionis (FUor) stars that are perhaps
the best known. FUors are characterised by rapid brightening events (
Audard14 ) followed by a protracted period of dimming, on the order of
decades to centuries to return to the quiescence state ( Hartmann96 ;
Herbig07 ; kra16 ) . In such an outburst the accretion rates can
increase to @xmath . It is now thought that most YSOs stars exhibit
episodic accretion, undergoing at least one or more outburst events
throughout their lifetime ( Hartmann96 ; Audard14 ) .

The triggering mechanism of outbursts in FUor-type stars is not well
understood. Various scenarios have been proposed to explain the massive
increase in accretion rate seen in these objects. Vorobyov05 ;
Vorobyov06 propose gravitational instabilities on large scales cause the
disk to fragment and for clumps of material to fall onto the central
star. Bell94 suggest that a thermal instability in the very inner
regions ( @xmath au) could be sufficient to cause outbursts of this
magnitude. Bonnell92 propose that a binary companion on a highly
eccentric orbit could perturb the disk and cause repeated outburst of
accretion. Similarly, Reipurth04 suggest that FUor stars are newly
created binary systems, where the two stars become bound following the
breakup of larger multiple systems. Such a scenario leads to the
ejection of companions and the rapid infall of material. However, given
the limited number of known FUors there is little consensus on the FUor
outburst triggering mechanism.

FU Orionis (FU Ori) is the archetypal FUor object located in the
Lambda-Orionis star forming region at a distance of @xmath (
BailerJones18 ) , obtained from GAIA parallax measurements. FU Ori is
known to be a binary system with an actively accreting companion located
@xmath (200 au at 416 pc) to the South. Despite being ~ @xmath mag
fainter (in the V band), FU Ori S is thought to be the more massive
object ( @xmath ) ( Beck12 ) , as it is highly embedded, hence only
appearing fainter and less massive. Meanwhile the mass of the Northern
component has been estimated to @xmath based on modelling of the
Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) Zhu07 . In 1937 FU Ori N underwent a
rapid brightening event whereby its brightness increased from @xmath to
@xmath ( Herbig66 ; Clarke05 ) in the photographic system (similar
spectral response to Johnson B filter). Since reaching a peak shortly
after outburst its magnitude has decreased steadily at around @xmath per
year in B band ( @xmath ).

FU Ori is one of the best-studied YSOs due to its current brightness and
unique nature. Scattered light observations by Takami14 and Laws20 with
Subaru and GPI respectively reveal a large spiral arm structure in the
north-west of the disk extending around 200 au that has been attributed
to a gravitational instability in the outer disk. Additionally, they
reveal a stripe/shadow in the Northern disk and a diffuse outflow
extending to the east, which is tentatively attributed to a jet in polar
direction. Eisner11 observed FU Ori using the Keck interferometer in
high resolution K-band mode ( @xmath , @xmath ). They found a
temperature gradient of @xmath for the inner disk using a single
baseline. Additionally, Liu19 presented medium resolution GRAVITY
observations ( @xmath , @xmath ) which they model as an off-centre
face-on Gaussian object. They also highlight @xmath and CO absorption
features that are consistent with a @xmath accretion disk model. ALMA
observations taken by Perez20 show a disk inclined at @xmath at a
position angle of @xmath , both values are aligned to a disk detection
around the southern component. Using methods outlined by Zhu07 , Perez20
were able to constrain the stellar parameters of the northern component
based on the disk geometry. They find a stellar mass of @xmath , with a
mass accretion rate of @xmath . They go further to derive an inner disk
radius of @xmath or @xmath . Mid-infrared (MIR) interferometry in the
N-band ( @xmath ) and SED analysis by Quanz06 derive a temperature
gradient for the outer disk ( @xmath ) which is in good agreement to
what can be found for vertically isothermal flared disks in theoretical
work ( Kenyon87 ) .

In non-outbursting low-mass YSO (T Tauri stars) the mass-infall is
believed to proceed through magnetospheric accretion columns operating
between the inner disk and the photosphere ( Bouvier07 ) . It is not yet
understood how the accretion geometry differs in highly-accreting FUors,
which also limits our understanding of the outburst-triggering
mechanisms. In order to further our understanding of these processes I
have conducted the first tri-waveband NIR interferometric study of a YSO
at the CHARA array using MIRC-X in the J and H bands. These include
simultaneous J- and H-band observations using MIRC-X, the first of their
kind. This data is complemented with observations in the K-band from the
"CLassic Interferometry with Multiple Baselines" (CLIMB) beam combiner.
The observations are introduced in Section 8.2 . The modelling
techniques and temperature gradient analysis are shown in Section 8.3.3
. The details of the companion search are outlined in Section 8.3.4 and
I discuss the implications and draw conclusions in Sections 8.4 and 8.5
, respectively.

### 8.2 Observations

To collect the data for this multi-wavelength study, a variety of
instruments operating at a range of wavelengths were employed. A summary
of the observations is provided in Table 8.1 and the resultant
uv-coverage is shown in Figure 8.1 .

#### 8.2.1 CHARA/MIRC-X H-band Observations

The primary instrument used in this study is the "Michigan InfraRed
Combiner-eXeter" (MIRC-X), which is a six-telescope beam combiner
instrument located at the CHARA array. The CHARA array is a Y-shaped
interferometric facility that comprises six @xmath m telescopes. It is
located at the Mount Wilson Observatory, California, and offers
operational baselines between @xmath and @xmath m ( Brummelaar05 ) . The
MIRC-X instrument ( Monnier04 ; Kraus18 ; Anugu20 ) is recording data
routinely in H-band ( @xmath with @xmath ) since late 2017 (first
results in Kraus20 ) .

Overall I obtained 4 independent H-band pointings of FU Ori with MIRC-X,
using a mixture of 5 and 6-telescope configurations in bracketed
calibrator-science concatenation sequences. A maximum physical baseline
of @xmath m was used, corresponding to a maximum resolution of @xmath
[milliarcseconds], where @xmath is the observing wavelength and @xmath
is the projected baseline.

The data were reduced using the MIRC-X data reduction pipeline v1.2.0 ¹
¹ 1 https://gitlab.chara.gsu.edu/lebouquj/mircx_pipeline to produce
calibrated squared visibilities and closure phases. The MIRC-X detector
is susceptible to bias in the bispectrum estimation as pointed out by
Basden04 . The pipeline corrects for this with a method similar to
Appendix C of that paper. The measured visibilities and closure phases
were calibrated using interferometric calibrator stars observed
alongside the target; the calibrators are listed in Table 8.1 . The
adopted uniform diameters (UDs) were obtained from JMMC SearchCal (
Bonneau06 ; Bonneau11 ) .

#### 8.2.2 CHARA/MIRC-X J+H band Observations

Recent developments have allowed the wavelength of MIRC-X to be extended
to allow for simultaneous H and J-band observations through the
implementation of longitudinal dispersion compensators (LDCs) to correct
for atmospheric dispersion between the two bands ( Berger03 ) . LDCs
consist of a wedge of SF-10 glass which is moved across the beam to
increase or decrease the thickness of glass depending on the total
airpath of the interferometric system. At the time, the LDCs were
tracked manually resulting in sub-optimal fringe contrast in the J band,
however a consistent approach was used across calibrator and science
stars to ensure accurate calibration could be obtained. Such
observations were conducted for the first time in November 2019, with
automated LDC control now in the late stage of development ( Anugu20 ) .

The data presented in this paper represents the first successful J-band
interferometric observations of a YSO. These dual-band observations
correspond to 14 spectral channels across wavelengths @xmath and @xmath
. The gap in the band pass is due to the presence of the CHARA metrology
laser at around @xmath , this was removed using a narrow-band ’notch’
filter.

I obtained two J+H band pointings on FU Ori with MIRC-X in 2019, using a
4-telescope configuration in CAL-SCI concatenation sequences. Only a
4-telescope configuration corresponding to the lowest spatial frequency
fringes can be used for dual-band observations. Recording with 5 or 6
telescopes would result in the highest spatial frequency being
undersampled (sub-Nyquist) on the detector. Of the available baselines,
a maximum physical baseline of @xmath m was used corresponding to a
maximum resolution of @xmath .

These data were reduced using an adapted version of the MIRC-X data
reduction pipeline v1.2.0. The UDs of the calibrator stars were obtained
from JMMC SearchCal ( Bonneau06 ; Bonneau11 ) . The spectral dependence
of the UDs between the J and H bands is small enough to be considered
negligible by the calibration pipeline.

#### 8.2.3 VLT/PIONIER H-band Observations

FU Ori was recorded with the PIONIER instrument PIONIER11 . PIONIER is a
four telescope beam combiner operating in the H-band ( @xmath ) at the
VLTI. Data was obtained in December 2017 without a dispersive element
(FREE mode) and reduced using the standard PNDRS pipeline ( JBLB2011 ) .

#### 8.2.4 VLTI/CLIMB K-band Observations

I present observations obtained with the CLIMB instrument ( Brummelaar13
) , also located at the CHARA array. CLIMB is a three telescope beam
combiner that was used to obtain near-infrared K-band data ( @xmath )
between November 2009 and October 2011. The CLIMB data were reduced
using pipelines developed at the University of Michigan that are
optimised for recovering faint fringes from low visibility data.

Archival K-band data were also available from the Palomar Testbed
Interferometer (PTI, Colavita99 ) from 1998 to 2008 using a
two-telescope beam combiner on 3 different physical baselines between
@xmath and @xmath m. The data on FU Ori was published in Malbet98 ;
Malbet05 . These additional measurements complement the CHARA
observations in the short to intermediate baseline range; the full uv
coverage is shown in Figure 8.1 .

#### 8.2.5 Photometric Observations

Photometric observations were collected from a variety of sources in
order to build up the spectral energy distribution (SED) of FU Ori.
Where possible, care was taken to minimize the time difference between
observations and the number of instruments used. In particular,
photometric data taken during the 1998 to 2019 period of the
interferometric observations was considered whenever possible. A full
list of the photometric observations used can be seen in Appendix C .

### 8.3 Modelling and Results

#### 8.3.1 Presentation of Results

The closure phases and squared visibilities obtained for all instruments
are shown in Figures 8.2 and 8.3 , respectively. The visibilities are
split into position angle bins of @xmath and coloured according to
wavelength.

The majority of the observations are contained within the MIRC-X,
PIONIER and GRAVITY data which were taken over the relatively short
period of 3 years. Hence the effect of photometric variability in the
NIR of the object is thought to be minimal. On the other hand, the CLIMB
and PTI observations were taken over a significantly longer timescale,
were a small amount of photometric variability may be expected. Based on
the established decreasing trend in the magnitude of 0.0125 per year in
the B band, the expected drop change in the visibility based on the
changing stellar-to-disk flux ratio between 1998 and 2019 is 0.045.
However, I am confident that the large error bars caused by the poor
signal-to-noise of these observations will successfully account for
variability on the visibility and closure phase measurements. Even so,
care was taken to check for time dependencies in the visibilities of
baselines of similar length and position angle. K-band squared
visibilities were binned according to the year of the observation and
compared with each other. Each night of H-band data was compared
separately to other nights. While J-band data from MIRC-X could not be
compared directly, the H-band data taken simultaneously could be
compared with other nights. None of these checks revealed any time
variability in the data beyond the noise level, hence all
interferometric data can be studied together. Also, I fitted the model
to the post-2009 interferometric data alone and obtain values that are
consistent on the @xmath -level with those obtained from fitting the
complete data. This confirms that any potential temporal variability
does not affect the results significantly.

The closure phases (Fig 8.2 ) are consistent with @xmath within the
error bars, indicating a centro-symmetric brightness distribution. The
reduced chi-square for the closure phase measurements ( @xmath , see
definition in Kraus2009 ) for a centro-symmetric model (i.e. with
closure phases of @xmath along all triangles) is @xmath .

#### 8.3.2 Simple Geometric Models

As a first step for interpreting the recorded interferometric
observables I fitted simple geometric models to the data. This allows
for the characteristic size, inclination and position angle of the
object to be derived. I employ a Gaussian model within the RAPIDO
(Radiative transfer and Analytic modelling Pipeline for Interferometric
Disk Observations) framework. RAPIDO utilises the Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) sampler emcee ( emcee13 ) to produce a fit and error
estimate. The Gaussian model employed is a ’grey’ model, in that it
contains no spectral information. As such the three wavebands of the
observations were fitted separately. In addition to a Gaussian model a
secondary unresolved, extended component was also required. The free
parameters of the model were the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of the
Gaussian, the inclination (INC), minor axis position angle (PA) and the
flux of the unresolved, extended component ( @xmath ), which is measured
as a percentage of the total flux in the model.

Table 8.2 summarises the results of the Gaussian fitting. The
inclination ( @xmath ) and position angle ( @xmath ) of the object are
consistent across all three wavebands as expected. The size of the disk
as characterised by the FWHM of the Gaussian shows an increase in size
with increasing wavelength from 0.38 mas in the J-band to 0.60 mas in
the K-band. This is expected given that longer wavelengths probes cooler
regions of the disk, found at a larger distance from the central star.
The flux contained within the extended component also shows a spectral
dependency with a lower flux contrast at shorter wavelengths of only
@xmath in the J band compared to @xmath in the K band.

A Gaussian model is intrinsically centro-symmetric and as such has a
closure phase of @xmath across all triangles. This is a very good
approximation to the observations, were very small closure phase signals
are measured. A reduced @xmath value for the closure phases of @xmath
was calculated for a Gaussian model fitted to all data.

#### 8.3.3 Disk Temperature Structure and Geometry

The primary limitation of the Gaussian models employed is the lack of
spectral information within the intrinsically ’grey’ model. As the
interferometric data covers three wavebands it is vital to account for
the spectral dependency, as each wavelength channel probes a different
temperature regime and hence a different disk radius.

A temperature gradient model (TGM) allows for the simultaneous fitting
of interferometric and photometric observables. It is built up by
several rings extending from an inner radius @xmath to an outer radius
@xmath . Each ring is associated with temperature and hence flux.
Therefore, a model SED can be computed by integrating over the resulting
blackbody distributions for each of the concentric rings. Such a model
allows us to not only to build up a picture of the temperature profile,
but also approximate the position of the inner radius. The TGM is based
upon @xmath where @xmath is the temperature at the inner radius of the
disk @xmath , and @xmath is the exponent of the temperature gradient (
Kreplin20 ; Eisner11 ) . While a model lacks any flaring, in this case
it traces the surface layers of the disk as observed in the infrared. A
point source is used at the centre of each model to represent an
unresolved star, which is a reasonable approximation given the expected
diameter (from the mass estimate) of the star of @xmath resulting in an
angular diameter of @xmath ( Perez20 ) .

In the previous section I was able to reliably constrain the inclination
and position angle of the disk for the first time. The geometric
modelling finds an inclination of @xmath and a minor axis position angle
of @xmath measured East from North. These values were fixed in the
fitting of temperature gradient model in order to reduce the number of
free parameters. The fitting was undertaken using all the visibility
data, shown in Figure 8.3 and all of the SED shown in Figure 8.5 , which
is constructed from the photometry detailed in Appendix C . Interstellar
extinction was taken as @xmath as described by Pueyo12 and was used to
redden the model results during fitting. The SED of FU Ori is unusual in
the context of YSOs, in that it is almost completely dominated by disk
flux even across the visible where the central star only contributes
@xmath . This is due to the lack of gap between the star and disk
resulting in very hot material close to the star, which dominates the
emission from the relatively small central star. The fitting and error
computation is done using the MCMC sampler corner ( ForemanMackey16 ) to
produce corner plots from which parameter degeneracies and errors can be
analysed. This is ideal for fitting many parameters simultaneously in a
consistent manner. Fig. 8.4 shows the posterior distributions, local
minima can be seen in several parameters, the signifcance of these were
explored by limiting the range of the search, however, the minima were
ruled to be insigificant sompared to the global minima. The final
results of fitting the temperature gradient are shown in Table 8.3 .

Figure 8.6 shows the best-fit temperature gradient model which
corresponds to an inner disk radius of @xmath with a temperature of
@xmath and an exponent @xmath . By design, the brightness distribution
computed from the model of a geometrically thin disk with a radial
temperature gradient is intrinsically centro-symmetric, meaning all
closure phase measurements are equivalent to @xmath . There is a slight
discrepency between the temperature gradient of the inner disk derived
here and the disk beyond @xmath taken from Quanz06 . At @xmath there is
a temperature difference of @xmath with the inner disk regieme producing
a slightly cooler temperature, but this is within the error margins.

#### 8.3.4 Companion Constraints

In addition to disk modelling I undertook a companion search, in order
to search for a putative, previously-undetected companion within the
field of view of the observations. FU Ori is a known binary system,
however the southern component, located at a separation of @xmath is
outside the field of view of all interferometric observations. The
companion search was undertaken using the RAPIDO model-fitting code and
a companion finder extension described in Davies18 . This module
computes a grid of model, where a point source is added to the best-fit
model described in section 8.3.3 . The resulting @xmath detection
significance map allows us to estimate the detection significance, or to
derive an upper detection limit if no significant companion is detected.

A companion search was undertaken separately on the two epochs of MIRC-X
H-band data taken in November 2018 and November 2019. Only these dates
were chosen as they offer good uv-coverage over the shortest possible
time period (1 night), making it ideal to conduct companion searches
upon. On the other hand, the supplementary data (MIRC-X J-band data,
CLIMB K-band data, and PIONIER H- band data) is taken over many years
and on fewer baselines, so individual epochs contain sparse uv-coverage.

In order for a detection to be considered significant the p-value must
be greater than @xmath . This search finds that the non-zero flux
solution for a companion is not significant with a p-value of @xmath .
Following the non-detection the upper limits to the flux of any
companion can be calculated for each (x, y) positions in the
field-of-view (grid search process described in Davies18 ). The maximum
flux contribution from any companion that could remain undetected by the
observations is @xmath of FU Ori’s total flux in H-band within @xmath to
@xmath mas. Assuming a standard mass luminosity relation of @xmath for
low mass stars, this flux contrast corresponds to a maximum companion
mass of @xmath .

### 8.4 Discussion

I have presented the first J-band interferometric observations of a
young stellar object, thus demonstrating the feasibility of such
observations, particularly in the context of multi-waveband
interferometry. The J-band has been a relatively untapped resource in
interferometry, and the feasibility of these observations is of great
interest to the wider scientific community. The J-band has the potential
to not only be used in YSO studies to examine the sublimation rims and
the potential for optically-thick gas inside the sublimation radius, but
also in stellar photosphere studies, as a waveband which is relatively
free from molecular opacities.

By investigating the circumstellar environment of FU Ori I have explored
the morphology and temperature gradient of the inner disk and greatly
improved the constraints on the parameters of both the star and the
disk. Geometric modelling finds a disk inclined at @xmath with a minor
axis position angle of @xmath . This inclination estimate is
significantly more face-on than earlier estimates of @xmath and @xmath
that were based on a variety of techniques, including SED analysis and
near/mid-IR interferometry Malbet05 ; Zhu08 ; Quanz06 . Calvet91 derived
an inclination of @xmath based on the CO line-width and Liu19 found
FU Ori to be face-on based on NIR closure phases with GRAVITY. However,
previous interferometric studies were based on very limited uv-coverage
consisting solely of baselines below 100 m and at a single wavelength,
making these estimates less accurate compared to the comprehensive
uv-coverage. The limitations in uv-coverage of earlier interferometric
studies resulted likely also in the wide spread of minor axis position
angle estimates that range from @xmath ( Quanz06 ) , @xmath ( Malbet05 )
. In addition, many literature values are at odds with the tentative
detection of a jet/outflow detected on larger scales by Takami18 and
Laws20 (features C and D respectively). The putative jet/outflow feature
was detected in scattered light imagery obtained with Subaru and GPI,
respectively. Assuming the minor disk axis is aligned with the stellar
polar axis and hence the jet position angle, a position angle of @xmath
would be expected. Compared to @xmath measured here, I find a
discrepancy of almost @xmath . I see no evidence of such a jet in the
continuum imaging on smaller scales.

Temperature gradient models were used in order to fit the spectral
dependence of the data. These models allow for the simultaneous fitting
of the interferometric data and the SED. Application of these models
finds a disk that extends down to the stellar surface at @xmath (stellar
radius of @xmath corresponds to @xmath ), where the temperature of disk
is @xmath . This is expected of an object that is actively accreting
with such a high rate of @xmath , and is consistent with estimates by
Zhu07 ; Zhu08 where the disk temperature peaks at around @xmath . Such a
high temperature would be unexpected and perhaps unfeasible in a
standard protoplanetary disk, as standard silicate or graphite based
dust grain species will sublimate at such high temperatures. However,
this is not unexpected in FU Ori objects where the disk extends down to
the stellar photosphere, indeed one of the first works deriving
temperatures of FU Ori by Kenyon88 finds a maximum disk temperature of
@xmath based on SED and spectral line fitting, significantly hotter than
this work. The existence of dust at such temperature is possible through
highly refractive grain species such as Mg and Ti which are known to be
present Kenyon88 . In addition, strong gas emission could appear as
continuum emission for such low resolution observations. This highlights
how these objects cannot be thought of as simple star-disk systems, but
as one continuous object. The derived maximum temperature of the disk is
comparable to estimates of the efefctive temperature of FU Ori N of
@xmath ( Kenyon87 ; Zhu07 ; Zhu08 ) .

The inner disk radius is equivalent to that of the star indicating
boundary layer accretion directly from the disk onto the central star.
Beyond the inner radius, the temperature falls off with the power-law
@xmath to an outer radius cut-off at @xmath . The determined power-law
index is consistent with the predicted temperature profile for a steady
state, optically-thick accretion disk ( Pringle81 ) . A temperature
gradient of this profile is only possible if viscous heating processes
are present in the inner disk. Heating of flared disks by reprocessed
stellar radiation alone is shown to produce temperature exponents of
@xmath ( Kenyon87 ; Dullemond04 ) . Only through viscous heating can the
observed temperature profile be replicated.

The derived inner disk temperature gradient is in agreement with MIR
work conducted with the MIDI instrument by Quanz06 , who also found a
value of @xmath for the inner disk, although it is unclear whether their
estimate was constrained mainly by interferometry or SED data. This
contrasts with the outer ( @xmath au) disk model they derive, which is
also adopted here. In order to successfully fit the long wavelength SED
and N-band MIDI interferometry, a temperature gradient of @xmath is
adopted, in good agreement to what can be found for vertically
isothermal flared disks ( Kenyon87 ) . In order to test this result,
more comprehensive MIR N-band observations with the MATISSE instrument
MATISSE14 at VLTI are required.

It has been proposed that FUor stars may be newborn binaries that have
become bound when a small non-hierarchical multiple system breaks up (
Bonnell92 ) . In such a scenario Reipurth04 predict a close companion (
@xmath au). Accordingly, for the FU Ori systems, such models would
predict a third component orbiting FU Ori N in the inner 20 mas.
Malbet98 found tentative evidence for a companion located at @xmath au (
@xmath mas), however their data can be equally well interpreted as a
circumstellar disk, which was confirmed in later work. No other studies
have previously detected a companion in the inner few astronomical units
around FU Ori N. I conducted a companion search based on the MIRC-X
H-band visibilities and closure phases, I derive an upper limit to the
flux contrast of 1.3%, which corresponds to a maximum companion mass of
0.12 @xmath in the separation range between 0.5 and 50.0 mas. Therefore,
the observations do not support this scenario.

### 8.5 Conclusions

This multi-wavelength study has probed the inner disk geometry of FU Ori
at the highest angular resolution yet. Furthermore, I put for the first
time tight constraints on the disk temperature structure in the inner
astronomical unit.

I summarise my conclusions as follows:

-   I believe this first-of-its-kind study demonstrates a powerful and
    exciting new technique in the study of accretion and circumstellar
    disks. This allows us to directly test long-posited theoretical work
    with observational evidence and provide clues to the true nature of
    accretion and viscosity processes.

-   Temperature gradient models find an inner disk that extends down to
    the stellar photosphere at @xmath where the temperature reaches
    @xmath . This is in agreement with a heavily accreting star such as
    outbursting FUors and indicates boundary layer accretion processes.

-   The temperature of the inner disk falls off with a power-law @xmath
    . This is consistent with theoretical work for steady state,
    optically-thick accretion disks. Such a temperature profile is only
    possible if viscous heating processes are present in the inner disk.

-   The inclination and position angle of the disk are tightly
    constrained, providing a significant improvement over literature
    values. An inclination of @xmath and a minor axis position angle of
    @xmath are found from geometric modelling of the on sky brightness
    distrubution.

-   The minor axis position angle is around @xmath mis-aligned with the
    detection of a jet/outflow detected in scattered light images,
    assuming that the jet is perpendicular to the disk.

-   No significant companion is detected within the field of view of
    @xmath to @xmath mas. I place an upper limit of @xmath of the total
    @xmath -band flux on an potential companion in this separation
    range.

This study demonstrates the potential of combined J and H-band
interferometry to constrain the temperature structure on milliarcsecond
scales. This technique enables exciting new studies on a broad range of
science applications, from characterising the disks around young stellar
objects to stellar surface imaging.

## Chapter 9 Conclusions and Future Work

  “The mystery of life isn’t a problem to solve, but a reality to
  experience.”

  — Frank Herbert, Dune spacing

The aim of my PhD was to explore the innermost astronomical unit of
protoplanetary disks with optical interferometry in order to search for
evidence of planet formation processes. Although no direct evidence of
ongoing planet formation was discovered, each of the studies presented
in this thesis unveil new and exciting characteristics of protoplanetary
disks which have potentially significant impacts for planet formation
theory. In addition, the technical work undertaken opens up a new
frontier in optical interferometry, which will significantly impact our
understanding. In this concluding chapter, I shall summarise the key
results from this thesis and their impacts in addition to discussing the
principal skills and experience gained along the way. Finally, I shall
touch on the future work planned to build upon the techniques and
results of this work.

### 9.1 Conclusions

A key aspect of my PhD has been my involvement in the engineering and
instrumentation work with the CHARA array and MIRC-X instrument.
Firstly, my development of the CHARA baseline solution (Section 5.2),
has led to increasingly productive and efficient routine observing for
users of all beam combiners. Searching with delay lines for fringes
previously required scanning over @xmath taking up precious time. Since
this development and subsequent updates the required scan is reduced to
@xmath saving time and making observation of faint/low contrast objects
significantly easier. The other aspect of instrumentation work concerns
the expansion of the operating wavelength of MIRC-X to include the J
band ( @xmath ) (Section 5.1). This involved the modelling and
correcting for both atmospheric dispersion and internal instrument
birefringence using wedges of glass. I successfully obtained the first
science observations in the new dual JH-band observing mode in November
2019, highlighting the immense possibilities of the J band. It will
allow access to the photosphere in giant and super-giant stars
relatively free from opacities of molecular bands which are not
associated. In addition, the J band traces the warmest and smallest
scales of protoplanetary disks, where accretion and viscosity processes
are strongest and hence detectable. Finally, the J band allows for
higher resolution observations than near and mid-IR allowing us to probe
the smallest scales of astrophysical objects.

The first science conducted during my PhD was in regard to the young
star SU Aurigae, these are described in detail in chapters 6 & 7. In the
first of these studies, I interpreted interferometric data from a
variety of different instruments. Using this I was able to derive
significantly better constraints on the Gaussian-like geometry of the
system than previous studies. By investigating radiative transfer models
in the context of both visibilities and photometry I was able to explore
the shape of the dust sublimation rim. It was found that a classic gas
density dependent sublimation temperature which creates a curved rim was
insufficient to recreate the observed stellar-to-total flux ratio in the
interferometry or SED. In order to explain the dearth of flux in the
NIR, I invoked a dusty disk wind scenario where material is lifted out
of the disk along inclined magnetic field lines allowing for an
increased reprocessing of stellar radiation. Although the into-wind
transfer rate is potentially unphysically high, this scenario can
recreate the observables of SU Aur very well.

Follow-up observations of SU Aur were conducted with the MIRC-X
instrument, many of which were conducted by myself at the CHARA array
during several observing runs over several years. Such observing has
given great insight into the interferometric process and a deeper
understanding of the physics behind the observables. These new
observations provided increased resolution and more comprehensive
baseline coverage than my previous study. From this data I was able to
reconstruct a detailed image of the innermost region to reveal strong,
inclination induced, asymmetries where the far-side of the disk rim is
illuminated, while the near-side of the rim is obscured by its own
flaring. Interpretation of the geometry of SU Aurigae in the context of
SPHERE observations emphasises the discovery of a large warp between the
inner and outer disk of @xmath , creating large shadows on the outer
disk.

The first science observations in the new dual JH band mode were
conducted on the outbursting young star FU Orionis. FU Ori underwent a
massive, accretion fueled, outburst over 80 years ago and has remained
at a heightened luminosity ever since. This object, with a very hot disk
extending down to the stellar photosphere, was the ideal testbed for a
multi-wavelength observing campaign to explore the temperature gradient
across the inner disk. I discovered that the temperature gradient
exponent of @xmath was consistent with theoretical models of a viscously
heated disk in contrast to a disk heated by reprocessed stellar
radiation alone. The presence of viscous heating within the disk is a
major milestone as the presence and extent of such a process has been
much debated and relatively unconstrained by observations. It remains to
be seen is viscous heating is ubiquitous across FUors and the wider disk
population.

### 9.2 Future Work

In the author’s opinion, the most exciting work, with the greatest
potential in this thesis is the expansion of the MIRC-X wavelength range
and the subsequent multi-wavelength study of FU Orionis. It is for this
reason, I have chosen to continue this work in the form of a fellowship
at the European Southern Observatory (ESO). The temperature gradient of
FUors and the implications for viscous heating and accretion will be the
focus of the study. Over four years, I aim to conduct multi-wavelength
observations using both CHARA and VLTI on both FUor and non-FUor YSOs.
This will allow for studies of the temperature gradients across the
population of FUors and comparisons with non-outbursting stars. The key
questions will be approached:

-   How widespread are viscous heating processes in circumstellar
    environments? I will determine if viscous heating is common across
    the FUor object population and in Herbig Be disks.

-   How far through the disk does the actively accreting/viscously
    heated region extend? Is viscous heating only prevalent in the
    innermost regions, or does it extend further through the disk?

-   What would be the associated disk depletion times for steady-state
    and variable accretion scenarios? Conclusions can be drawn about the
    disk depletion and mass infall rate from the outer disk reservoir. A
    range of near and mid-IR wavelength observations will be crutial to
    answer such questions.

-   How do these timescales compare to the age and expected lifetime of
    the disk? Does the disk depletion timescale exceed or under-predict
    the expected disk lifetime?

-   What are the driving forces behind FUor accretion outbursts? Search
    for evidence of undetected companions and large asymmetric disk
    clumps.

Furthermore, these multi-wavelength interferometric observations will
allow me to investigate possible triggering mechanisms behind
outbursting events. Various competing models have been proposed
including gravitational instabilities and disk-companion interactions.
Both of these can be directly explored by searching for point source
companions or larger disk asymmetric clumps. In order build a complete
picture of the disks, I have a range of techniques in my arsenal of
expertise. Image reconstruction algorithms allows for model independent
analysis of disk structures. More complex disk models can be explored
using radiative transfer techniques, specifically using the TORUS code
with which I have much experience. This code also allows for coupling
with hydrodynamical disk simulations, which can explore the impact of
reservoirs or companions a disk over time and their potential for
causing accretion outbursts.
