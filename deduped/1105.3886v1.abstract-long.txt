Let @xmath be a smooth closed manifold and @xmath its cotangent bundle
endowed with the usual symplectic structure @xmath , where @xmath is the
Liouville form. A hypersurface @xmath is said to be fiberwise starshaped
if for each point @xmath the intersection @xmath of @xmath with the
fiber at @xmath is starshaped with respect to the origin @xmath .

In this thesis we give lower bounds of the growth rate of the number of
closed Reeb orbits on a fiberwise starshaped hypersurface in terms of
the topology of the free loop space of @xmath . We distinguish the two
cases that the fundamental group of the base space @xmath has an
exponential growth of conjugacy classes or not. If the base space @xmath
is simply connected we generalize the theorem of Ballmann and Ziller on
the growth of closed geodesics to Reeb flows.
