In this thesis we first apply the 1+3 covariant description of general
relativity to analyze n-fluid Friedmann-Lemaitre (FL) cosmologies; that is,
homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies whose matter-energy content consists of n
non-interacting fluids. We are motivated to study FL models of this type as
observations suggest the physical universe is closely described by a FL model
with a matter content consisting of radiation, dust and a cosmological
constant. Secondly, we use the 1+3 covariant description to analyse scalar,
vector and tensor perturbations of FL cosmologies containing a perfect fluid
and a cosmological constant. In particular, we provide a thorough discussion of
the behaviour of perturbations in the physically interesting cases of a dust or
radiation background.
