The thesis develops a systematic procedure to construct semi-classical
gravitational duals from quantum state manifolds. Though the systems
investigated are simple quantum mechanical systems without gauge symmetry many
familiar concepts from the conventional gauge/gravity duality come about in a
very natural way. The investigation of the low-dimensional manifolds link
existing results in the $AdS_2/CFT_1$ literature. We are able to extend these
in various ways and provide an explicit dictionary. The higher dimensional
investigation is also concluded with a simple dictionary, but this dictionary
requires the inclusion of many bulk coordinates. Consequently further work is
needed to relate these results to existing literature. Possible ways to achieve
this are discussed.
