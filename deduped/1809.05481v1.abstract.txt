We present algorithms for multi-modal route planning in road and public
transit networks, as well as in combined networks.
  Therefore, we explore the nearest neighbor and shortest path problem and
propose solutions based on Cover-Trees, ALT and CSA.
  Further, we illustrate the theory behind the algorithms, give a short
overview of other techniques, present experimental results and compare the
techniques with each other.
