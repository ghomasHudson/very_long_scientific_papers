Causal dynamical triangulations (CDT) constitute a background independent,
nonperturbative approach to quantum gravity, in which the gravitational path
integral is approximated by the weighted sum over causally well-behaving
simplicial manifolds i.e. causal triangulations. This thesis is an analysis of
the data from the Monte Carlo computer simulations of CDT in 3+1 dimensions. It
is confirmed here that there exist the semiclassical limit of CDT for so-called
(4,1) (or equivalent (1,4)) simplices, being a discrete version of the
mini-superspace model. Next, the form of the corresponding discrete action is
investigated. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the effective, semiclassical
solution works also after the inclusion of remaining (3,2) and (2,3) simplices,
treated collectively. A specific form of the resulting extended discrete action
is examined and a transition from the broader framework to the former narrower
one is shown.
