In this thesis, branching Brownian motion (BBM) is a random particle
system where the particles diffuse on the real line according to
Brownian motions and branch at constant rate into a random number of
particles with expectation greater than 1. We study two models of BBM
with selection: BBM with absorption at a space-time line and the @xmath
-BBM, where, as soon as the number of particles exceeds a given number
@xmath , only the @xmath right-most particles are kept, the others being
removed from the system. For the first model, we study the law of the
number of absorbed particles in the case where the process gets extinct
almost surely, using a relation between the
Fisher–Kolmogorov–Petrovskii–Piskounov (FKPP) and the Briot–Bouquet
equations. For the second model, the study of which represents the
biggest part of the thesis, we give a precise asymptotic on the position
of the cloud of particles when @xmath is large. More precisely, we show
that it converges at the timescale @xmath to a Lévy process plus a
linear drift, both of them explicit, which confirms a prediction by
Brunet, Derrida, Mueller and Munier. This study contributes to the
understanding of travelling waves of FKPP type under the influence of
noise. Finally, in a third part we point at the relation between the BBM
and stable point processes.
