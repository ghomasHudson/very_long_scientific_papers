We present the results of a search for new particles decaying to tau
pairs using the data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 195 pb
@xmath collected from March 2002 to September 2003 with the CDF detector
at the Tevatron. Hypothetical particles, such as @xmath and MSSM Higgs
bosons can potentially produce the tau pair final state. We discuss the
method of tau identification, and show the signal acceptance versus new
particle mass. The low-mass region, dominated by @xmath , is used as a
control region. In the high-mass region, we expect @xmath events from
known background sources, and observe @xmath events in the data sample.
Thus no significant excess is observed, and we set upper limits on the
cross section times branching ratio as a function of the masses of heavy
scalar and vector particles.
