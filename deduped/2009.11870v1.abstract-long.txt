We begin this thesis with an extensive pedagogical introduction aimed at
clarifying the foundations of the hierarchy problem. After introducing
effective field theory, we discuss renormalization at length from a
variety of perspectives. We focus on conceptual understanding and
connections between approaches, while providing a plethora of examples
for clarity. With that background we can then clearly understand the
hierarchy problem, which is reviewed primarily by introducing and
refuting common misconceptions thereof. We next discuss some of the
beautiful classic frameworks to approach the issue. However, we argue
that the LHC data have qualitatively modified the issue into ‘The
Loerarchy Problem’—how to generate an IR scale without accompanying
visible structure—and we discuss recent work on this approach. In the
second half, we present some of our own work in these directions,
beginning with explorations of how the Neutral Naturalness approach
motivates novel signatures of electroweak naturalness at a variety of
physics frontiers. Finally, we propose a New Trail for Naturalness and
suggest that the physical breakdown of EFT, which gravity demands, may
be responsible for the violation of our EFT expectations at the LHC.
