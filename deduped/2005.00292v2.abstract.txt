In the paradigm with a small warped Spacelike Extra Dimensions (SED), the
Higgs field is in general localized at a boundary of the SED (TeV-brane) where
the gravity scale is redshifted to the TeV by a warp factor. If the SM gauge
bosons and fermions propagate into the warped SED, one can generate the mass
hierarchy for fermions. It is thus crucial to treat carefully the TeV-brane
localized masses for such fermions, which is done in the literature by applying
a regularization process suffering from a lack of consistency and more
importantly being useless, as we demonstrate in detail in the present thesis.
The first part of the thesis is devoted to the treatment of brane localized
mass terms for 5D fermions, which requires the introduction of new Lagrangian
terms at the SED boundaries, similar to the Gibbons-Hawking terms in gravity.
The second part consists in applying different methods (function/distribution
fields, 4D/5D calculations, etc) to various brane localized terms (kinetic
terms, Majorana masses, etc), as well as a generalization to several classified
models (flat/warped dimensions, intervalle/orbifold, etc). In the third part,
we propose to compactify a flat SED on a star/rose graph with a large number of
identical small leaves/petals. We obtain a compactified space with a large
volume without a large compactification length to stabilize. We use the
approach of 5D fermions to build a toy model of small Dirac neutrino masses
(brane localized left-handed neutrinos and bulk right-handed ones).
