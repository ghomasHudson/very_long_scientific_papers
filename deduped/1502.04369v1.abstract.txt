In this master thesis we study multi-field inflation and the UV sensitivity
of certain models of inflation in supergravity. We first introduce inflation
and its current observational status. Then we provide an overview of studies of
multiple field inflation in the literature. We translate between the different
notations and definitions used in various papers and study the different
approximation schemes and their regime of validity. Finally we perform a
numerical study of models of multi-field inflation from recent papers in the
literature. We study if the current and future experiments might be able to
detect the presence of the additional fields in these models.
