This thesis initiates the study of cryptographic protocols in the
bounded-quantum-storage model. On the practical side, simple protocols for
Rabin Oblivious Transfer, 1-2 Oblivious Transfer and Bit Commitment are
presented. No quantum memory is required for honest players, whereas the
protocols can only be broken by an adversary controlling a large amount of
quantum memory. The protocols are efficient, non-interactive and can be
implemented with today's technology.
  On the theoretical side, new entropic uncertainty relations involving
min-entropy are established and used to prove the security of protocols
according to new strong security definitions. For instance, in the realistic
setting of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) against quantum-memory-bounded
eavesdroppers, the uncertainty relation allows to prove the security of QKD
protocols while tolerating considerably higher error rates compared to the
standard model with unbounded adversaries.
