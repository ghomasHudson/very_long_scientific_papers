### Introduction

##### Overview and motivation

Quantum integrable systems play an important role in the theoretical
physics. Many of these systems have direct physical applications. And
also, since we can solve them exactly, the integrable systems are often
considered as toy models and provide us with indispensable intuition for
investigation of more complicated theories.

A class of integrable systems can be solved by means of the Bethe
Ansatz. Bethe Ansatz was invented for the solution of the Heisenberg
magnet in a seminal work [ 1 ] in 1931. The solvability by means of the
Bethe Ansatz essentially relies on the two-dimensionality of the
considered system. Therefore the Bethe Ansatz works in the
two-dimensional statistical models and @xmath dimensional quantum field
theories. A two-dimensional integrable structure was also identified in
a way explained below in the four-dimensional gauge theory: @xmath
supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM). This theory became therefore the first
example of a non-trivial four dimensional quantum field theory where
some results were found exactly at arbitrary value of the coupling
constant.

@xmath SYM is also famous due to its conjectured equivalence [ 2 , 3 , 4
] to type IIB string theory on AdS @xmath S @xmath . This duality is the
first explicit and the most studied example of the gauge-string duality
known as the AdS/CFT correspondence. This duality is usually studied in
its weaker form, which states the equivalence between the ’t Hooft
planar limit of the gauge theory and the free string theory.

The AdS/CFT correspondence between gauge and string theories is the
duality of weak/strong coupling type. It allows giving an adequate
description of the strongly coupled gauge theory. On the other hand, the
weak/strong coupling nature of the duality conjecture makes difficult to
prove it. Except for the quantities protected by the symmetry and some
special limiting regimes, comparison of gauge and string theory
predictions requires essentially nonperturbative calculations. This is
where the integrability turns out to be extremely useful.

On the gauge side of the correspondence the integrability was initially
discovered in the 1-loop calculation of anomalous dimensions of single
trace local operators [ 5 ] . Later it was conjectured to hold at all
loops [ 6 ] . According to the integrability conjecture, the single
trace local operators correspond to the states of an integrable spin
chain in which the dilatation operator plays the role of a Hamiltonian.
At one-loop level this is a spin chain with the nearest neighbors’
interactions. It can be diagonalized for example by algebraic Bethe
Ansatz. The all-loop structure of the spin chain is much more
complicated. In particular, the all-loop Hamiltonian is not known.
Luckily, one of the beauties of the integrability is that it gives us a
way to find the spectrum of the system even without knowledge of the
exact form of the Hamiltonian. This solution can be obtained by
application of the method which was initially developed in [ 7 ] for the
two dimensional relativistic integrable theories. We will now briefly
recall this method.

Let us consider a two dimensional integrable relativistic quantum field
theory which has massive particles as asymptotic states. Due to the
existence of higher conserved charges, the number of particles is
preserved under scattering and the scattering factorizes into @xmath
processes. Therefore the dynamics of the system is determined by the
two-particle @xmath -matrix. This @xmath -matrix is determined up to an
overall scalar factor by the requirement of invariance under the
symmetry group and by the Yang-Baxter equation (self consistency of
two-particle factorization). The overall scalar factor is uniquely fixed
by the unitarity and crossing conditions and the assumption about the
particle content of the theory.

Let our field theory be defined on a cylinder of circumference @xmath .
The notion of asymptotic states and scattering can be defined only for
@xmath , where @xmath is the mass of the particles. If this condition is
satisfied, the system of @xmath particles is completely described by the
set of their momenta and additional quantum numbers. Once the quantum
numbers are chosen, the momenta of the particles can be found from the
periodicity conditions which lead to the Bethe equations. In the
simplest case when particles do not bear additional quantum numbers the
Bethe equations are written as:

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (1)
  -- -------- -- -----

The energy of the system can be found from the dispersion relation:

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (2)
  -- -------- -- -----

Therefore the knowledge of the scattering matrix solves the spectral
problem of the theory.

For simplicity we ignored the fact that the masses of the particles can
be in principle different.

It turns out that the AdS/CFT integrable spin chain can be also
described in terms of the factorized scattering. This idea was initially
proposed by Staudacher in [ 8 ] . In [ 9 ] Beisert showed that the
scattering matrix can be fixed up to an overall scalar factor, known
also as the dressing factor, already from the symmetry of the system.
The Yang-Baxter equation is then satisfied automatically. The dispersion
relation for the excitations is given by the expression

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (3)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath is the ’t Hooft coupling constant. This dispersion relation
was initially derived in [ 10 ] .

In [ 9 ] the Bethe Ansatz equations were derived from the knowledge of
@xmath -matrix using the nested Bethe Ansatz procedure. The equations
coincided with the ones conjectured in [ 11 ] . Note that the equations
are defined up to the dressing factor which cannot be fixed from the
symmetry.

Although the logic of derivation is similar to the one in the field
theory, in AdS/CFT we are dealing with the spin chain. This is seen in
particular in the dispersion relation which contains the sine function.
As in field theory, the resulting Bethe Ansatz is valid only in the
limit of large volume and is usually called the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz.

In spin chains the notion of the cross channel is not defined. Therefore
the formulation of the crossing equations is not obvious and this
prevents us from imposing constraints on the dressing factor. It seems
that knowledge that the spin chain describes the spectral problem of
@xmath SYM is insufficient to fix the dressing factor of the scattering
matrix. However, we can try using the fact that due to the duality
conjecture the AdS/CFT spin chain should solve also in some sense the
string theory. We therefore turn to the discussion of the string side of
the correspondence.

According to the duality conjecture, the conformal dimensions of local
operators are equivalent to the energies of string states. The free
string theory is described by the supersymmetric sigma model ¹ ¹ 1 with
properly taken into account Virasoro constraints and remaining gauge
freedom which come from the dynamical nature of the worldsheet metric in
string theory. [ 12 ] which is classically integrable [ 13 ] ² ² 2 The
integrable structures were discovered in the same time in gauge and
string theories. Developments of the integrability ideas on both sides
of the correspondence mutually used insights from each other . Assuming
its quantum integrability, we again can describe the system in terms of
the factorized scattering matrix and construct the corresponding Bethe
Ansatz from it. The AdS/CFT correspondence then implies that we will
obtain the same Bethe Ansatz equations as for the solution of spin
chain. In [ 14 ] Hofman and Maldacena proposed to identify special
one-particle excitations of the spin chain with special string
configurations known since then as giant magnons. The proposed
identification conformed also the dispersion relation ( 3 ). The
physical equivalence of scattering matrices for the sigma model and for
the spin chain was shown in [ 15 ] . Therefore we get an interesting
phenomenon: a discrete spin chain solves a continuous field theory.

Due to this phenomenon we can expect the existence of the crossing
equations for the scattering matrix of spin chain excitations. This is
not granted, since relativistic invariance of the system is broken by
the gauge fixing. In [ 16 ] Janik assumed that the crossing equations
are however present. He derived these equations by purely algebraic
means. We will explain his reasoning in details in subsection 6.3.1 of
this thesis.

The existence of a non-trivial dressing factor was established before
the crossing equations were formulated. The dressing factor was found at
the leading [ 17 ] and subleading [ 18 ] orders of strong coupling
expansion by comparison of the algebraic curve solutions [ 19 ] for the
sigma model and the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. At first three orders of
weak coupling expansion perturbative calculations of the gauge theory
showed that the dressing factor equals @xmath . If the duality
conjecture is true the dressing factor should interpolate between its
values at weak and strong coupling.

Beisert, Hernandez, and Lopez [ 20 ] checked that the results [ 17 , 18
] at strong coupling satisfy the crossing equations and proposed a class
of asymptotic solutions to the crossing equations to all orders of
perturbation theory. Based on this proposal and using a nontrivial
ressumation trick, Beisert, Eden, and Staudacher [ 21 ] conjectured a
convergent weak coupling expansion for the dressing factor and found the
nonperturbative expression that reproduced that expansion. Their
proposal is known now as the BES/BHL dressing factor. Based on this
conjecture they formulated the integral equation known as the BES
equation. This equation was the Eden-Staudacher equation [ 22 ] modified
because of the non-triviality of the dressing factor. The solution of
the BES equation allows one to find the cusp anomalous dimension - the
quantity that acquired attention both at gauge and string side of the
correspondence. The BES/BHL proposal passed a non-trivial check. The
cusp anomalous dimension calculated in [ 21 ] up to fourth order in the
weak coupling expansion from the BES equation coincided with the
four-loop perturbative calculations in @xmath SYM [ 23 ] .

The @xmath -matrix fixed by the symmetry and equipped with the BES/BHL
dressing factor defines the AdS/CFT integrable system. The anomalous
dimensions at arbitrary values of the coupling constant can be computed
using the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. Since integrability was not
rigorously proven, the validity of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz had to be
checked.

##### Personal contribution

The verification of the AdS/CFT Bethe Ansatz at strong coupling was the
subject which initiated my PhD research. This verification resulted in
the papers [ KSV1 , KSV2 , V1 ] . In the papers [ KSV1 , KSV2 ] we
analyzed the strong coupling expansion of the BES equation, the paper [
V1 ] was devoted to the strong coupling solution of the generalization
of the BES equation proposed in [ 24 , 25 ] . These problems proved to
be rather difficult. The solution of these equations was a subject of
interest of several theoretical groups [ 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 ] , [ 30 , 31
] , [ 32 , 33 ] , [ 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 ] . In our works we realized that
it was particularly useful to rewrite the integral equation in the form
of a specific Riemann-Hilbert problem. Such representation allowed
further significant simplifications of the equations and finally allowed
to solve them perturbatively.

The developed techniques turned out to be useful for the solution of
similar integral equations that appeared in different integrable models.
In [ V2 ] we applied this techniques to find the free energy of the
@xmath sigma model in the presence of magnetic field at first 26 orders
of the perturbative expansion. The solution at leading and subleading
orders allowed deriving analytically the exact value of mass gap, which
was guessed previously from numerics in [ 38 , 39 ] . Higher orders of
the perturbative expansion allowed testing the properties of Borel
summability of the model.

My fifth paper [ V3 ] gave another evidence for the correctness of the
AdS/CFT asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. The paper was devoted to the solution
of the crossing equation for the dressing factor. Despite many checks of
the BES/BHL proposal this dressing factor was never obtained directly
from the solution of the crossing equation. In [ V3 ] we presented such
kind of derivation. Moreover, we showed that the solution of the
crossing equations is unique if to impose quite natural requirements on
the analytical structure of the scattering matrix and to demand the
proper structure of singularities that correspond to the physical bound
states in the theory.

This thesis contains most of the results of the mentioned works [ KSV1 ,
KSV2 , V1 , V2 , V3 ] . The references to these works are listed at the
end of the introductory chapter. However, as we will now explain, the
discussed topics in the thesis are not enclosed with explanation of [
KSV1 , KSV2 , V1 , V2 , V3 ] .

##### About functional equations

While we considered particular problems in the context of the AdS/CFT
correspondence, it became clear that formulation following from the
Bethe Ansatz integral equations in the functional form reveals
resemblance between the AdS/CFT integrable system and rational
integrable systems. Therefore we put a lot of attention in this thesis
to reviewing of the simplest rational integrable models, such as XXX
spin chain and Gross-Neveu and principal chiral field sigma models.
Instead of using more usual language of integral equations or Fourier
transform we perform the review in terms of the functional equations.
Then we are able to present the AdS/CFT case as a generalization of
rational integrable systems. Basically AdS/CFT spin chain requires for
its formulation only one additional integral kernel @xmath with simple
analytical properties.

In the first part of this thesis we also devote attention to such topics
as Hirota relations and thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA). Also these
subjects are not directly used by us in the AdS/CFT case, there are
number of reasons to include them in the current work. First of all, TBA
has a remarkable algebraic structure based on two deformed Cartan
matrices. This algebraic structure is seen also on the level of (linear)
functional equations. Second, the structure of the supersymmetric Bethe
Ansatz is much better seen if Hirota relations are used for its
derivation [ 40 ] . Third, the discussion of TBA in the rational case
can be thought as a preparation for the subject of TBA in the AdS/CFT
correspondence which has been recently studied in the literature [ 41 ,
42 , 43 ] , [ 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 ] .

The name ”functional equations” is mostly used in this thesis to denote
the functional equations that were used for the asymptotic solution of
integral Bethe Ansatz equations. These functional equations are linear.
This thesis deals also with two nonlinear functional equations. The
first type is the Hirota equations. Since Hirota equations coincide with
the TBA equations, the algebraic structure of Hirota equations can be
also seen from the algebraic structure of linear functional equations.
The second type is the crossing equations.

##### Original results presented in this thesis

This thesis contains few minor original results that were not published
before.

In chapter 7 we present the solution of the @xmath Heisenberg magnet in
the logarithmic regime and at large values of @xmath . This solution is
based on the techniques developed in [ KSV2 , V1 , V2 ] . The solution
gives a check of the two-loop strong coupling expansion of the
generalized scaling function performed in [ 48 ] , [ V1 ] .

In Sec. 3.5 we show for the case of the @xmath Gross-Neveu model and
equally polarized excitations that the transfer matrices of the spin
chain discretization become in the thermodynamic limit the @xmath
-functions which appear in the TBA system.

In Sec. 4.5 we show that the integral equations for the densities of
string configurations in the @xmath case fit the fat hook structure ³ ³
3 We were informed that this result was also obtained by V.Kazakov,
A.Kozak, and P.Vieira, however it has not been published. . This is
generalization of the known results for the @xmath and the @xmath cases.

In Sec. 8.3 we give an alternative to [ 34 ] derivation of the @xmath
sigma model from the BES/FRS equation. This an important check of the
AdS/CFT integrable system originally proposed in [ 49 ] and explicitly
realized in [ 34 ] .

In appendix C we solve the mirror crossing equations in a similar way as
the physical crossing equations were solved in [ V3 ] . This allows
deriving the mirror integrable theory based only on the symmetries of
the system, without performing analytical continuation from the physical
theory.

##### Structure of the thesis

The text of the thesis is divided into three parts. The parts were
designed in a way that the reader familiar with basic aspects of
integrability could read each part separately. Therefore some concepts
are repeated throughout the text.

###### Part 1. Integrable systems with rational R-matrix.

The main goal of this part is to give a pedagogical introduction to the
subject of integrability.

In the first chapter we introduce the Bethe Ansatz for the integrable
XXX spin chain. The XXX spin chain can be easily formulated and the
Bethe Ansatz solution is the exact one. This Bethe Ansatz is also
important since it describes the AdS/CFT integrable system at one-loop
approximation on the gauge side.

In the second chapter we discuss the Bethe Ansatz solution of IQFT on
the example of the principal chiral field (PCF) and the Gross-Neveu (GN)
models. We exploit the constructions developed in the first chapter
since the @xmath -matrix in such models up to a scalar factor coincides
with the @xmath -matrix of the XXX spin chain.

The third chapter aims to show that the PCF and GN models can be viewed
as a certain thermodynamic limit of the XXX spin chain. The derivation
is based on the string hypothesis. We show also that the functional
structure of the Y-system is basically dictated by the functional
structure of the equations for the resolvents of string configurations.

The fourth chapter is devoted to the supersymmetric generalization of
the ideas developed in the previous chapters.

###### Part 2. Integrable system of AdS/CFT.

This part is devoted for reviewing of the integrability in AdS/CFT.

In the fifth chapter we make a general overview of the AdS/CFT
correspondence, explain how the integrable system appeared in the
spectral problem and discuss the main examples of the local
operators/string states which were investigated in the literature.

In the sixth chapter we explain the main steps for the construction of
the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. The second part of this chapter is devoted
to the solution of the crossing equations which is based on the author’s
work [ V3 ] .

###### Part 3. Integral Bethe Ansatz equations.

This part is based on the original works [ KSV1 , KSV2 , V1 , V2 ] . It
is devoted to the perturbative solution of a certain class of integral
Bethe Ansatz equations. The method of the solution is basically the same
for all three cases that are considered (one chapter for one case). This
part is provided with its own introduction.

## Part I Integrable systems with rational R-matrix

### Chapter 1 @xmath XXX spin chains

#### 1.1 Coordinate Bethe Ansatz

The Bethe Ansatz is one of the most important tools for the solution of
the quantum integrable models. It is applicable to all the integrable
models considered in this thesis. In the first part of the thesis we
would try to give a pedagogical review of the Bethe Ansatz and related
topics with the perspective to the modern applications. For other
pedagogical texts see [ 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 ] .

The Bethe Ansatz was initially proposed in [ 1 ] for the solution of the
@xmath XXX spin chain which served as an approximation for the
description of the one-dimensional metal. We will study a slightly more
general @xmath case. The @xmath XXX spin chain is defined as follows. To
each node of the chain we associate the integer number with possible
values from @xmath to @xmath . In other words, each node carries a state
in the fundamental representation of @xmath . The Hamiltonian is given
by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the operator that permutes the @xmath states at sites
@xmath and @xmath .

The problem of the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian can be solved by
the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. To show how it works, we should choose a
pseudovacuum of the system. A possible choice is @xmath (the number zero
is assigned to all the nodes). This is indeed a state with the lowest
energy, although this energy level is highly degenerated due to the
@xmath symmetry of the system. For the opposite sign of the Hamiltonian
(antiferromagnetic spin chain) this state is no longer the vacuum but
just a suitable state for the construction of the coordinate Bethe
Ansatz.

We consider subsequently the one-, two-, three- e.t.c particle
excitations. By @xmath -particle excitation we mean a state in which the
values of exactly @xmath nodes are different from @xmath .

From the one-particle excitations we can compose a plane wave excitation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

This plane wave is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian with the
eigenvalue

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

For the investigation of the two-particle excitations let us first
consider the following state:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.4)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The Hamiltonian does not act diagonally on it. However, its action can
be represented in the following form:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (1.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

It is straightforward to check that the terms @xmath cancel out if we
consider the following linear combination

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

with

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The matrix @xmath is called the scattering matrix. Note that indices
@xmath and @xmath take values from @xmath to @xmath . This is because
the pseudovacuum is not invariant under the @xmath symmetry but only
under the @xmath subgroup, therefore the excitations over the
pseudovacuum transform under @xmath .

It is useful to introduce the rapidity variable @xmath via the relation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

In terms of the rapidity variables the @xmath matrix has a simpler form:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here the operator @xmath permutes the @xmath states of the particles. It
is different from @xmath in ( 1.1 ) where @xmath states were permuted.

For a sufficiently long spin chain we can give a physical interpretation
for ( 1.6 ) as the scattering process. Let us take @xmath . The function
@xmath is interpreted as the initial state: the particle with momenta
@xmath is on the left side from the particle @xmath . The function
@xmath represents the out state. Scattering of the particles leads to
the exchange of their flavors and to the appearance of the relative
phase. The scattering is encoded in the @xmath matrix. The permutation
operator @xmath in ( 1.9 ) exchanges the flavors of the particles ¹ ¹ 1
We chose the notation in which the flavor is attached to the momenta of
the particle. The other notation is also possible in which the flavor is
attached to the relative position of the particle. In the latter
notation the @xmath matrix differs by multiplication on the permutation
operator. .

The two particle wave function ( 1.6 ) can be written in a condensed
notation as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

It turns out that for the three-particle case the following linear
combination

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian with the eigenvalue @xmath . It
can be interpreted as the combination of all possible configurations
obtained from the pairwise scattering of initial configuration given by
@xmath . The property that we encounter only the @xmath scattering
process is an essential property of the integrability.

The last term in @xmath can be written also as @xmath . This is because
the process @xmath can be obtained in two different ways. The
independence of the order of individual scattering processes is encoded
in the Yang-Baxter equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is straightforward to check that this equation is satisfied by the
@xmath matrix ( 1.9 ). The scattering matrix also satisfies the
unitarity condition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us consider now the states with larger number of particles. The
solution of the diagonalization problem is obtained in a similar way.
This solution is known as the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. The @xmath
-particle wave function is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the sum is taken over all permutations. The symbol @xmath means
the following. We choose a realization of @xmath in terms of a product
of the elementary permutations: @xmath . The transpositions of only the
neighboring particles are allowed. Then @xmath . The construction of the
wave function is unambiguous since the @xmath matrix satisfies the
Yang-Baxter equation ( 1.12 ) and the unitarity condition ( 1.13 ).

The Ansatz ( 1.14 ) gives the solution of the diagonalization problem
for the case of the spin chain on infinite line. For the case of the
periodic spin chain of length @xmath there are constraints on the
possible values of momenta. To write down these constraints we first
need to introduce an appropriate basis in the space of functions ( 1.14
).

The scattering matrix is invariant under action of the @xmath group.
Therefore, instead @xmath where @xmath is the projector to a chosen
representation @xmath of the @xmath group. As we will show in the next
section, it is possible to decompose the whole representation space
@xmath in a sum of irreps

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

The ordering in the product is taken in such a way that @xmath is to the
right from @xmath if @xmath mod @xmath .

For @xmath the decomposition ( 1.15 ) is a trivial property since the
scattering matrix commutes with the symmetry generators. The nontrivial
statement for @xmath is in simultaneous validity of ( 1.16 ) for
different values of @xmath .

We chose a basis in such a way that each basis wave function lies inside
some irrep @xmath . The periodicity condition, which can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

implies the following equations on @xmath , @xmath , for a chosen irrep
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

Once momenta satisfy ( 1.18 ), @xmath is the eigenfunction of the
Hamiltonian on the periodic chain of length @xmath with the energy

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that if the set of momenta @xmath is a solution of ( 1.18 ) for a
given representation @xmath , there is no guaranty that the same set of
momenta would be a solution for a different representation. In fact, the
general situation is that a set of momenta is a solution of ( 1.18 ) for
only one representation @xmath .

The equations ( 1.18 ) are best written in terms of the nested transfer
matrix ² ² 2 We use the adjective ”nested” to distinguish ( 1.20 ) with
what is usually called the transfer matrix and which we introduce later.
which is defined as follows. We introduce an auxiliary particle @xmath ,
with rapidity @xmath , in the fundamental representation of the @xmath
group. The nested transfer matrix is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the trace is token over the representation space of the auxiliary
particle. Since @xmath , the periodicity conditions ( 1.18 ) can be
written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the case @xmath the @xmath matrix is just a scalar function and the
equations ( 1.21 ) reduce to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

which are the Bethe Ansatz equations for the @xmath XXX spin chain.

Let us now briefly describe how the solutions of the Bethe equations (
1.22 ) are mapped to the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian ( 1.1 ) for the
case @xmath .

The solutions with at least two coinciding rapidities lead to a zero
wave function. This is due to the fact that @xmath . Each solution with
pairwise different rapidities, @xmath , and finite values of @xmath
leads to an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian ³ ³ 3 There are few solutions
of exceptional type of the Bethe equations, which require the proper
regularization to fit this picture. The example is the solution @xmath
for @xmath and @xmath . . This eigenstate is a highest weight vector in
the irreducible multiplet of @xmath . To obtain the other states of this
multiplet we have to add subsequently the particles with infinite
rapidities (zero momenta) to the solution. Adding the particle with
infinite rapidity is equivalent to the action of the lowering generator
of the @xmath algebra on the wave function. The Bethe Ansatz solution is
complete [ 56 ] . This means that all the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian
can be obtained by the procedure that we described.

#### 1.2 Nested/Algebraic Bethe Ansatz

For @xmath we have to diagonalize the nested transfer matrix (perform
the decomposition ( 1.15 )) in order to solve the periodicity conditions
( 1.21 ). This is the subject of the nested Bethe Ansatz. We consider
first the case of the @xmath spin chain.

In this case the excitations over the pseudovacuum can have only two
labels, @xmath and @xmath .

It is instructive to use the graphical representation (see Fig. 1.1 )
for the algebraic constructions that we will use. In the graphical
representation each particle is represented by an arrow. For each arrow
we assign the rapidity and the color. If the direction is not shown
explicitly we take by default that the particle propagates 1)from left
to right and 2)from bottom to top. @xmath matrix is given as an
intersection of two lines (scattering of the particles).

The graphical representation of the nested monodromy matrix @xmath and
the nested transfer matrix @xmath defined by ( 1.20 ) are shown in
Fig. ( 1.2 ).

The nested monodromy matrix @xmath scatters the auxiliary particle
through all the physical particles. Since in the considered case (
@xmath ) particles can be in one of two states ( @xmath or @xmath ), we
can write the nested monodromy matrix as a two by two matrix with
elements acting on the physical space only:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

Obviously, @xmath .

The nested transfer matrices with different values of @xmath commute
with one another:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

Indeed, from the Yang-Baxter equation the following equation follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
              @xmath               
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.25)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

It can be also rewritten as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

Taking the trace over the representation spaces of both auxiliary
particles in ( 1.26 ) we prove the commutativity of the nested transfer
matrices.

Due to the commutativity of the nested transfer matrices the
simultaneous diagonalization of @xmath is possible. Since @xmath is
invariant under the symmetry algebra, the condition ( 1.16 ) can be also
satisfied and the Bethe Ansatz equations ( 1.21 ) can be constructed.

To solve the problem of diagonalization of @xmath we first introduce a
nested pseudovacuum. It consists of the particles with rapidities @xmath
, all of them are of the color @xmath . We will denote this new
pseudovacuum as @xmath .

The nested transfer matrix acts diagonally on @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we introduced the Baxter polynomial

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

Excitations over the nested pseudovacuum are generated by @xmath
operators:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

These states are given by the diagram in Fig. 1.3 .

Generically, the action of the nested transfer matrix on the state
@xmath is not diagonal. However this is the case if the rapidities
@xmath satisfy the relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

The eigenvalue of the transfer matrix is then given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here we do not prove that the condition ( 1.30 ) is necessary and
sufficient to diagonalize action of @xmath . See for example [ 51 ] .
However note that the relation ( 1.30 ) can be read from the eigenvalue
of the transfer matrix in the following way. From the form of the @xmath
matrix we see that the nested transfer matrix cannot have poles at
@xmath . The application of this demand to ( 1.31 ) gives us ( 1.30 ).

If we shift the variables @xmath by @xmath , the equation ( 1.30 )
acquires the form of the nested Bethe Ansatz equation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

The periodicity condition ( 1.21 ) leads to the following Bethe
equation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

From solution of ( 1.33 ) and ( 1.32 ) we can construct the eigenstate
for the @xmath XXX spin chain using ( 1.29 ) and ( 1.14 ) and find its
energy using ( 1.19 ).

###### Algebraic Bethe Ansatz for the @xmath XXX spin chain

We can make another interpretation for the relations ( 1.30 ). If to put
all the @xmath equal to @xmath , then ( 1.30 ) transforms to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is nothing but the Bethe Ansatz ( 1.22 ) for the Heisenberg @xmath
XXX spin chain with @xmath replaced by @xmath .

Of course, when all @xmath are equal, we cannot interpret them as
rapidities of excitations in the spin chain - the wave function would be
just zero for them. Correspondingly, the periodicity condition ( 1.18 )
looses its sense. Instead, each particle with rapidity @xmath is
interpreted as a node in the spin chain. Diagonalization of @xmath
automatically diagonalize the Hamiltonian due to the following equality:

  -- -- -- --------
           (1.35)
  -- -- -- --------

The nested eigenvectors ( 1.29 ) are proportional to the corresponding
states ( 1.14 ) of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz.

This approach of solving the XXX spin chain is called the algebraic
Bethe Ansatz [ 57 , 58 ] . The matrix @xmath in the algebraic Bethe
Ansatz approach is called the transfer matrix of a spin chain. This
explains why in previous section we used the notion of the ”nested”
transfer matrix: to distinguish between nested and algebraic Bethe
Ansatz interpretations.

Together with the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian the algebraic Bethe
Ansatz gives us the possibility to construct higher conserved charges.
The local conserved charges are the coefficients of the expansion of the
transfer matrix around a singular point @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here @xmath is the operator of translation by one node of a spin chain.

Expansion around any other nonsingular point gives us other conserved
charges that are not local. Of course the distinction between locality
and no locality can be made only in the limit of infinite length.

###### Nested Bethe Ansatz for @xmath

The construction that we used to diagonalize @xmath can be generalized
to the case with arbitrary @xmath [ 59 ] .

For example for @xmath any excited state can be built by the procedure
shown in Fig. 1.4 ⁴ ⁴ 4 We conjecture that Fig. 1.4 is equivalent to the
procedure in [ 59 ] . Although we did not prove this explicitly, we
checked on simple examples that the procedure in Fig. 1.4 generates
eigenstates of the transfer matrix once the rapidities satisfy nested
Bethe Ansatz equations. .

Again, the nested transfer matrix acts diagonally if and only if the
rapidities @xmath , @xmath and @xmath satisfy relations which are
exactly the nested Bethe Ansatz equations. The shortcut to write these
relations can be read from the fact that the eigenvalue of the transfer
matrix on the nested state is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the requirement that the transfer matrix does not have poles except
for @xmath .

The nested Bethe Ansatz equations can be encoded in the following
diagram:

Each node of the diagram corresponds to the one type of nested Bethe
roots. For each node its left neighbor plays the role of the
inhomogeneous spin chain. The cross corresponds to the initial
homogeneous spin chain (each node of which can be interpreted as a
particle with rapidity equal to @xmath ).

Actually, the diagram 1.5 without cross is nothing but the Dynkin
diagram. The cross corresponds to the fact that we consider particles in
the fundamental representation of the @xmath group defined by the Dynkin
labels @xmath .

Each physically meaningful solution of the Bethe equations should not
contain coinciding rapidities. The solutions with only finite Bethe
roots and the numbers of Bethe roots that satisfy inequalities ( 1.44 )
give the highest weight vectors in the irreducible multiplet of the
@xmath group. The highest weight states and the states obtained from
them by action of the symmetry generators span the whole Hilbert space
of the system [ 60 ] .

If to put @xmath , we can interpret Fig. 1.4 as the algebraic Bethe
Ansatz for the @xmath spin chain. In this case the procedure shown in
Fig. 1.4 gives us also the wave function of the corresponding
eigenstate.

It is also possible to construct the Bethe Ansatz for arbitrary simple
Lie algebra and arbitrary irreducible representation (irrep). For a Lie
algebra of rank @xmath defined by the Cartan matrix @xmath and for the
irrep given by the Dynkin labels @xmath the Bethe Ansatz equations for a
homogeneous spin chain of length @xmath are written as [ 61 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 1.3 Counting of Bethe roots and string hypothesis

For the simplest case of the @xmath magnet the number of the Bethe roots
cannot be larger than the half of the length of the spin chain. This
restriction can be explained by the representation theory. Each solution
of the Bethe equations with all Bethe roots being finite corresponds to
a highest weight vector. We cannot construct the highest weight vector
for the number of excitations larger than the half of the length.

The same logic may be applied in principle for the @xmath magnet.
However, it would be nice to see how the constraints on the number of
the Bethe roots come directly from the Bethe equations. We will first do
this derivation for the @xmath case and then generalize to arbitrary
@xmath .

It is useful to introduce the Baxter equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

Assuming that @xmath is a polynomial, it is easy to see that the set of
the Bethe equations in the @xmath case ( 1.22 ) is equivalent to the
demand that the function @xmath defined by ( 1.39 ) is an entire
function (and therefore is a polynomial).

The zeroes of @xmath are the Bethe roots, therefore @xmath is the Baxter
polynomial ( 1.28 ). The reader can recognize in @xmath the eigenvalue
of the transfer matrix rescaled by an overall factor ( cf. ( 1.31 )).

Let us take a solution of the Bethe equations which consists only from
real roots and find all zeroes of the l.h.s. of ( 1.39 ). Among these
zeroes there are Bethe roots (zeroes of @xmath ) and zeroes of @xmath .
The real zeroes of @xmath we will call holes. The zeroes of @xmath with
nonzero imaginary part will be called accompanying roots.

Accompanying roots are situated roughly on the distance @xmath above and
below the Bethe roots. This fact can be understood in the large @xmath
limit. Indeed, if we consider the region @xmath for the large @xmath ,
generically the second term in the l.h.s. of ( 1.39 ) is suppressed with
respect to the first one. To estimate the magnitude of the suppression
one can approximate

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

We see that suppression is strong at large @xmath if @xmath is
sufficiently close to origin.

The first term in the l.h.s. of ( 1.39 ) is suppressed for @xmath .
Therefore in the large @xmath limit we can write approximately

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.41)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

We see that the accompanying roots are given in the first approximation
by zeroes of @xmath and @xmath . Therefore each Baxter root gives 2
accompanying zeroes in @xmath . Counting the number of zeroes on both
sides of the Baxter equation, we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the number of Bethe roots and @xmath is the number of
holes.

The maximally filled state does not contain holes and we obtain the
known restriction on the number of the Bethe roots.

This analysis is simply generalized to the case of @xmath magnet. In
this case we have @xmath types of Bethe roots. Let us denote the number
of roots of each type by @xmath . For the @xmath -th type of the Bethe
roots we can write the Baxter equation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now the @xmath play the same role as @xmath in ( 1.39 ) and we obtain
@xmath .

The complete set of inequalities can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

From here it follows that a maximally saturated state (antiferromagnetic
vacuum), which corresponds to the trivial representation, is constructed
from the following number of Bethe roots:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### String hypothesis

The accompanying roots could not be the roots of @xmath since we had
restricted ourselves for the case when all the Bethe roots are real. If
we allow the Bethe roots to be complex, then an accompanying root can
become the complex root of @xmath . But in this case this complex root
of @xmath will have its own accompanying root. In turn, we can allow
this second-level accompanying root to enter the Baxter polynomial or
not. In such a way we construct a so called string.

The string of length @xmath , or @xmath -string, is the following set of
the Bethe roots:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

where, depending on @xmath , @xmath is integer or half-integer. The
@xmath -string is completely defined by the position of its center
@xmath .

The string hypothesis states that in the limit @xmath all the Bethe
roots are organized in strings. It was shown by counterexamples that the
string hypothesis is strictly speaking wrong. Although, as we can see
from ( 1.40 ), stringy configurations dominate for @xmath being close to
the origin, for @xmath the configuration resembles string only
qualitatively. In this regime the imaginary distance between roots
scales as @xmath and the positions of roots belonging to string
significantly deviate from lying on a straight line. There are also more
sophisticated examples of solutions which do not satisfy string
hypothesis even qualitatively ⁵ ⁵ 5 For numerical and analytical studies
related to the string hypothesis see [ 62 , 63 , 64 , 65 ] and
references therein. .

Although the string hypothesis is wrong, the stringy configurations
describe the low energy excitations in some regimes that we will be
interested in. Therefore it is reasonable to study Bethe equations as if
the string hypothesis was correct.

What is a string from the point of view of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz?
Let us consider a string of length two which is composed from two
rapidities @xmath . The wave function for such string is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (1.47)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Since @xmath , this wave function describes the propagation of the bound
state with momenta @xmath . Therefore strings correspond to the bound
states.

###### Interaction of strings

Each nested level of the @xmath Bethe Ansatz has its own string
solutions. Let us assume that the string hypothesis is valid and write
down Bethe equations explicitly for the center of strings.

The Bethe equations are constructed from the following building block:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

The indices @xmath label the nested level of the Bethe roots (the case
@xmath is considered below), @xmath enumerate Bethe roots at each level.

Let us introduce the shift operator

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the following notation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this notation the function @xmath will be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

To write the Bethe equation for the center of a given string we have to
multiply the Bethe equations for each root which constitutes the string.
For the string of length @xmath and with the center at @xmath we will
get the get a factor of the type

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

From ( 1.48 ) we conclude that the interaction of the strings of length
@xmath and @xmath with centers at @xmath and @xmath are written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

We have to understand the denominator of @xmath as such power series
that @xmath represents a finite linear combination of shift operators.
More precisely:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (1.54)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The expression ( 1.53 ) describes the interaction of strings from
different nested levels ( @xmath ). In the case when strings belong to
the same nested level, the interaction will look like

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now we are ready to write down the set of Bethe equations for the
centers of strings. We introduce the following notations.

First, the centers of strings are marked by @xmath , where @xmath labels
the nested level (node of the Dynkin diagram), @xmath labels the length
of the string and @xmath enumerates different strings with the same
@xmath .

Then we will also need the ” @xmath -deformed” Cartan matrix of the
Dynkin diagram:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the adjacency matrix of the Dynkin diagram. For @xmath
series which we consider @xmath . For example, for @xmath the deformed
Cartan matrix is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using these notations, the Bethe equations for centers of strings that
follow from ( 1.38 ) can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 1.4 Fusion procedure and Hirota equations

The Bethe Ansatz equations can be also derived by the procedure
different from the one presented above. This procedure includes
derivation of the functional (Hirota) equations ( 1.80 ) and then
solution of them via the chain of Backlund transforms ( 1.85 ). This
procedure is interesting in particular because the functional equations
( 1.80 ) reflect the symmetry algebra of the system. The analytic
peculiarities of the system appear then by imposing proper boundary
conditions when solving ( 1.80 ). In principle, it is possible to choose
different boundary conditions and therefore obtain different integrable
systems based on the same symmetry group.

In this section we will explain the meaning of the functional equations
( 1.80 ). In the next section we will show how to solve them. We will
consider only the rational case which leads to the Bethe equations of
the XXX spin chain.

First, let us make a simplification. The @xmath matrix ( 1.9 ) can be
represented as the ratio of the @xmath -matrix

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the scalar factor @xmath . The @xmath -matrix satisfies the
Yang-Baxter equation. However, the unitarity condition is replaced by
@xmath .

In the following we will assign to the scattering of the particles the
@xmath -matrix ( 1.59 ) instead of the @xmath matrix ( 1.9 ). This is a
reasonable since the common scalar factors, like @xmath , do not play
the role in the problem of the diagonalization of the transfer matrix.
Due to this we will also define the transfer matrix through the @xmath
-matrices:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

Starting from now, we will also understand the transfer matrix in the
sense of its definition for the algebraic Bethe Ansatz procedure.

Until now we studied only scattering of the particles in the fundamental
representation. It turns out useful to introduce the particles in
different representations. We can introduce them by a so called fusion
procedure. Let us first understand how the fusion procedure works for
the construction of the particles in the symmetric and the antisymmetric
representations.

We define the particle in the symmetric/antisymmetric representation as
a composite of two fundamental particles with
symmetrization/antisymmetrization of the color:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the projectors @xmath are defined as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

This definition of the composite particle makes sense only if the
projection to the symmetric or antisymmetric representation survives
under scattering with other particles:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

This requirement is satisfied if to choose the relative rapidities of
the constituent fundamental particles as shown in ( 1.61 ). Indeed, let
us use the fact that the operator @xmath has the following property:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then the property ( 1.63 ), for example for the particle in the
symmetric representation, is a simple consequence of

  -- -- -- --------
           (1.65)
  -- -- -- --------

where we used the Yang-Baxter equation and the property that @xmath .

Let us take the particle in the symmetric representation with the color
@xmath ⁶ ⁶ 6 curly brackets means symmetrization and scatter it with the
particle in the fundamental representation which carries the color
@xmath . Direct calculation shows that the scattering process is the
following:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

We will drop the overall scalar factor @xmath . Then the @xmath -matrix
of this process is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath now means a generalized permutation: @xmath .

The particle in any representation given by the Young table with @xmath
boxes can be constructed as a composite particle of @xmath fundamental
particles with a corresponding symmetrization of color indices. The
relative rapidities of the fundamental particles are chosen such that
the symmetrization commutes with the scattering process. The scattering
of composite particles satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation since the
scattering of the fundamental particles does. The @xmath -matrix can be
calculated in the way analogous to the presented above calculation of
@xmath . For the explicit formulas and more detailed discussion see [ 66
] .

In the following we will be interested only in the rectangular
representations - the representations @xmath given by the rectangular
Young tables with @xmath rows and @xmath columns ⁷ ⁷ 7 @xmath for
antisymmetrization, @xmath for symmetrization . For the scattering of
the rectangular representation with the fundamental one the R-matrix has
a simple form ⁸ ⁸ 8 The @xmath -matrix for the scattering of two
arbitrary representations is in general complicated. It is given as a
polynomial over the generalized permutation operator with coefficients
that depend on @xmath . :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a generalized permutation operator.

The generalized permutation operator @xmath acting on the tensor product
of two arbitrary representations @xmath is defined as follows. The color
of the particle in the representation @xmath is given by @xmath , where
@xmath is a number of boxes in the Young table and @xmath is a
projector. The operator @xmath is a sum over all possible pairwise
permutations of the indices @xmath of @xmath with the indices @xmath of
@xmath . For example, the generalized permutation operator acts on the
tensor product of symmetric and antisymmetric representations in the
following way:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now we are ready to introduce the transfer matrix in a given
representation. The @xmath -matrix in the representation @xmath is
defined as follows:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.70)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here the auxiliary particle is in the representation @xmath . All the
physical particles ⁹ ⁹ 9 In fact these ”physical particles” are the
nodes of a spin chain. Each node carries an inhomogeneity @xmath . are
in the fundamental representation. For the rectangular representations
we will additionally use the notation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the equation ( 1.2 ), which is valid for two arbitrary
representations, we can prove that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.72)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore we can diagonalize simultaneously all the transfer matrices.

The transfer matrices in different rectangular representations are not
independent but satisfy the so called fusion or Hirota equations. In the
simplest case of the fusion of two transfer matrices in the fundamental
representation the Hirota equation reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

The proof of this relation is most easily done graphically:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (1.74)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

To obtain the transfer matrix in the antisymmetric representation in
derivation ( 1.74 ) we should use the representation ( 1.64 ) for the
projector @xmath , Yang-Baxter equation, and cyclicity of the trace.

If we would scatter the fundamental representation with the trivial one,
there would be no interchange of color. Therefore it is natural to
define the corresponding @xmath -matrix as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.75)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then the Baxter polynomial @xmath can be considered as a transfer matrix
in the trivial representation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.76)
  -- -------- -- --------

Moreover, using fusion procedure and ( 1.75 ) we conclude that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.77)
  -- -------- -- --------

and thus

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.78)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore equation ( 1.73 ) can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.79)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation is generalizable for arbitrary rectangular
representations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.80)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 1.80 ) is known as the Hirota equation.

The transfer matrices are defined on the lattice bounded by the
rectangle @xmath which any meaningful Young diagram should fit. To make
the Hirota equations valid for any integer values of @xmath and @xmath
we define @xmath on the lines @xmath and @xmath by the relations ( 1.78
). Outside the rectangle and these two lines @xmath . Therefore, the
fusion relations ( 1.80 ) are nontrivial on the shape shown in Fig. 1.7
.

The Hirota equation simplifies on the boundary of the rectangle. Let us
take for example the lower boundary ( @xmath ). The fusion relation on
it is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.81)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is solved as a product of left and right moving waves. On the other
hand @xmath . Therefore we have only the left-moving wave.

The same situation occurs on the left boundary. On the upper boundary we
also have the transfer matrix in the trivial representation. However now
the corresponding @xmath -matrix is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.82)
  -- -------- -- --------

The generalized permutation is not zero, as it was on the upper and the
left boundaries, but is equal to @xmath . For example: @xmath due to the
fact that @xmath is proportional to the completely antisymmetric tensor.

Due to ( 1.82 ) we have @xmath . Combining three boundaries together we
see that there is only the left-moving wave on the boundary generated at
the origin by @xmath .

#### 1.5 Nested Bethe Ansatz via Backlund transform

The Hirota equation ( 1.80 ) is a discrete integrable system in the
sense that it can be obtained as a compatibility condition of the system
of the linear equations [ 40 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (1.83)
  -- -------- -- --------

that can be also represented graphically as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.84)
  -- -------- -- --------

An interesting fact is that if we consider ( 1.5 ) as the equations on
@xmath then the consistency condition gives us fusion relations ( 1.80 )
on @xmath ! Therefore @xmath can be thought as the transfer matrix of
some integrable system. The transfer matrix @xmath is called the
Backlund transform of @xmath .

There are two possible and different solutions to ( 1.5 ) which generate
respectively the first-type (BT1) and the second-type (BT2) Backlund
transformations. BT2 is relevant for the study of supersymmetric groups
and is discussed in chapter 4 . Here we discuss BT1.

For BT1 the strip on which the functions @xmath are nonzero is given by
the constraints @xmath , that is the number of rows is diminished by 1.
Thus @xmath can be viewed as the transfer matrices for an @xmath
integrable system. From ( 1.5 ) one can see that the boundary of the
strip of @xmath carries left-moving wave induced by the left-moving wave
of @xmath . To obtain a rational integrable system we have to choose the
value of @xmath to be a polynomial.

The idea of solving the Hirota equations is to perform a sufficient
number of Backlund transforms so that we are eventually left with a
strip with only one row. To make the notation systematic we define by
@xmath the transfer matrices associated with the @xmath group. The
boundary condition is given by @xmath . For the rational integrable
system @xmath is a polynomial. The zeroes of @xmath are denoted by
@xmath . Subsequent application of Backlund transformations generates
the sequence

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.85)
  -- -------- -- --------

The linear equation ( 1.84 ) evaluated for the gray rectangle in Fig.
1.8 has a particular interest for us. This equation gives a relation
between @xmath , @xmath and the Baxter polynomials @xmath , @xmath .
Indeed, this equation reads as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.86)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the notation @xmath is used.

Since @xmath , the recursive relation ( 1.86 ), known also as a Baxter
equation, gives us the possibility to express @xmath in terms of Baxter
polynomials only:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.87)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is enough to solve the Hirota system since all the @xmath can be
found from the knowledge of @xmath and @xmath .

In ( 1.87 ) we recognize up to an overall factor the expression ( 1.37
). The Bethe equations can be read from ( 1.87 ) as the condition that
@xmath is a polynomial by construction and therefore does not have
poles.

The Hirota equations were obtained as a relation between transfer
matrices. They give a set of Bethe equations via the sequence of
Backlund transformations. The essential point in this derivation of the
Bethe equations is that the boundary conditions for the transfer
matrices and the transfer matrices themselves are required to be
polynomials. It is also possible to impose different requirements on the
analytical structure of the transfer matrices. Then @xmath will be
considered as a transfer matrices based on an @xmath -matrix different
from ( 1.59 ). In this way we can obtain for example trigonometric and
elliptic integrable systems. The transfer-matrices of the Hirota system
that was proposed for the AdS/CFT [ 44 ] contain square root branch
points.

### Chapter 2 Two-dimensional integrable field theories

#### 2.1 Two-dimensional sigma-models

The integrable 1+1 dimensional quantum field theories (IQFT) give us
another example of the systems that can be solved by the Bethe Ansatz
techniques. A remarkable development in this direction started in the
late 70’s with the realization of the fact that the scattering matrix in
these theories can be found exactly [ 7 ] .

In this and the next chapter we will consider the following two examples
of the integrable models: @xmath chiral Gross-Neveu model (GN) and
@xmath principal chiral field model (PCF). Our choice is dictated by the
simplicity of these models. In chapter 9 we also study the @xmath vector
model. The actions for these three models are given by:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath               
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

All three theories can be treated on a similar footing. They are
determined by the coupling constant @xmath and the parameter @xmath -
size of the matrix of a symmetry group. These theories are
asymptotically free. Therefore, at large energy scales they can be
studied perturbatively.

The infrared catastrophe makes the perturbative description
inappropriate at low energies. It is believed that the spectrum of these
theories develops a mass gap. The mass scale comes through the mechanism
of the dimensional transmutation and is given through the beta-function
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

The chiral Gross-Neveu model ¹ ¹ 1 It is also known as a two-dimensional
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model or a massless Thirring model. is a model with a
four-fermion interaction and continuous chiral symmetry @xmath . It was
discussed in [ 67 ] together with the other fermion field theories with
quartic interaction. In particular it was shown in the large @xmath
limit that the operator @xmath acquires on the quantum level a nonzero
average proportional to @xmath . In the large @xmath limit it is
possible to identify the particle content of the model and calculate the
masses of the particles. The theory contains one massless particle which
is invariant under the @xmath group but transforms under the action of
the @xmath chiral symmetry. There are also massive particles which are
blind to the chiral symmetry and do not interact with the massless
particle. There are @xmath different types of massive particles. The
@xmath -th type transforms under an antisymmetric representation @xmath
of the @xmath group. Since the massless particle is completely decoupled
from the massive ones, we will not consider it in the following.

The PCF for finite values of @xmath was solved by Polyakov and Wiegmann
[ 68 , 69 ] . In [ 70 ] the large @xmath solution of this model using
different means was given. There are also @xmath different types of
massive particles. The @xmath -th type transforms under the @xmath
representation of the @xmath symmetry group of the system.

The @xmath vector sigma model was solved at large @xmath [ 71 , 72 ] .
This solution shows the presence of the only one particle multiplet in
the vector representation of the @xmath group.

#### 2.2 Scattering matrix

As we see, the sigma models can be exactly solved at large values of
@xmath . The theories can be also exactly solved at finite values of
@xmath if to assume theirs integrability and make an assumption about
the particle content of the theory ² ² 2 Using integrability, the masses
of the particles could be exactly found at finite @xmath [ 73 ] as we
discuss in chapter 9 . . More precisely, we can exactly find the
scattering matrix [ 7 ] . The arguments go as follows.

First, the infinite number of the conserved charges implies conservation
of the number of particles. The reason for this is that the @xmath -th
conserved charge @xmath acting on a free particle with momenta @xmath
gives roughly speaking @xmath . So @xmath is the total momentum of the
system and @xmath is the total energy of the system. Therefore we have
an infinite set of conservation laws

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

that can be satisfied only if the number of particles is conserved and
the momenta interchange.

Second, the scattering process factorizes into @xmath processes. The
argument of why it happens is the following ³ ³ 3 For a rigorous
treatment see [ 74 ] . The particle is described by a wave packet

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Action of @xmath and @xmath generates the translation in space and time
respectively (as it should). Let us consider the action of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Expanding the term @xmath around a saddle point value @xmath we see that
the action of @xmath shifts the wave packet by the value that depends on
the momentum @xmath of the particle. Therefore the action of @xmath on a
system of particles will shift each particle by a different distance.
So, using this operator we can always represent any scattering as a
combination of @xmath scattered processes. Therefore we should know only
@xmath scattering matrix to define the system.

The same reasoning with application of @xmath leads to the Yang-Baxter
equation ( 1.12 ) which is depicted in Fig. 1.1 .

To impose further constraints on the structure of the @xmath -matrix we
will use the fact that we are dealing with the relativistic quantum
field theory ⁴ ⁴ 4 The pedagogical discussion of the analytical
structure of the scattering matrix can be found for example in [ 75 ] .
. The two to two scattering process is defined by the @xmath -point
function shown in Fig. 2.1 . For simplicity we consider the scattering
of particles with equal masses. Since in two dimensions the momenta are
only interchanged after scattering, the scattering matrix depends on
only the one invariant. For this invariant we can take

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

or the difference of rapidities @xmath which is related to @xmath
through:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The invariant of the @xmath -channel is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The amplitude of the reverse process can be obtained simply by replacing
@xmath with @xmath . Therefore the unitarity condition reads

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

We can pass from @xmath process to @xmath process (overline means
antiparticles and charge conjugation) by simple change of the sign of
@xmath . This leads to the crossing equations

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

The @xmath -matrix as a function of the @xmath variable has square root
branch points at @xmath and @xmath which correspond to two-particle and
particle-antiparticle thresholds. The on-shell two-particle scattering
is given by @xmath for @xmath , the on-shell particle-antiparticle
scattering is given by @xmath for @xmath . The square root cuts are
resolved after introduction of the rapidity variable @xmath via ( 2.2 ).

The @xmath -matrix is a meromorphic function of @xmath . The physical
@xmath -sheet is mapped into the strip @xmath . The poles on the
imaginary axes of @xmath -plane and inside this strip correspond to the
physical particles in the theory. These particles can be thought as
bound states of the scattered particles. We can understand this
correspondence from tree level diagrams:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the trick with @xmath one can calculate the scattering which
includes these bound particles in the following way:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

The invariance under the symmetry of the system, the Yang-Baxter
equation ( 1.12 ), the unitarity ( 2.8 ) and crossing ( 2.9 )
conditions, and the assumption on the pole structure inside the physical
strip @xmath uniquely fix the two-particle scattering matrix and
therefore completely determine the system.

The Yang-Baxter equation and invariance under the symmetry fixes the
@xmath -matrix up to an overall scalar factor. The scattering matrix
discussed in the first chapter also satisfies these two conditions.
Therefore the algebraic structure of the @xmath -matrices in two cases
is the same and we can apply the Bethe Ansatz techniques developed in
the first chapter.

The unitarity, crossing, and the pole structure are the physical
constraints on the @xmath -matrix. The assumption on the pole structure
is a consequence of an assumption on the particle content of the theory.
This assumption is hard to be proven exactly. It is usually confirmed by
the exact large @xmath solution. Another possibility to verify this
assumption is to study the renorm-group behavior and Borel summability
properties of the system which we will discuss in chapter 9 .

The knowledge of the @xmath -matrix allows solving the theory at large
volume with the help of the Bethe Ansatz as we will discuss now on the
example of the PCF and GN models.

#### 2.3 PCF and Gross-Neveu model

The particle content of GN model includes in particular particles in the
fundamental representation. The PCF model contains in particular
particles in the fundamental @xmath fundamental representation. We
choose the following normalization of the rapidities of these particles

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this normalization the Bethe equations will resemble most the Bethe
equations ( 1.22 ) of the XXX spin chain.

The scattering matrix of the fundamental particles was determined to
have the following form [ 68 ] :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.13)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.14)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

There is a relation between @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The scalar factors can be also rewritten in terms of the shift
operators. For this let us use the following definition (see also
definition ( 1.50 )):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

and similar expressions for other gamma functions. Naively, the l.h.s.
of ( 2.16 ) should be understood as product of poles

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Of course, this product should be regularized. We will always use
regularization which leads to the gamma function. For more details see
appendix A .

Using the representation ( 2.16 ) for the gamma functions one can write:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.18)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The first equalities for the expressions of @xmath and @xmath are exact
in view of the definition ( 2.16 ). It is worth to recall that the
asymptotic behavior of these scalar factors is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.19)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

This asymptotic behavior is not evident from the representation ( 2.3 )
but can be found if to use ( 2.16 ).

The second equalities in ( 2.3 ) have no precise meaning and are given
for heuristic reasons. In particular, the second equalities formally
suggest that @xmath . This is not true of course, however this
suggestion means that @xmath and @xmath differ only by a CDD factor. The
CDD factor, which is in our case @xmath , is a factor multiplication by
which leaves a scattering matrix obeying the crossing equations. It is
possible to fix this factor by the requirement of a precise structure of
poles in the physical strip.

###### Bound states

The physical strip is given by @xmath . The fundamental particles can
form bound states if the @xmath -matrix has poles inside this strip.

The @xmath -matrices ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.3 ) have a pole at @xmath in the
purely antisymmetric channel. This means that bound states are particles
in the antisymmetric representations: @xmath for GN and @xmath for PCF.
The mass of the obtained particle is easily calculated from the
conservation law:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

This bound state (fused particle) can be represented by two particles
with rapidity difference equal to @xmath . Due to the existence of the
higher conserved charges any scattering with such bound state is
equivalent to successive scattering with its constituents. One can build
therefore the correspondent @xmath -matrix. The procedure is almost the
same as for the fusion procedure discussed in Sec. 1.4 . The only
difference is that the fused @xmath -matrix should satisfy physical
requirements of unitarity and crossing and therefore has a different
from the fused @xmath -matrix overall scalar factor.

It is instructive to compare the bound state with the strings in the XXX
spin chain. The string configurations in the XXX spin chain can be also
considered as bound states, which however reflect the analytical
structure of the @xmath -matrix ( 1.59 ). Since for the XXX spin chain
@xmath , Im @xmath has opposite sign with Im @xmath . Therefore strings
correspond to zeroes of @xmath for @xmath . These zeroes appear in the
symmetric channel of scattering.

Since strings in the XXX spin chain are bound states in the symmetric
channel we can form them at any nested level of the Bethe Ansatz. In the
case of the @xmath GN and PCF, the bound states appear in the
antisymmetric channel. Thus these bound states should correspond to
collection of Bethe roots on different levels of the nested Bethe
Ansatz. This collection of roots will be constructed in the next
subsection.

One can perform scattering of the bound state with a fundamental
particle. The scattering matrix of this process again has a pole inside
the physical strip. The easy way to see this is to notice that this pole
should be due to a pole of the scattering with one of the two
constituents of the bound state. The constituents of the bound state
have rapidities @xmath . Therefore the pole occurs at @xmath .

Continuing in a similar way we find that the considered sigma models
contain particles in the representations @xmath ( @xmath ) for @xmath .
The masses of the particles come from the conservation law:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz for GN.

Once the @xmath -matrix of the system is known, one can build the wave
function for each state in the same way as it was done for the XXX spin
chain. If we consider the theory on a circle, the periodicity of the
wave function leads to a nested Bethe Ansatz. Its construction is
completely parallel to that of the XXX spin chain. The answer for the
Gross-Neveu model is the following. There are momentum carrying roots
@xmath and @xmath types of nested roots @xmath , where @xmath denotes
the nested level. The Bethe Ansatz equations read

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.23)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the usual Cartan matrix of the Dynkin diagram for the
@xmath Lie algebra.

Sometimes this set of Bethe Ansatz equations is depicted by a kind of
Dynkin diagram shown in Fig. 2.3 .

An important difference with the XXX spin chain is that the Bethe Ansatz
( 2.3 ) is asymptotic. It is valid only when the volume @xmath of the
system is large. Otherwise the notion of scattering and free particles
would be impossible. The exact expression for the energy of the system
in the finite volume is different from the answer given by the
asymptotic Bethe Ansatz (ABA) by the correction of order @xmath .

Although the Bethe Ansatz above is formally for the particles in the
fundamental representation, it contains all the other particles as well.
They appear as special string-type configurations.

To recover the configurations which correspond to the bound states we
first note that from the fusion procedure we know that the @xmath
-particle should contain @xmath rapidities @xmath which form a @xmath
-string. Let us take a rapidity @xmath which belongs to this string and
which has a positive imaginary part . For @xmath we see that @xmath .
Since @xmath has no poles in the physical strip, we need to have a
nested root @xmath . Equivalently, for each rapidity @xmath with
negative imaginary part we have @xmath . Therefore the existence of the
@xmath -string of @xmath -s requires presence of the @xmath -string of
@xmath -s with the same center.

Following a similar logic one can show that @xmath -string of @xmath -s
and @xmath -string of @xmath -s imply the @xmath -string of @xmath -s.
The iteration procedure is performed until we reach the string of the
length @xmath . Therefore the bound particles in GN are described by
stacks shown in Fig. 2.4 .

If we denote by @xmath the center of the stack that contains @xmath
@xmath roots ( @xmath -stack) (it is associated with the @xmath bound
state) then the Bethe Ansatz equations for the centers of stacks will
have the following form:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.24)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.25)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Remarkably, each bound state interacts with only one level of nested
Bethe roots. And this interaction is the same as the interaction between
different nested levels (see also Fig. 3.1 ).

###### Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz for PCF.

The asymptotic Bethe Ansatz for PCF contains two wings of nested levels.
We will denote the nested Bethe roots by @xmath and @xmath , where
@xmath and @xmath stand for right and left wings.

The Bethe equations are the following:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.26)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The identification of the bound states is similar to the case of GN
model. The only modification is that since @xmath , a @xmath -string of
@xmath -s induces @xmath -strings on both left and right wings. As a
result we have the structure of stacks shown in Fig. 2.6 .

If we denote by @xmath the center of the stack that contains @xmath
@xmath roots then the Bethe Ansatz equations will have the following
form:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
                       @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.27)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.28)
                       @xmath   @xmath

### Chapter 3 IQFT as a continuous limit of integrable spin chains

An important problem to study is what field theories can be obtained in
the continuous limit of integrable spin chains. Assuming that
integrability and symmetry of the system is preserved in the continuous
limit we may expect to recover from the @xmath symmetric spin chains the
@xmath GN model, just based on the argument of the universality of low
energy effective theories.

In this chapter we study excitations over the antiferromagnetic vacuum
of the @xmath XXX spin chain ¹ ¹ 1 This study for the @xmath case was
first time correctly done by Faddeev and Takhtajan [ 76 , 77 , 78 ] .
These authors also found the scattering matrix of the excitations using
the method of [ 79 ] . The general case was studied in [ 80 ] . . This
vacuum is interesting since it is invariant under the @xmath group. The
scattering of the excitations, which are also called spinons, depends on
the representation in which the spin chain was defined. For the
fundamental representation the scattering of low energetic spinons in
the infinite volume is described by the same scattering matrix as the
one for the @xmath GN model. In the limit of the infinite spin
representation the low energy scattering matrix is identical with the
one of the PCF model [ 68 , 81 ] . Interestingly, the PCF model has a
larger @xmath symmetry.

A nontrivial scalar factor in the scattering matrix, such as @xmath in (
2.3 ), is recovered from the algebraic Bethe Ansatz equations as an
effective interaction of spinons. From the point of view of the Bethe
Ansatz, spinons are not elementary particles but are holes in a Dirac
sea of magnons - excitations over ferromagnetic vacuum. Curiously, the
scattering matrix of spinons obtained in this purely algebraic way is
crossing-invariant, although the XXX spin chain does not have such
discrete symmetry.

In opposite to the GN and PCF models, the spinon spectrum is gapless. To
obtain massive particles we may consider an inhomogeneous spin chain
which is also known as a light cone spin chain ² ² 2 Such spin chain was
proposed in [ 81 ] . The Bethe equations for it were used before in [ 68
] were the PCF model was solved in terms of a certain fermionic model. .

The described above scattering picture is applicable when we consider
sigma models in the infinite volume. In sections 3.4 and 3.5 we discuss
applicability of the spin chain discretization for the finite volume
case. We recall a thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) [ 82 , 83 ] and
suggest that the @xmath -functions which appear in the context of TBA
should be identified with the transfer matrices of the light cone spin
chain. We show that this is indeed the case on the simplest example of
equally polarized spinons of the @xmath GN model.

#### 3.1 Excitations in the antiferromagnetic @xmath XXX spin chain

We will first consider in details the @xmath case, which will be our
guiding example for a more complicated cases of @xmath models. The Bethe
equations for the @xmath XXX spin chain,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

were derived from the scattering theory of the excitations over the
ferromagnetic vacuum. An interesting physics arise if to consider the
Hamiltonian with opposite sign and therefore excitations over the
antiferromagnetic vacuum. An important property of the antiferromagnetic
vacuum is that it is a trivial representation of the symmetry group ³ ³
3 for the spin chain of even length which we will consider in the
following. For the antiferromagnetic spin chain of the odd length the
lowest energy state is doubly degenerated. .

We have at our disposal excitations over the ferromagnetic vacuum
(magnons). The question is to build an effective theory in which the
vacuum is a Dirac sea of magnons. For general length of the spin chain
this problem was not solved. However, in the thermodynamic limit @xmath
the Bethe equations are considerably simplified and the problem can be
solved. The usual way to solve it is to introduce the integral equation
for the density of Bethe roots, as it is done for example in [ 51 ] . We
will use a slightly different description, in which we deal with the
resolvents and functional equations on them. The advantage is that all
the integral kernels which appear are replaced with the rational
functions of the shift operator ⁴ ⁴ 4 Fourier transform also leads to
these rational functions. The functional approach has an advantage of
keeping explicitly the analytical structure of the resolvents and
therefore of the density functions. This is especially useful for the
problems discussed in the third part of this work. .

###### Holomorphic projection

To derive the functional equations for the resolvents let us start from
a simple configuration which contains only real Bethe roots. The main
assumption which goes through all derivations is that in the large
@xmath limit one or other terms in the l.h.s. of the Baxter equation (
1.39 )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

can be neglected, depending on whether we are in the upper or in the
lower half plane of the rapidity variable. As we discussed in section
1.3 , in this approximation the transfer-matrix is represented as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath stands for the Baxter polynomial of holes

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore the Baxter equation reduces to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

If we introduce the resolvents

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

and take derivative of the logarithm of ( 3.5 ), we will get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath .

At first glance this derivation seems to be not rigorous. However, the
equations ( 3.1 ) are equivalent to the linear integral equation which
is derived in the canonical approach (used for example in the lectures [
51 ] ). Indeed, taking the difference of the functional equations ( 3.1
) on the real axis we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

Using the fact that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

it is easy to see that ( 3.8 ) is equivalent to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is the integral Bethe Ansatz equation for the XXX spin chain.

To go back from ( 3.10 ) to ( 3.1 ) we integrate ( 3.10 ) with a Cauchy
kernel. We call this operation the holomorphic projection. The word
holomorphic stands for passing from the density which is the function
defined only on the real axis to the resolvent which is an analytical
function everywhere in the complex plane except on the support of the
density. The word projection stands for the fact that the expression (
3.8 ) can be split into two equations ( 3.1 ) defined on the upper and
the lower half planes.

###### Bethe equations for holes

The true excitations over the antiferromagnetic vacuum are holes. The
equations ( 3.1 ) can be rewritten as ⁵ ⁵ 5 We omit the equation in the
l.h.p. since it is just conjugated to the one in the u.h.p.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

Remarkably, such an equation can be obtained in the large @xmath limit
from the following Bethe Ansatz:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is defined through

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath is nothing but the @xmath -matrix of the @xmath GN model for
scattering of equally polarized particles. The rapidities @xmath
describe holes from the point of view of the ferromagnetic spin chain.
In this derivation we did not require that the number of holes should be
infinite. So the equation ( 3.11 ) can describe few excitations over the
antiferromagnetic vacuum as well.

What is missing for matching ( 3.12 ) with the Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz
of the GN model is the nested level of the Bethe equations and the
correct expression for @xmath .

We will recover the correct nested structure if we will take into
account also all string configurations in the XXX spin chain. The
functional equation that describes the thermodynamic limit of the
complete set of Bethe equations ( 1.58 ) is the following:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

The second term on the l.h.s. comes from the operator @xmath . We can
split this operator in the following way:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Each of two terms in the r.h.s. of ( 3.15 ) is a sum of finite number of
shift operators. The first term contains only shifts in the positive
imaginary direction. Only this term survives under the holomorphic
projection in the upper half plane.

A remarkable property of the operator @xmath is that it is an element of
the inverse deformed Cartan matrix ( 1.56 ) of the @xmath algebra ⁶ ⁶ 6
We are grateful to Paul Zinn-Justin for pointing out this fact. We would
like also to refer to his PhD thesis [ 55 ] where many ideas of this
chapter are also discussed. . Therefore the equation ( 3.14 ) can be
also rewritten as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the last formula we used the operator @xmath to put the expression
into a more symmetric form. To avoid ambiguities of how the action of
this shift operator is defined, we should consider ( 3.16 ) in the
region @xmath , not @xmath . Then this equation can be analytically
continued.

To make the particle-hole transformation ⁷ ⁷ 7 Passing to functional
equations that allow to interpret holes as the roots of a certain Bethe
Ansatz equation. more explicit we introduce

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

The equations ( 3.16 ) for @xmath can be written also as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is easy to see that it leads to the Bethe equation of the @xmath GN
for the momentum-carrying particle (but with different @xmath ).

The equations ( 3.16 ) for @xmath are written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

These equations have the same form as ( 3.16 ) except for the replacing
the source term @xmath by @xmath . The same equations can be obtained
from the nested level of the Bethe Ansatz for @xmath GN. Interestingly,
the centers of the strings of the length two play the role of the real
roots of the nested Bethe equations.

###### A model with the gap in the spectrum

Still, the obtained equations do not have correct expression for the
momentum. In fact, the energy of a hole is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

The spectrum of the theory does not contain a gap, therefore we can
obtain only a massless field theory.

To cure the situation we follow the approach of Faddeev and Reshetikhin
[ 81 ] who suggested to consider the XXX spin chain with alternating
inhomogeneities @xmath such that the Bethe Ansatz is written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

The same equations appeared in the solution of PCF by Polyakov and
Wiegmann [ 68 ] before [ 81 ] . However the equations ( 3.21 ) had a
different meaning; they described a fermionic model with a four-fermion
interaction. The reason of equivalence is that the first-quantized
version of the fermionic model are the particles interacting through the
@xmath -potential. Such system is solved by the same Bethe Ansatz
equations as the ones for the XXX spin chain. In fact, exactly the
Polyakov-Wiegmann approach was used in [ 80 ] for the solution of the
PCF model for an arbitrary simple group. Translation of this result to
the Faddeev-Reshetikhin picture is straightforward and for the @xmath
case is given in the next sections.

Let us introduce the spacing @xmath between the nodes of the spin chain.
The energy for the excitations over the antiferromagnetic vacuum can be
written as:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.22)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

There are low energy excitations for small values of @xmath . In the
limit @xmath we obtain for them:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

To obtain a finite value for the mass @xmath we have to consider a
proper limit

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (3.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this limit we recover exactly the integral equations which follow
from the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz of @xmath GN.

Now we will generalize the obtained results to the case of @xmath group
and then to the case of PCF.

#### 3.2 Generalization to the case of @xmath Gn.

The generalization is straightforward. Let us label the resolvent for
strings in the position @xmath as @xmath . The label @xmath corresponds
to the nested level of the Bethe root. The label @xmath labels the
length of the string. The general Bethe equations are written as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.25)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where @xmath is the resolvent for the source term. It equals to @xmath
in the homogeneous case and to @xmath in the case of the light-cone spin
chain.

Remarkably, the equation ( 3.25 ) within the usage of the deformed
Cartan matrix ( 1.56 ) can be rewritten as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

We use two different Cartan matrices. One is of @xmath Dynkin diagram,
another one is of @xmath Dynkin diagram. We reflect these distinctions
in the superscripted indexes of @xmath .

This form of the functional equation is usually described in terms of
the Dynkin-type graph in Fig. 3.1 with @xmath graph in the horizontal
direction and with @xmath in the vertical direction.

To obtain the @xmath GN model we perform a particle-hole transformation
on the roots of type @xmath . For this we introduce the resolvents

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

The equations ( 3.26 ) for @xmath describe the nested levels of the
@xmath GN. As in the @xmath case, the roots @xmath play the role of the
source terms.

The equations ( 3.26 ) for @xmath lead to the following equations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

We see that interaction between the states is determined by the inverse
Cartan matrix. It is straightforward to check that we get a correct
expression for @xmath given in ( 2.25 ).

The inverse deformed Cartan matrix can be written explicitly as ⁸ ⁸ 8
The generalization of this expression for the distinguished Dynkin
diagram of @xmath algebra was given in [ 84 ] .

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we used the notations @xmath for @xmath -numbers. This inverse
Cartan matrix should be understood as a series over positive powers of
@xmath for the equations written in the u.h.p. and as a series over
negative powers for the equations in the l.h.p.

The momenta @xmath of a @xmath -particle of the GN model should enter
into the integral equation for @xmath (density associated with @xmath )
as @xmath . We can calculate this expression from the explicit form of
the inverse Cartan matrix:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

Explicit calculation with the help of inverse Laplace transform gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the parity properties of @xmath we obtain in the limit analogous
to ( 3.1 )

  -- -- -- --------
           (3.32)
  -- -- -- --------

which leads to the following effective mass parameter:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

We see that masses of the particles obtained from a light-cone spin
chain are the same as it should be in the @xmath GN model (see ( 2.22
)).

#### 3.3 Generalization to the case of @xmath Pcf.

If we consider the XXX spin chain in the fundamental representation of
the @xmath group, the dynamics of low energy excitations over the
antiferromagnetic vacuum is described by the GN model. To obtain in
continuous limit the PCF model we have to consider the spin chain in a
different representation [ 81 ] . The general Bethe Ansatz for arbitrary
representation of @xmath group is given by ( 1.38 ). The version of the
Bethe Ansatz which includes a string hypothesis is given by the equation
( 1.58 ). Remarkably, the Bethe Ansatz which corresponds to a
rectangular representation with Young table given by @xmath rows and
@xmath columns leads to a simple functional equation on the resolvents:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

To obtain a PCF we have to consider the case @xmath and @xmath . The
antiferromagnetic vacuum corresponds to the maximal filling of strings
of type @xmath , @xmath .

As usual, we perform a particle-hole transformation for the nodes @xmath
:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since the resolvent decreases at infinity one can approximate in the
large @xmath limit

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using this approximation, we can write for the central nodes ⁹ ⁹ 9 the
nodes that a subject of a particle-hole transformation. :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

These are functional Bethe Ansatz equations that can be also derived
from the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz of @xmath PCF. To obtain the massive
theory we use the limit ( 3.1 ) which is the same as in the case of the
GN model.

The nested Bethe equations come from the nodes that are on the left and
on the right from the central nodes. We see that in the limit @xmath
two, left and right, @xmath symmetries appear.

#### 3.4 Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz

In the previous sections we saw that the functional Bethe equations for
the excitations over the antiferromagnetic vacuum coincide with the
equations that can be obtained from the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz for the
sigma-models. It is therefore natural to ask the question whether
light-cone spin chains provide a correct lattice regularization of the
sigma model. If it is the case we will be able to describe sigma-models
in a finite volume. A possible way to describe a system in a finite
volume known as a thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) [ 82 , 83 ] . Our
goal would be to compare the description given by TBA with the
description which is suggested by the spin chain discretization. In this
section the TBA approach is reviewed. In the next section we argue that
the spin chain leads to the same results and support this suggestion by
the simplest example.

###### TBA for calculation of the ground state energy.

Let us consider the theory on the torus with periods @xmath and @xmath .
The sigma-model in the finite volume @xmath is recovered in the large
@xmath limit. The basic idea of the TBA is to write the partition
function in two different ways:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here @xmath ( @xmath ) is the Hamiltonian that generates translation in
the @xmath ( @xmath ) direction. Since the theory is relativistically
invariant these Hamiltonians are the same. The energy of the ground
state of the sigma-model at finite @xmath can be found as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

We can calculate partition function since the energy spectrum at large
@xmath is described by the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. In the large @xmath
limit a saddle point approximation is used. Then @xmath is given by a
free energy that can be found by the minimization of

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the entropy of the macroscopic state with given energy.

We use an assumption that in the thermodynamic limit the Bethe roots
organize themselves into strings. Then the macroscopic state in the
thermodynamic limit is described by densities of the strings. We already
know that the functional equations that describe sigma model can be
written in a much simpler form if we interchange the role of particles
and holes for the momentum carrying roots. Therefore let us denote by
@xmath ( @xmath ) the densities of strings (corresponding holes) of type
@xmath in the case when they are not momentum carrying. The momentum
carrying strings will be denoted in inverse way - @xmath will stand for
densities of holes and @xmath for densities of particles.

The densities satisfy the equation ¹⁰ ¹⁰ 10 In the literature the
notation @xmath instead of @xmath is often used. Our choice of notation
is motivated by the fact that @xmath is given by the inverse Cartan
matrix (up to multiplication by @xmath or @xmath ). The kernel @xmath
does not have such clear algebraic interpretation.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a source term. For GN or PCF @xmath and @xmath .

The free energy @xmath is given by the following equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the first term is @xmath of ( 3.40 ) and the second one is the
entropy of the system.

Minimization of the free energy leads to the TBA equations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

The ground state energy given by ( 3.39 ) then can be evaluated as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the case of the GN and PCF models one can further simplify the
expressions. First, the kernels @xmath can be most generally represented
as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

where coefficients @xmath are symmetric with respect to interchange of
@xmath and @xmath . We conclude therefore that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us introduce the functions @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then the TBA equations for @xmath will be written as ¹¹ ¹¹ 11 The sum
over @xmath is from @xmath to @xmath for GN and from @xmath to @xmath
for PCF. We always assign @xmath to the momentum-carrying nodes.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here @xmath denotes the integral kernel whose holomorphic projection is
the deformed Cartan matrix @xmath . Let us evaluate this kernel. If the
function @xmath of integration is analytic in the strip @xmath , then

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.49)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where @xmath is the resolvent of @xmath and @xmath means analytical
continuation of @xmath to the point @xmath from the upper half plane. We
see that for the functions analytic in the strip @xmath , @xmath
coincides with @xmath .

Let us therefore act with @xmath on the equation ( 3.48 ). It is
straightforward to check that @xmath is a zero mode of this action.
Therefore we will get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

or more explicitly

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

We have obtained the functional @xmath -system. The algebraic structure
of ( 3.50 ) is determined by the equations ( 3.26 ). Therefore the
structure of @xmath -system reflects the strings hypothesis and the
interaction between strings.

###### TBA in the case of excited states.

The set of equations ( 3.51 ) requires appropriate boundary conditions
to have a unique solution. Boundary conditions which follow from ( 3.43
) lead to the solution which gives the energy of the ground state. The
results of [ 85 , 86 ] suggest that changing of the boundary conditions
allows describing a certain class of excited states. The energy of such
excited states is given by generalization of ( 3.44 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are solutions of

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is often believed that all the excited states of the sigma model can
be described as certain solutions of the @xmath -system. The energies of
these states are given by ( 3.52 ). As was shown in [ 87 ] for a wide
class of excited states of the @xmath sigma model, equations ( 3.53 )
reduce in the large volume limit to the Bethe Ansatz equations.
Therefore ( 3.53 ) are thought as exact Bethe Ansatz equations for the
systems in finite volume.

The conjecture about applicability of the @xmath -system for the
description of the excited states is supported by the spin chain point
of view on the problem as we will now discuss.

#### 3.5 Transfer matrices of spin chain as @xmath-functions of TBA.

The functional @xmath -system ( 3.51 ) can be rewritten as the Hirota
system ( 1.80 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

if we introduce the @xmath -functions by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

Relation ( 3.55 ) defines the functions @xmath modulo the gauge
transformation

  -- -- -- --------
           (3.56)
  -- -- -- --------

The Hirota system ( 3.54 ) is also invariant under ( 3.56 ), therefore
there is an equivalence between @xmath -system and Hirota system modulo
gauge transformations.

A priori @xmath -functions defined by ( 3.55 ) do not have meaning of
transfer matrices. However ( 3.54 ) has the same form as the fusion
relations for the transfer matrices of the spin chain. Based on this
observation we suggest that @xmath functions obtained from ( 3.55 )
coincide with transfer matrices of the spin chain discretization of the
sigma model.

Here we will show this equivalence on the simplest case - @xmath GN
model with the excitations polarized in the same direction. A more
general case would be the subject of our future work.

Since all particles are equally polarized, the spin chain is described
by the equations ( 3.21 ). In Fig. 3.3 we show a typical solution of
this equation. The red dots represent the zeroes of the Baxter
polynomial and the blue dots represent the zeroes of @xmath . The
complex zeroes of @xmath are accompanying ¹² ¹² 12 This term was
introduced in Sec. 4.5 . roots and do not have physical meaning. The
real zeroes of @xmath are holes. They play the role of physical
excitations. Their energy is proportional to @xmath and is also plotted
in Fig. 3.3 (as a potential with a well).

In the Faddeev-Reshetikhin limit ( 3.1 ) the holes inside the well in
Fig. 3.3 describe the massive excitations of the GN model. The holes
outside the well should describe the massless field theory. However in
the limit ( 3.1 ) massless excitations do not interact with the massive
modes as we will see below.

Let us use ( 3.55 ) to define @xmath functions based on the transfer
matrices of the spin chain. These @xmath functions will be denoted as
@xmath to distinguish them from the @xmath -functions of TBA. From (
3.55 ) we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath .

The function @xmath satisfies the equations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath are the rapidities of spinon excitations which are true
particles in the antiferromagnetic case, we should identify ( 3.58 )
with ( 3.53 ) and therefore we expect that @xmath . From this
identification it also follows that all excited states should satisfy (
3.58 ) which cannot be shown from the TBA point of view.

The transfer-matrix @xmath satisfies the Baxter equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

We have already discussed (see Sec. 1.3 ) that @xmath is represented in
the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath in the large @xmath limit. In the large @xmath limit we can
also approximate the Baxter equation by:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us verify if the approximation ( 3.61 ) is valid in the limit ( 3.1
). We are interested in the dynamics of excitations inside the well,
therefore @xmath . As it follows from ( 1.40 ), approximation ( 3.61 )
can be trusted ¹³ ¹³ 13 We consider the Bethe roots inside the well. For
these roots the last term in ( 1.40 ) is small if @xmath is at the
distance from the source origin smaller then @xmath . This condition is
perfectly satisfied since inside the well all the distances are
maximally of order @xmath . We see that approximation ( 3.61 ) is
perfectly satisfied. This also means the validity of the string
hypothesis.

In view of ( 3.61 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the dots stand for the term that can be neglected in the large
@xmath limit.

The equation ( 3.61 ) for @xmath is solved explicitly by ¹⁴ ¹⁴ 14 We
require @xmath to be analytic outside the real axis.

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.63)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Inserting this solution into ( 3.62 ) we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

The factor containing @xmath can be calculated explicitly in the limit (
3.1 ). If we take logarithm and then derivative of this factor we will
get:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (3.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

The overall constant of integration can be found from the fact that at
@xmath the considered factor in the limit ( 3.1 ) should be equal to
@xmath .

Therefore in the limit ( 3.1 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here the product is taken only over the interior holes (inside the well
in Fig. 3.3 ). The residual factor from the exterior holes is @xmath ,
where @xmath is the number of exterior holes to the right from the well.
Since the holes are excited by pairs, the value of the multiplier @xmath
does not depend on the type of excitation we consider. In the following
we will consider the case when @xmath is divisible by @xmath , therefore
@xmath .

The representation ( 3.66 ) for @xmath is correct in the strip @xmath ,
where we can use approximation ( 3.61 ) for both @xmath and @xmath .
From ( 3.57 ) we do not expect singularities on the lines @xmath , at
least inside the well. Therefore let us evaluate l.h.s. of ( 3.58 )
using ( 3.66 ). From this evaluation we see that ( 3.58 ) gives
asymptotic Bethe Ansatz equations for the @xmath GN model:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

A given asymptotic behavior of @xmath functions in the large @xmath
limit is sufficient to solve the @xmath system in the finite volume. It
follows for example from the method developed in [ 87 ] . Since we
reproduce asymptotic Bethe Ansatz in the large volume limit, we
therefore can identify @xmath and @xmath .

Let us now see how the transfer matrices are identified. We expect to
find the gauge transform which will give the following boundary
conditions in the large @xmath limit:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.68)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.69)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

In this gauge @xmath should be of order @xmath and therefore the first
row in the strip were Hirota equations are nontrivial is decoupled.
Therefore ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.69 ) define boundary conditions for the Hirota
system defined on a strip @xmath , see Fig. 3.4 . @xmath is the nested
transfer matrix. The condition of absence of poles of @xmath leads to
the nested Bethe equations of @xmath sigma model.

The gauge transformation which leads to ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.69 ) should
satisfy the following equations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.70)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

There is indeed a solution of such system.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore we see that the Hirota equations for the discretized spin
chain have a meaningful thermodynamic limit if a proper gauge is chosen.

### Chapter 4 Supersymmetric spin chains

The current achievements in the field of supersymmetric integrable
systems can be summarized as follows ¹ ¹ 1 We will restrict to the most
studied case of @xmath algebras. . Most of the algebraic constructions
based on the @xmath algebra have a direct generalization to the
supersymmetric case. However, these generalizations do not cover the all
variety of properties of supersymmetric systems. Also, the physics of
the excitations over the antiferromagnetic vacuum is much more
complicated and was studied to some extent only for few simple cases.

Generalizing @xmath case construction, all finite-dimensional
irreducible representations (irreps) of @xmath algebra were constructed
by Kac [ 88 , 89 ] as highest weight representations. Equivalently these
representations can be labeled by Young tableaux [ 90 , 91 , 92 ] . The
determinant Weyl formula for characters and its parameter dependent
generalization - Bazhanov-Reshetikhin formula [ 93 ] has a
straightforward generalization [ 94 , 95 , 96 ] . This allows, in a
complete analogy with @xmath case, to construct the nested Bethe Ansatz
for a supersymmetric group from Hirota dynamics via a chain of Backlund
transforms [ 40 ] . The Bethe Ansatz equations can be also derived using
analytical Bethe Ansatz techniques [ 97 ] .

What makes the @xmath case more difficult than the @xmath case is that
Lie superalgebras allow also reducible but indecomposable
representations. A good example is the @xmath algebra representations of
which were studied in [ 98 , 99 ] . Although all irreps of @xmath were
classified, the complete classification of indecomposable
representations for arbitrary supersymmetric simple algebra is not known
² ² 2 This is mainly due to the representations of zigzag type. See [
100 ] and references therein. .

Even if we consider only irreducible representations, their tensor
product may contain an indecomposable representation. It is possible to
restrict to the class of the representations tensor product of which is
given by a direct sum of irreps. Unfortunately, such restriction does
not allow construction of a spin chain which contains a singlet state
(antiferromagnetic vacuum). Therefore, whenever an antiferromagnetic
vacuum is present in a spin chain, studying of excitations around this
vacuum encounters the problem of presence of irreducible
representations; this leads to significant complications in the
construction of a physical theory [ 101 , 102 ] .

Here we aim to discuss the techniques mostly for further applications to
the integrable system that appears in the context of the AdS/CFT
correspondence. It turns out that, at least for the purposes of this
text, it is sufficient to consider the class of irreps that do not
contain indecomposable parts in their tensor product. These
representations can be obtained from tensoring of the fundamental
representation.

In this chapter we will first recall basic properties of the
supersymmetric algebras and theirs representations on the example of the
@xmath algebra. Then we will discuss the structure of the
representations that appear as a result of the fusion procedure for the
@xmath case. We will see that, as in the nonsupersymmetric case, the
string-like solutions are in the one-to-one correspondence with
rectangular irreps. The corresponding integral equations will be
naturally written on a fat hook shape.

The integral equations can be written also in the case of the Bethe
Ansatz in the representation of type @xmath . In this case the equations
are naturally written on a so called T-hook shape. This raises a
question about representation theory behind T-hook. This question has
not been solved.

The fusion relations for a fat hook shape were discussed in [ 94 , 95 ,
40 ] . In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence the T-hook shape was
first proposed in [ 44 ] and then in [ 46 , 47 ] built starting from the
string hypothesis of [ 103 , 43 ] . The string hypotheses and TBA
systems for various cases were also known in the literature before [ 104
] .

In Sec. 4.5 we present a general construction: the string hypothesis and
corresponding functional equations for the resolvents ³ ³ 3
Equivalently, we can write integral equations for the density functions.
for @xmath algebra and for Bethe equations with one arbitrary source
term. The Bethe equations may be based on any Kac-Dynkin diagram.
Although this generalization of [ 103 , 104 , 44 ] is quite obvious, it
was not discussed in the literature before.

#### 4.1 @xmath algebra and its representations

The defining representation of the algebra is given by the following
@xmath matrices

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

The generators @xmath of @xmath bosonic subalgebra obey canonical
commutation relations

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

The fermionic generators @xmath and @xmath transform under adjoint
action of @xmath as a spin @xmath representation. Nonzero commutators
are given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The Cartan subalgebra of @xmath is spanned by @xmath and @xmath . The
generator @xmath acts as zero on the bosonic generators. On the
fermionic generators it acts as follows

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Finally, the fermionic commutators ⁴ ⁴ 4 For the case of superalgebras
we understand any commutator as a graded commutator, that is
anticommutator when both generators are fermionic and usual commutator
otherwise. are given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

The weight diagram for the generators is shown in Fig. 4.2 .

A standard method to build an irreducible representation of the @xmath
algebra is to introduce the highest weight vector @xmath defined by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

The other states of the representation are obtained by action of
lowering operators @xmath , and @xmath . Due to the fermionic nature of
@xmath and @xmath , each of these operators is applied consecutively at
most once. For the case when they applied exactly once, we get a typical
representation, which we will denote as @xmath . Under the action of the
bosonic @xmath subalgebra this representation decomposes into four
@xmath irreps: ( @xmath , @xmath ), ( @xmath ), ( @xmath ), ( @xmath ),
where the first argument in the brackets is the spin of the @xmath irrep
and the second argument is the eigenvalue of the operator @xmath . The
dimension of @xmath is the following:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The parameter @xmath can acquire arbitrary values except @xmath .

An atypical representation is the representation for which either @xmath
or @xmath . Due to the commutation relations ( 4.5 ) the first condition
can be realized only for @xmath . The second condition can be realized
only for @xmath . Both conditions are satisfied simultaneously only when
@xmath , i.e. for the trivial representation. We will denote the
atypical representation with @xmath as @xmath and the atypical
representation with @xmath as @xmath . The reason for such notation is
clear from the structure of the representation shown in Fig. 4.2 . The
dimension of atypical representation is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

Since the dimension of atypical representation is smaller than the
dimension of typical representation with the same spin, atypical
representation is often called short representation.

For @xmath we have @xmath . This is nothing but the fundamental
representation.

The structure of reducible but indecomposable representations is quite
involved. Here we would like to point out only the simplest type of
indecomposable representation which can be obtained as continuation of
the typical representation @xmath to the point @xmath (or @xmath ). The
irreducible submodule in such representation is @xmath ( @xmath ). For
more information about indecomposable representations we refer to [ 100
] .

It is useful to identify irreps with the Young tableaux. There are two
3-dimensional representations: @xmath and @xmath . We will refer to the
first one as fundamental ( @xmath ) and to the second one as
antifundamental ( @xmath ). Following [ 91 ] , we label @xmath with a
box and @xmath with a dotted box (see Fig. 4.4 ). In general, to obtain
all irreps one should consider tensor products of @xmath and @xmath . A
general irrep corresponds to a union of two Young tableaux [ 91 ] shown
in Fig. 4.4 . It is tempting to answer the question whether it is
meaningful to fit this union into the T-hook domain that is introduced
in section 4.7 .

An important difference with the @xmath case is that the antifundamental
representation never appears in the tensor product of the fundamental
representation. This is also true for a trivial representation, atypical
representations with negative @xmath and any typical representations
with @xmath . A natural way to construct antiferromagnetic vacuum is to
consider a spin chain with half of the nodes in the fundamental and half
of the nodes in the antifundamental representations [ 101 ] . Since
tensor products of @xmath and @xmath contain also indecomposable
representations, we will encounter such representations when dealing
with the excitations over the antiferromagnetic vacuum.

In the following we will consider a simpler particular case - the
representations with @xmath . These representations can be obtained from
the tensor product of fundamental representation only. Such tensor
product always decomposes into irreps.

To fix grading of the representation module, we take the vector space
with two bosonic and one fermionic components for the fundamental
representation. A straightforward combinatorial analysis gives the
identification of Young tableaux and irreps shown in Fig. 4.4 . We used
inverse notation for Young tableaux with the largest line below. Such
notation was used in [ 40 ] to describe Hirota dynamics in integrable
systems. Horizontal lines in the Young tableaux mean
supersymmetrization: symmetrization of bosonic elements with other
elements and antisymmetrization of fermionic elements. The vertical
lines in the Young tableaux imply superantisymmetrization:
antisymmetrization of bosonic elements with other elements and
symmetrization of fermionic elements. Note that Young tableaux give
typical irreps with only discrete half-integer values of @xmath .

#### 4.2 Fusion procedure in the @xmath case.

The procedure of construction of irreps of @xmath algebra is a
straightforward generalization of such procedure for @xmath case. Again,
we have a fundamental representation defined by Dynkin labels @xmath and
its conjugate. Arbitrary irrep can be obtained only from tensor product
of both of these representations. Appearance of the reducible
indecomposable representations in the tensor product is controlled by
the value of the continuous parameter @xmath . The parameter @xmath is a
Cartan weight with respect to the generator @xmath , where generator
@xmath is given by the following matrix in the defining representation:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the following we consider only the representations that can be
obtained from the tensor product only of the fundamental representation
@xmath itself. Such irreps are described by Young tableaux which should
be inside a fat hook structure shown in Fig. 4.5 . If the border of a
Young table does not touch the internal border ⁵ ⁵ 5 By the internal
border of fat hook we mean the border which contains the corner point
@xmath . of the fat hook then such Young table defines atypical
representation. Otherwise, such Young table defines typical
representation.

We can derive the Hirota dynamics on a fat hook using a straightforward
generalization of discussion in Sec. 1.4 [ 40 ] . Namely, we consider an
integrable system based on the @xmath -matrix

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the graded permutation.

Starting with this @xmath -matrix one can construct the transfer matrix
in a fundamental representation and use a fusion procedure to obtain the
transfer matrices in other representations. The transfer matrices @xmath
in the rectangular irrep satisfy the Hirota equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

The transfer matrices are non-zero if @xmath or @xmath is inside or on
the border of the shape (fat hook) in Fig. 4.5 .

The representations are nontrivial on the internal border of the fat
hook. They are different from the representation in the corner @xmath
only by the value of the parameter @xmath .

#### 4.3 Bethe Ansatz

The Bethe Ansatz equations can be derived from the fusion relations (
4.11 ) via a chain composed from two different types of Backlund
transforms. The two different types of Backlund transforms appear in the
following way. The bilinear equations ( 1.5 ) on @xmath and @xmath
considered for a fat hook configuration allow two solutions. For the
first one @xmath is nonzero on a fat hook @xmath . This is the same
Backlund transform which was discussed in section 1.5 . It is called the
Backlund transform of the first type (BT1).

For the second solution @xmath is nonzero on a fat hook @xmath .
Exchanging the roles of @xmath and @xmath for such Backlund transform we
obtain the Backlund transform of the second type (BT2) which reduces
@xmath by one. The functional equations for BT2 are shown in Fig. 4.5 .

The set of the Bethe Ansatz equations is obtained after successive
application of Backlund transforms that reduce the fat hook to a single
strip. This can be done by application of different chains of Backlund
transforms [ 40 ] . A possible chain is shown in Fig. 4.5 . The shape of
the chain corresponds to a particular Kac-Dynkin diagram of the @xmath
algebra. Each turning of the path corresponds to the fermionic node.
Each straight pass corresponds to the bosonic node.

The Bethe Ansatz equations are determined by the Cartan matrix of a
given Kac-Dynkin diagram and have the formal expression

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Cartan matrix @xmath for a given Kac-Dynkin diagram up to an overall
sign is given by the following identification:

The overall sign is chosen such that the sum of the elements in the
first row of @xmath is positive.

For example, the Cartan matrix for the Kac-Dynkin diagram in Fig. 4.5 is
the following:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Bethe equations ( 4.12 ) can be also written for an arbitrary
representation [ 97 ] . It is not clear how to obtain the Bethe
equations for an arbitrary representation from a fat hook construction.

#### 4.4 Duality transformations.

The system of the Bethe equations is different depending on what
underlying Kac-Dynkin diagram was chosen. But the physical properties of
the system should not depend on the choice of the Kac-Dynkin diagram.
And indeed, there exists a so called duality transformation [ 105 , 106
] , [ 95 ] , [ 107 ] which allows to pass from one system of equations
to another.

Let us consider a fermionic node. We will denote the Baxter polynomial
for this node as @xmath . The fermionic node is coupled to two other
nodes. We will denote the Baxter polynomials that correspond to these
nodes as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Bethe equation for the fermionic node

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

can be derived from the Baxter equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

From the point of view of a fat hook picture the Baxter polynomials
@xmath are just some @xmath polynomials ⁶ ⁶ 6 @xmath is the polynomial
that defines a boundary condition for the @xmath fat hook. This is a
generalization of the @xmath polynomial in Sec. 1.5 . The polynomial
@xmath gives a source term for the Bethe equations. For the homogeneous
spin chain of length @xmath we have @xmath . with appropriate shifts of
the arguments on @xmath . These polynomials are associated to the nodes
which form a square shown in Fig. 4.6 . The Baxter equation ( 4.15 ) is
a @xmath relation on these polynomials.

Duality transformation is a passage from the Bethe equations which
contain @xmath as Bethe roots to the Bethe equations which contain
@xmath (zeroes of @xmath ) as Bethe roots. We see that @xmath and @xmath
enter ( 4.15 ) in a symmetric way. Therefore @xmath are also fermionic
roots. They obey the same equation as ( 4.14 ), with @xmath replaced by
@xmath .

The roots @xmath enter to the Bethe equations for @xmath as the
following ratio

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

An analogous ratio appears in the Bethe equations for @xmath .

Using ( 4.15 ) it is easy to see that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore the Bethe equations for @xmath ( @xmath ) change under duality
transformations in accordance with the change of the Kac-Dynkin diagram
shown in Fig. 4.6 .

Let us also consider Bethe equations which correspond to the
representation
@xmath . Such Bethe equations are written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

A special attention should be devoted to the momentum carrying node in
these equations if @xmath . If the momentum carrying node is fermionic,
the Bethe equations for this node are written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

If we perform a duality transformation for the momentum carrying node
then the building block of the Bethe equations for @xmath roots will be
the following:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore the @xmath node becomes also momentum carrying. Although the
duality transformation of the momentum-carrying node is possible, the
resulting equations bring the Bethe Ansatz equations in a nonstandard
form. Due to this we should forbid to perform the duality transformation
of the momentum-carrying node if it is situated inside the Kac-Dynkin
diagram. This restriction has interesting consequences. For example, if
each wing (on the left and on the right from the momentum-carrying node)
of the Kac-Dynkin diagram contains at least one fermionic node, one
cannot rewrite the Bethe equations in a form which corresponds to the
distinguished diagram (the one with a single fermionic node).

The momentum-carrying node has another important feature. If we start
from the Bethe equations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

which correspond to the left diagram in Fig. 4.7 , and perform duality
transform both on @xmath and @xmath nodes, then the Bethe equations for
the momentum carrying node will become

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

If we put @xmath and @xmath in equation ( 4.21 ) then we will get the
equation for a compact (SU(2)) XXX spin chain. On the opposite, if we
put @xmath and @xmath in ( 4.22 ) then we will get the equation for a
noncompact (Sl(2)) XXX spin chain.

The second description reveals noncompactness of the spin chain
described by ( 4.18 ). Indeed, let us find the constraints on the
possible number of the Bethe roots. For simplicity we suppose that there
are only three types of the Bethe roots. Bosonic Bethe roots @xmath
which satisfy ( 4.21 ) (or, equivalently ( 4.22 )) and fermionic Bethe
roots @xmath which satisfy the Baxter equations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

From the Baxter equation we read that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

In Sec. 1.3 we obtained the constraints on the number of bosonic Bethe
roots. In our case we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

Combining ( 4.24 ) and ( 4.25 ) we see that the number of the Bethe
roots is unconstrained.

#### 4.5 String hypothesis and integral equations

To formulate a set of integral equations in the thermodynamic limit we
will establish first the string hypothesis for the Bethe Ansatz based on
the @xmath algebra.

The string hypothesis for bosonic roots was discussed in Sec. 1.3 and in
Sec. 2.3 . Bosonic Bethe roots can form string configurations alone.
Also they can participate in the formation of stacks as intermediate
nodes. The mechanism how the bosonic roots enter the stacks was
discussed in Sec. 2.3 in the context of GN and PCF models.

To formulate a string hypothesis for fermionic roots we will consider
the Baxter equation for fermionic roots

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the notation is the same as for ( 4.15 ).

Let us assume for simplicity the following ordering of Bethe roots:
@xmath . Then in the thermodynamic limit the roots of @xmath type will
determine the dominant term in the l.h.s. of ( 4.26 ). For @xmath the
first term will be dominant.

Fermionic Bethe roots do not form string configurations themselves.
Instead, they participate in the formation of stacks as the first or the
final node. Indeed, if @xmath -roots organize in a string of length
@xmath then ( 4.26 ) implies the string configuration with the same
center either for @xmath -roots of length @xmath , or for @xmath -roots
of length @xmath .

All possible string/stack configurations that can be built from bosonic
and fermionic nodes ⁷ ⁷ 7 For the rational Bethe Ansatz in any
fundamental representation. are shown in Fig. 4.8

###### Integral equations on a fat hook

The procedure of construction of integral equations is analogous to the
one described for the bosonic case. In appendix B we prove the following
statement:

The set of the functional equations derived from the Bethe Ansatz for a
given Kac-Dynkin diagram of @xmath algebra and under the assumption that
the string hypothesis is valid is equivalent to the following set of
equations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

for @xmath being a coordinate of a point situated strictly inside the
fat hook, and, for @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is different for different Kac-Dynkin diagrams; the
expression for of @xmath is given in ( B.10 ) and ( B.11 ).

@xmath is a ”D-deformed” Cartan matrix defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

The resolvents @xmath and @xmath are zero on the boundary and outside
the fat hook except for @xmath .

There is a string configuration associated with each @xmath node of a
fat hook. Depending on the node, either @xmath or @xmath is the
resolvent of the density function of strings. Then correspondingly
either @xmath or @xmath is the resolvent of the correspondent density of
holes.

The exact identification of @xmath with holes or particles is given by
the following procedure. First we draw the Kac-Dynkin diagram on the
nodes of the fat hook. The momentum-carrying node corresponds to the
node {1,1}. We are allowed then to move only to the east or to the
north. The initial direction is to the east(north) if the last movement
in the chain of the Backlund transforms was to the west(south). For
example for the fat hook construction in Fig. 4.5 the initial direction
is to the north.

One should turn at each node next to the fermionic one.

Each node of the fat hook occupied by the Kac-Dynkin diagram is
associated with the corresponding type of the Bethe roots. The
string/stack configurations with the longest string formed from this
type of Bethe roots are situated on the straight line which starts from
the considered node. There is the only way to assign straight lines to
the nodes of the Kac-Dynkin diagram such that all nodes of the fat hook
will be occupied.

The example of the whole construction is shown in Fig. 4.9 .

The correspondence between holes/particles and @xmath is chosen in such
a way that interaction (in the sense of equation ( 4.27 )) inside the
same line should be through the holes and the interaction between
different lines should be through the particles.

Although formally the equations ( 4.27 ) are the same for different
Kac-Dynkin diagrams, these equations describe different regimes of a
spin chain. As well, in general there is no relations between the
resolvents used in ( 4.27 ) for different Kac-Dynkin diagrams. We will
illustrate now this issue on the example of @xmath spin chain

#### 4.6 Thermodynamic limit of the Bethe equations in the @xmath case

In the @xmath case we can consider the thermodynamic limit for
configurations close either to the ferromagnetic or to the
antiferromagnetic vacuum. In the supersymmetric case there are more
possibilities.

Let us consider the Bethe equations for @xmath spin chain in a
fundamental representation. Each site of the spin chain is occupied by
one particle which can be a boson with spin up or down or a fermion.

From the representation theory we conclude that the total number of
fermions can be changed only by @xmath by the action of the symmetry
algebra. Indeed, the number of fermions is changed under action of
@xmath and @xmath generators. The square of these generators is zero.

Therefore the state with large amount of fermions never lies in the same
symmetry multiplet with the state with small amount of fermions. Thus we
have four possible regimes in the thermodynamic limit. If we choose as
the pseudovacuum a state with each site occupied with bosons with spin
down then these regimes are described as follows:

1.  Large spin, small amount of fermions.

2.  Small spin, small amount of fermions.

3.  Large spin, large amount of fermions.

4.  Small spin, large amount of fermions.

These regimes can be shown on the following weight diagram:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

It turns out that different types of the thermodynamic limit, except the
second one, are naturally related to different dual configurations of
the Bethe equations. We will consider each configuration separately.

######

case. In this case the Bethe equations are written as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.31)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The inequalities for the number of Bethe roots are written as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

Naturally, the thermodynamic limit is possible in the case when we
replace all inequalities @xmath by stronger demands @xmath . This
corresponds to the first type of the thermodynamic limit.

The bosonic Bethe roots @xmath can form string configurations while the
fermionic roots are real. Introducing the resolvents @xmath for the
@xmath -strings and @xmath for fermions we obtain the integral equations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.33)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

One can try to perform a particle-hole transformation of @xmath as we
did in the @xmath case. In this way we will realize the second type of
the limit. The obtained integral equations seem do not correspond to the
asymptotic Bethe Ansatz of any known integrable field theory.

######

[]

case. This case is obtained from the previous one by performing the
dualization of the root @xmath . The Bethe equations are written as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.34)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The inequalities for number of Bethe roots are written as follows

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

The thermodynamic limit corresponds to the case when @xmath , which is a
third type of thermodynamic limit.

Since the resolvents @xmath remain the same as in the previous case, all
the integral equations which do not include @xmath should remain the
same. This is indeed the case. Note that the underlying @xmath -string
configurations in the [] case correspond to stack configurations of two
fermionic nodes in the [] case.

The complete set of integral equations is written as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.36)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where by @xmath we denoted the resolvent for dual variables and by
@xmath the resolvent of holes for the dual variables. Note that by
construction @xmath .

######

[]

case. This case is obtained after duality transformation on the @xmath
-variable of the [] case. The Bethe equations are written as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.37)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

This case is the best suited for description of the low-spin regime with
most of the excitations being fermions (case 4). The @xmath -string of
@xmath -s in the [] case transforms into @xmath string of @xmath -s in
the [] case. The bosonic excitations of the [] case are now described by
the stack composed of @xmath 2-string and one @xmath Bethe root. We will
denote the resolvent of @xmath -string configuration, @xmath , by @xmath
(it should be the same resolvents as in previous case), the resolvent
for free @xmath roots by @xmath , and the resolvent for the stack by
@xmath . Then the integral equations will be written as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.38)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

#### 4.7 T-hook

In the previous two chapters we discussed an algebraic structure of the
functional equations for the case of the irrep @xmath of the @xmath
algebra. This structure has a natural generalization for the case of
other fundamental representation. Let us consider an integrable system
which is described by the following Kac-Dynkin diagram:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is a diagram of the @xmath algebra ⁸ ⁸ 8 If a grading convention is
not specified, it could be also a @xmath algebra. However, we can always
define a self-consistent notation to obtain only @xmath case. . Gray
nodes stay either for bosonic or fermionic nodes. Therefore we do not
require the Kac-Dynkin diagram to be distinguished. Numbers above the
nodes are the Dynkin labels of the representation.

By a direct generalization of the results of Sec. 4.5 we deduce that the
interactions between string configurations in the thermodynamic limit of
the Bethe Ansatz based on ( 4.39 ) are described by ( 4.27 ) which is
now defined on a T-hook shape shown in Fig. 4.11 . The nodes @xmath
correspond to string or stack configurations based on the momentum
carrying node. The nodes to the right(left) of the central line @xmath
denote string or stack configurations constructed from the Bethe roots
that correspond to the Dynkin nodes to the right(left) of the momentum
carrying node.

Based on the functional equations ( 4.27 ), a @xmath -system defined on
the T-hook shape can be derived from the TBA. This is how a T-hook was
initially proposed in [ 44 , 46 , 47 ] for @xmath .

In the case of the @xmath algebra and of the representation @xmath of
the @xmath algebra there is a strange coincidence that the fusion
relations for the transfer matrices of these system are defined exactly
on the same shape as the @xmath -system following from TBA. Based on
this coincidence we even suggested in section 3.5 an equivalence between
@xmath -functions and transfer matrices of the spin chain
discretization. It is therefore natural to ask a question whether a
T-hook shape has a transfer matrix interpretation.

Unfortunately such kind of interpretation is not known in the
literature. Probably one of the obstacles is that consideration of
fusing relations that include representation of type @xmath leads to
indecomposable representations and therefore is complicated. Still, in a
lack of the transfer matrix description we can ask the question whether
T-hook @xmath -system can be solved by the Bethe Ansatz equations, in
the same fashion as was discussed in sections 1.5 and 4.3 . Such kind of
analysis was partially done in [ 108 ] . In this work indeed a solution
of @xmath -system was given in terms of the boundary @xmath -functions.
If to assume that @xmath are polynomials, they can be considered as the
Baxter polynomials that define positions of the Bethe roots. In [ 108 ]
however only the set of @xmath relations which leads to the Bethe
equations on the fermionic Bethe roots was given. @xmath relations which
lead to the bosonic Bethe equations were not given. It would be
interesting to find such kind of relations. If it is possible then it
would be natural to ask what is the meaning of @xmath -functions from
the point of view of the Bethe Ansatz. This should be a nontrivial
question in view of the complicated representation theory of
superalgebras.

## Part II Integrable system of AdS/CFT

### Chapter 5 Overview

In this chapter we are going to review the subject of integrability in
the AdS/CFT correspondence. For other reviews on this subject we refer
to [ 109 , 110 , 111 , 112 ] (correspondence itself), [ 113 , 114 , 115
] (integrability, with the stress on the gauge side), [ 116 , 117 , 118
, 119 ] (integrability, with the stress on the string side), [ 120 , 121
, 122 ] (both aspects). In this text we do not discuss scattering
amplitudes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. For reviews of
this subject we refer to [ 123 , 124 ] .

#### 5.1 Essentials of the AdS/CFT correspondence.

String theory initially appeared as an attempt to describe strong
interactions. However, this attempt was not very successful and with the
discovery of nonabelian gauge theories it receded into the background. A
new relation of strings, now to the gauge theory, was proposed by ’t
Hooft [ 125 ] . In his work he considered the large @xmath limit of
@xmath gauge theories:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

In this limit the sum of Feynman diagrams can be organized as the @xmath
expansion. Interestingly, this expansion is nothing but the expansion
over the topologies. For example, the partition function of the system
is expanded as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a sum of Feynman diagrams which can be drawn on a
Riemann surface with @xmath handles.

The topological expansion is reminiscent to the perturbative expansion
in a string theory. In this analogy we interpret the Feynman diagram
(more precisely, the dual graph) as the discretization of a string
worldsheet and @xmath should be then proportional to the string coupling
@xmath .

The idea to interpret Feynman diagrams as a discretization of the
two-dimensional surface was fruitfully used to define the
two-dimensional gravity through the matrix models [ 126 , 127 , 128 ,
129 ] (for a review see [ 130 ] ). In the case of the matrix models the
sum over the planar graphs @xmath can be calculated explicitly. This sum
is convergent with a finite radius of convergence @xmath . Close to a
critical value @xmath the sum is dominated by the diagrams with large
number of vertices. Therefore the continuous surfaces are recovered in
the proper double scaling limit which includes @xmath .

The identification of the string theory which corresponds to a ’t Hooft
construction in the gauge theories is a highly nontrivial problem. For a
long time there were no explicit examples except the ones for the
two-dimensional gauge theories [ 131 , 132 , 133 ] . The discovery of
the AdS/CFT correspondence [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] gave us explicit examples of a
gauge/string duality in four dimensions. Often it is suggested that this
duality realizes the ’t Hooft idea, however this was not explicitly
shown.

The first example of the AdS/CFT correspondence is the equivalence
between @xmath supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM) and the type IIB
string theory with AdS @xmath S @xmath manifold as a target space. This
equivalence was first proposed in [ 2 ] developing the study of string
theories in the presence of @xmath -branes.

The @xmath -branes are @xmath dimensional objects on which strings can
terminate [ 134 ] ( @xmath stands for Dirichlet boundary conditions).
The low-energy modes of the @xmath -branes are described by the
maximally supersymmetric gauge theory living on @xmath -brane. A stack
of @xmath branes leads to the @xmath gauge theory [ 135 ] . For @xmath
this is @xmath SYM. This is how SYM theory appears in the context of the
string theory.

The AdS/CFT conjecture is based on the observation that string theory in
the presence of @xmath -branes can be effectively described, at least
when @xmath is large, as a closed string theory in a nontrivial
gravitational background. We will now explain this description in more
details. Let us consider a type IIB string theory. Its action is the
action for the supersymmetric sigma model, with a worldsheet metric
being dynamic. The bosonic part of the action can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a target space metric, @xmath is an antisymmetric tensor
and @xmath is the dilaton.

@xmath can be considered as an infinite set of coupling constants in the
quantum field theory which are subjects of renormalization. This is how
strings govern the geometry of the target space. The demand that the
@xmath -function for these coupling constants equals zero leads to the
supergravity equations of motion.

The type IIB string theory contains also the selfdual 4-form @xmath .
There exists a solution of supergravity EOM with a flux of a field
strength @xmath equal to @xmath , @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.4)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

This is a background which is suggested to be effectively generated by a
stack of @xmath @xmath -branes.

Due to the red shift the energies for the observer at infinity are not
the same as the energies for the observer at finite @xmath . They are
related as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

One can consider the following limit introduced by Maldacena [ 2 ] . We
take @xmath with @xmath fixed. In this limit the near horizon dynamics
at distances @xmath decouples from the rest. In terms of the variable
@xmath the near horizon geometry is approximated by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is the AdS @xmath S @xmath geometry. Therefore we obtain the type
IIB strings propagating in the AdS @xmath S @xmath space-time.

Due to ( 5.5 ), the near horizon excitations are viewed by the observer
at infinity as low energy excitations. As we already discussed, the low
energy excitations are described in a @xmath -brane picture by the gauge
theory.

The comparison of these two different descriptions of the near horizon
physics leads to the AdS/CFT correspondence conjecture. The conjecture
includes also the relation between @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

From ( 5.6 ) and ( 5.3 ) we conclude that the string sigma model depends
not on @xmath and @xmath separately but on their dimensionless ratio
which is a ’t Hooft coupling constant:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

The AdS/CFT correspondence is often trusted only in the ’t Hooft limit (
5.1 ), when the stack of @xmath -branes is a heavy object capable to
generate a nontrivial gravity background. In the ’t Hooft limit @xmath ,
so the first quantization of the string theory is enough. This is the
limit which we consider in this text.

The discussed construction of the duality picture can be generalized.
The possible variations of the string target spaces and brane
configurations are discussed in a great detail in the review [ 111 ] .

Recently an AdS @xmath /CFT @xmath version of the duality was proposed
by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis, and Maldacena (ABJM) [ 136 ] . The ABJM
conjecture relates @xmath @xmath superconformal Chern-Simons theory at
level @xmath with M-theory on AdS @xmath S @xmath . The quotient with
respect to @xmath should be understood in the following way: S @xmath
can be viewed as the S @xmath Hopf bundle over @xmath . The discrete
group @xmath acts on the S @xmath fiber. For @xmath it breaks the
complete @xmath supersymmetry to @xmath one. In the ’t Hooft limit (
@xmath with @xmath fixed) the dimension reduction from S @xmath to
@xmath takes place and we obtain the correspondence between the planar
Chern-Simons gauge theory and the first quantized type IIA string theory
on AdS @xmath .

Since in the limit ( 5.1 ) the duality is of weak/strong coupling type,
it is especially useful for the description of the gauge theories at
strong coupling. It would be very interesting to find a
non-supersymmetric version of the duality which could describe QCD. Of
course it is not obvious whether such generalization is possible at all.
For a discussion of possible restrictions for this generalization and to
what extent they can be overcome see [ 137 ] .

Let us come back to the ’t Hooft attempt to describe the worldsheet
discretization of a string with the help of Feynman diagrams. If to
follow the analogy with matrix models, the continuous description of the
worldsheet appears when the coupling constant approach some critical
value @xmath . The finiteness of @xmath for @xmath SYM ¹ ¹ 1 or other
gauge theory conjectured by the duality. would signal that the ’t Hooft
description is inappropriate for the AdS/CFT correspondence. In the
presence of the supersymmetry one could believe that by virtue of some
cancellations @xmath . However, the finite radius of convergence for
small ’t Hooft coupling expansion of various observables in @xmath SYM
suggests that @xmath is finite.

A huge progress in the understanding of the AdS/CFT correspondence
during the last decade was possible in particular due to the discovery
of integrability. It is believed that integrability will allow to find
the spectrum of the AdS/CFT system at arbitrary value of the coupling
constant and to give a direct proof of the duality. On the string side
the integrability appears in a standard way - as integrability of a
coset sigma model. On the gauge side the integrability structures are
identified in quite unusual way. We will now discuss the integrability
structures from the gauge point of view, then pass to the string side,
and at the end review the main tests of the AdS/CFT correspondence and
the integrability conjecture.

#### 5.2 Gauge side of the correspondence and underlying integrable
system.

The gauge side of the AdS/CFT correspondence is the @xmath super
Yang-Mills (SYM) theory in @xmath dimensions. This is a conformal field
theory. The vanishing of the beta function in it was shown in [ 138 ,
139 , 140 ] . The field content of @xmath SYM is a gauge field, four
left and four right Majorana spinors, and 6 real scalars:

  -- -------- -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      (5.9)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- -------

All fields are in the adjoint representation of the @xmath gauge group.

The global symmetry algebra of the system is @xmath . The bosonic
subalgebra of @xmath is given by the direct sum @xmath . Its first term
is the conformal symmetry in @xmath dimensions, the second term is the
@xmath symmetry. The @xmath symmetry trivially acts on @xmath , spinors
transform in its spinorial representation ( @xmath acts on the index
@xmath ), scalars transform in its vector representation ( @xmath acts
on the index @xmath ).

The lagrangian of the theory is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.10)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The coefficients @xmath are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients which
provide the invariance of the lagrangian under action of the @xmath
symmetry.

We are interested in the ’t Hooft planar limit ( 5.1 ) of the theory.
Instead of the ’t Hooft coupling constant @xmath the coupling constant
@xmath is often used. It is defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

The objects to study in the planar limit are single trace local
operators. These operators can be viewed as the words built from the
letters corresponding to the elementary fields of the theory. A possible
example of such operator is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

Single trace operators ( 5.12 ) are organized into multiplets of the
symmetry algebra @xmath . Its representations are parameterized by a set
of numbers

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are spin labels of the representation of the Lorentz group
@xmath , @xmath are Dynkin labels of @xmath and @xmath is the conformal
dimension or, what is the same, the eigenvalue of the dilatation
operator. We will denote the dilatation operator by @xmath .

The symmetry algebra is preserved on the quantum level. However, certain
symmetry generators depend on the coupling constant due to their
renormalization.

The unitary representations of @xmath were classified in [ 141 , 142 ] .
They include three series of the so called BPS representations. These
representations are analogs of atypical irreps discussed in Sec. 4.1 .
The value of @xmath in the BPS multiplets can acquire only half-integer
or integer values, therefore it does not change on the quantum level.

There is also one series of irreps for which the value of @xmath can
change continuously. For these irreps the dilatation operator acquires
in general situation a quantum correction:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

The quantum correction to the dilatation operator @xmath , unlike the
classical part @xmath , acts nondiagonally on the single trace local
operators:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

According to the duality conjecture the eigenvector of @xmath
corresponds to a certain string state. The corresponding eigenvalue
(anomalous dimension of the operator) is equal to the energy of this
state. Finding the spectrum of @xmath is the subject on which we
concentrate in this thesis.

If we are interested in finding the spectrum of very long operators, the
diagonalization of the matrix @xmath seems to be a complicated problem
since this matrix is very large. For short operators a direct
diagonalization is possible, however @xmath is known explicitly only at
first few orders of small @xmath expansion. The integrability methods
turned out to be a very powerful tool which allowed to overcome these
problems. We will explain how integrability appears in the spectral
problem of AdS/CFT and then discuss it in details. To start, we should
first explain some details on the structure of the single trace
operators and operator @xmath .

One can think about a single trace operator as being a state of a spin
chain. Each occurrence of a given field (but not covariant derivative)
corresponds to one site of this chain with the corresponding color
index.

As an example we can consider the operator which consists of the fields
only of two types, @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

The vector space spanned by these operators is invariant under action of
the quantum dilatation operator. @xmath and @xmath form a fundamental
multiplet of the @xmath subalgebra of @xmath . Therefore the space
spanned by operators ( 5.16 ) is usually called the @xmath subsector.
The mapping to the spin chain is the following: we identify @xmath field
with a spin down @xmath state of the node and @xmath field with a spin
up @xmath state of the node, so the operator ( 5.16 ) is mapped to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Another important example is the operators built only from the @xmath
field and a light-cone covariant derivative @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

Such operators are called twist @xmath spin @xmath operators, where
@xmath is a number of @xmath -fields and @xmath is a number of covariant
derivatives.

This subsector is also invariant under the action of the dilatation
operator and is called the @xmath subsector. Here @xmath is identified
with a node of the spin chain and the number of covariant derivatives
acting on @xmath gives a number of excitations at that particular node.
This subsector is noncompact in the sense that the number of excitations
at each node can be arbitrary.

Although the symmetry generators @xmath are renormalized, their
conformal dimensions are preserved since the commutation relations are
preserved. In other words, @xmath commutes with symmetry generators:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore, if one thinks of @xmath as of the Hamiltonian of the
described above spin chain, @xmath is the symmetry of this spin chain.

Note that @xmath enters as a central extension of @xmath algebra which
is different from for example such spin chain as Heisenberg ferromagnet.
Instead, this property resembles to the case of relativistic theories in
the sense that in both cases the Hamiltonian is a part of a symmetry
algebra.

The Hamiltonian @xmath can be expanded in the powers of the coupling
constant as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the @xmath -loop contribution of the perturbative
theory. The perturbation theory in the ’t Hooft planar limit is such
that @xmath includes only the interactions between @xmath nearest
neighbors. For example, for the @xmath subsector @xmath and @xmath are
given by [ 6 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a permutation operator.

The integrability in @xmath SYM was first observed by Minahan and
Zarembo in [ 5 ] for the @xmath subsector of the spin chain at one loop
² ² 2 Prior to this work, integrability had been already discovered in
one loop QCD. It first appeared in a study of the Regge asymptotics of
scattering amplitudes [ 143 , 144 ] . The one-loop dilatation operator
in the @xmath subsector of QCD was identified with the Hamiltonian of
integrable spin chain in [ 145 ] . The @xmath subsector then was further
studied in [ 146 , 147 , 148 , 149 ] . This subsector is built only from
the scalar operators @xmath and is invariant under action of @xmath .
Minahan and Zarembo explicitly calculated @xmath in this sector and
found that it was the Hamiltonian of the integrable @xmath spin chain
with rational @xmath -matrix.

In [ 150 ] the one-loop integrability for the whole symmetry algebra was
checked. The underlying integrable spin chain is based on the rational
@xmath @xmath -matrix. Therefore it can be solved by standard means
described in details in the first part of this text. In particular, we
have to choose a pseudovacuum to write down the Bethe Ansatz equations.
The standard choice for the pseudovacuum is the BPS state

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

The pseudovacuum is not invariant under the whole @xmath symmetry, but
only under @xmath . The Bethe Ansatz equations for the excitations over
this pseudovacuum are encoded into the Kac-Dynkin diagram ³ ³ 3 A
particular choice of a Kac-Dynkin diagram is dictated by further
generalization of integrability to higher loops. shown in Fig. 5.1 .

The first evidence that integrability might hold below one loop was
obtained by Beisert, Kristjansen, and Staudacher in [ 6 ] , where the
two loop dilatation operator ( @xmath ) was calculated and a degeneracy
of the spectrum characteristic for integrable system was found. In this
work they conjectured also that integrability holds at all loops. In [
151 ] Beisert showed that the dilatation operator, at least in @xmath
subsector, can be fixed up to three loops by supersymmetry, an input
from perturbative field theory, and additional requirement - the proper
BMN scaling [ 152 , 153 , 10 ] . This gave a check of integrability up
to three loops. The three loop Hamiltonian was shown to be related to
the Inozemtsev model [ 154 ] and derivable from the Hubbard spin chain [
155 ] .

Such properties as the BMN scaling of the spectrum and the relation of
the Hamiltonian to Inozemtsev and Hubbard models, do not hold starting
from four loops. Starting from this order, the checks of integrability
are more sophisticated. So far there is no proof of the all-loop
integrability conjecture, however there are nontrivial checks at four [
21 , 23 , 156 ] , [ 157 , 158 ] and even at five loops [ 159 , 160 , 161
] ⁴ ⁴ 4 The four loop tests [ 157 , 158 ] and five loop tests consider
short operators which are sensible to wrapping corrections. These are
the verifications of the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz which is next level
after construction of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz that we discuss in
this chapter. . Of course, an important argument for the all-loop
integrability is that at strong coupling we should reproduce the string
sigma model, which is integrable at least classically (we discuss the
integrability on the string side of the correspondence in the next
section).

The identification of integrability structures at higher loops is a
nontrivial procedure. As we have already mentioned, the range of
interaction increases by one with each order of the perturbation theory.
Soon the structure of the Hamiltonian becomes very involved. The exact
Hamiltonian of the system is not known ⁵ ⁵ 5 For the @xmath subsector a
construction that allows one to generate the series of @xmath in @xmath
was proposed [ 162 , 163 ] . Still, this construction does not give the
Hamiltonian in a close form. Also it does not include wrapping
interactions. . Also we do not know the complete @xmath -matrix of the
system.

For the finite length spin chain at a certain order of the perturbation
theory the range of interaction spreads to the whole spin chain. At this
order new types of Feynman diagrams appear that contribute to the
Hamiltonian. They lead to the so called wrapping interactions. In [ 164
] it was shown that the Bethe Ansatz approach, at least in the known
form, does not correctly describe the system with wrapping interactions.
Therefore, to apply Bethe Ansatz one should generically restrict to the
case of the infinitely long spin chain. More precisely, for the spin
chain of the length @xmath , the Bethe Ansatz can be trusted up to the
order @xmath in the expansion ( 5.20 ). Due to this reason the Bethe
Ansatz is called asymptotic.

This is reminiscent to the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz in the integrable
sigma-models. The latter is built based on the factorized @xmath -matrix
which describes the scattering of particles. The notion of a scattering
is possible only in the case when @xmath , where @xmath is the mass of
the particle and @xmath is the size of the system. For @xmath or smaller
the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz should be corrected.

The scattering matrix in integrable sigma-models is constructed by the
bootstrap approach discussed in Sec. 2.2 . This approach turned out to
be very useful to describe the spectrum of @xmath . The importance of
the factorized @xmath matrix in the AdS/CFT case was recognized by
Staudacher in [ 8 ] . As was shown by Beisert [ 165 ] , the @xmath
-matrix which describes the scattering over the BPS vacuum ( 5.22 ) can
be fixed up to an overall scalar factor from the symmetry requirements.
The overall scalar factor is restricted by the crossing equations [ 16 ]
⁶ ⁶ 6 The existence of the crossing equations is expected from the fact
that the integrable system should describe also the string sigma model
(see Sec. 6.3 ). . The solution of the crossing equations is also known
[ 20 , 21 ] . This solution is uniquely fixed by the reasonable physical
requirements [ V3 ] .

The knowledge of the @xmath -matrix allows to build the all-loop Bethe
Ansatz equations [ 9 , 166 ] initially proposed by Beisert and
Staudacher [ 11 ] . The @xmath -matrix is not a rational one, except for
@xmath where we recover the one-loop integrable system. The overall
scalar factor, the logarithm of which is also known as the dressing
phase, enters to the central node equations.

The construction of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz will be discussed in
details in chapter 6 . To give a brief idea of how it looks like we
write down an explicit form of the Bethe Ansatz for the @xmath
subsector:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here @xmath is the Zhukovsky map defined by ( 6.34 ) and @xmath is the
dressing factor. For @xmath we have @xmath and @xmath . Therefore we
recover the Bethe Ansatz equations for the XXX Heisenberg ferromagnet (
3.1 ). The Bethe Ansatz equations in the absence of the dressing factor
were first proposed by Beisert, Dippel and Staudacher [ 167 ] and are
known as the BDS Bethe Ansatz. The necessity of the nontrivial dressing
factor became clear from the perturbative calculations on the string
theory side [ 17 ] .

The logic of construction and the structure of all-loop Bethe equations
are much closer to the integrable field theories then to the integrable
spin chains. Therefore, we depict the Dynkin diagram for the all-loop
Bethe Ansatz as shown in Fig. 5.2 ⁷ ⁷ 7 ( 5.23 ) corresponds to the
black node of the diagram in Fig. 5.2 with nested Bethe roots being
turned off. , in analogy with Fig. 2.5 for PCF. This analogy should not
be very surprising since at strong coupling the Bethe Ansatz should
reproduce the spectrum of the string theory, which is a two-dimensional
field theory.

#### 5.3 String side of the correspondence

The first-quantized string is described by a
Green-Schwarz-Metsaev-Tseytlin action [ 12 ] , whose bosonic part has a
nonlinear sigma model form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

The metric @xmath is the metric of AdS @xmath S @xmath ( 5.6 ). The
target space is not AdS @xmath S @xmath but its universal covering. As
we already mentioned, the theory depends on the unique parameter - ’t
Hooft coupling constant given by @xmath , where @xmath is the radius of
@xmath and @xmath spaces.

This theory can be formulated as a coset sigma model. Similarly to
bosonic sigma models on a coset manifold [ 168 ] , it can be shown to be
classically integrable [ 13 ] . Namely, it is possible to construct the
flat current @xmath in terms of which the equations of motion are
written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the simplest cases @xmath . For the string sigma model its definition
is slightly more complicated.

One can introduce the Lax connection @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is flat as it can be easily checked from ( 5.25 ) and the flatness
of @xmath .

Using the Lax connection, one can build the monodromy @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the contour @xmath is a closed contour on the string worldsheet
shown in figure on the right.

Due to the flatness of @xmath the function @xmath does not change if the
contour @xmath is continuously deformed, including translation in the
@xmath direction. Therefore @xmath does not depend on time @xmath .
Since @xmath depends on the additional parameter @xmath it generates an
infinite set of integrals of motion. As usual for integrable systems,
the local integrals of motion appear if to expand @xmath near its
singular points which are @xmath (compare to the formula ( 1.35 ) and
the discussion after it).

For the AdS/CFT sigma model this construction was first realized in [ 13
] . However, the existence of infinite set of integrals of motion is not
sufficient for proving classical integrability. One has to show that
these integrals of motion are in convolution. This was done first for
the @xmath subsector in [ 169 ] , then for the bosonic string in [ 170 ,
171 ] , and finally for the whole string in [ 172 ] .

Each string state is characterized, not uniquely in general, by the
values of the Cartan generators of @xmath algebra acting on it. These
are three angular momenta @xmath for the rotation of string in @xmath ,
two angular momenta @xmath for the rotation of string in @xmath and the
energy @xmath which corresponds to the translations in time direction.
These parameters are related to the parameters ( 5.13 ) which define the
representation in the following way:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

Initial interest for particular solutions to the string equations of
motion and their quasiclassical quantization was motivated by the
discovery of the so called BMN scaling [ 152 ] . The conjecture of the
BMN scaling states that in the limit @xmath , @xmath the energy is
effectively expanded in terms of the BMN coupling @xmath . This scaling
gave a window for a direct comparison of strong and weak coupling
results since smallness of @xmath can be achieved both in perturbative
gauge and string theories since @xmath is large. For some of the
references concerning study of string configurations in this scaling and
its generalizations see [ 173 , 174 , 175 , 176 , 177 , 178 , 179 ] . We
will discuss some particular cases in the next section.

These initial investigations played an important role for the
development of integrability techniques. Later it became evident that
the BMN scaling is violated at higher orders. But soon the development
of the integrability gave precise predictions for certain anomalous
dimensions at strong coupling without relying on the BMN regime.

Solutions of string equations of motion can be described by a general
approach known as a finite gap method. Its application for AdS/CFT was
developed in a series of papers [ 180 , 181 , 182 , 183 , 184 ]
initiated by [ 19 ] . Based on the finite gap method, it was possible to
perform a general test for the validity of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz
on the string side at 1-loop approximation [ 185 ] .

There are also few two-loop calculations in string theory [ 186 , 187 ,
188 ] . The two-loop check of the integrability seems to be more
profound than the one loop one. The one-loop results could be obtained
by the quasiclassical quantization. Instead, a two-loop calculation
requires computing of Feynman diagrams. We discuss comparison of the
Bethe Ansatz prediction and the string two-loop predictions in
subsection 5.4.3 and chapter 8 . So far, at two loops there is an
agreement for the value of the cusp anomalous dimension [ 186 ] .
However, for more involved examples: generalized scaling function [ 187
] and Konishi operator [ 188 ] there are disagreements. The reason for
these disagreements is still not understood.

Before going to the explicit examples let us mention that there is an
important difference between the sigma-model and the string theory. In
the latter the world-sheet metric is a dynamical quantity. Although we
can always choose a reference frame in which the worldsheet metric is
flat, the dynamical nature of the metric leads to Virasoro constraints.
By fixing the Virasoro constraints we typically introduce the mass scale
into the system, as it happens for example in a light-cone gauge.
Therefore, finally we consider not the initial conformal sigma model (
5.24 ) but a field theory with massive excitations. The @xmath -function
for the coupling constant remains zero of course.

#### 5.4 Verifications of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz

All the examples considered below are based on the string states which
have at most two nonzero angular momenta. The formulation of the
perturbative string theory is known only when one of the angular momenta
is large. This requirement is also needed to be able to use the
asymptotic Bethe Ansatz.

##### 5.4.1 BMN particles and giant magnons.

In the seminal paper of Berenstein, Maldacena, and Nastase [ 152 ] the
string theory was considered in a type of the Penrose plane wave limit [
189 ] which described perturbations around fast moving point-like string
solution. The limit in [ 152 ] included

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here we will rather use the ’t Hooft limit ( 5.1 ) with additional
demand that the BMN coupling

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

is small. The excitations we are interested in are the same in two
cases. Therefore we will keep the name of BMN excitations (particles)
also for our case. Our reasoning follows closely to [ 173 ] .

To understand the nature of the BMN excitations it is useful to replace
string by a particle on @xmath . The lagrangian for such a particle is
given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

One has the conserved angular momentum

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

Fixing its value one can find the effective lagrangian for the
coordinate @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

We got a particle which moves in the effective potential with minimum at
@xmath . For large values of @xmath it is enough to use quadratic
approximation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

which leads to oscillations with frequency @xmath . Note that in this
example @xmath plays the role of the coupling constant.

The picture in the string theory is completely similar. The energy of
the particle is the analog of the string worldsheet energy. The coupling
constant in the string case is @xmath . The fast rotating string with
momenta @xmath leads to a massive relativistic field theory with @xmath
. The worldsheet energy is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

The spectrum is discrete since we consider closed strings.

The written expression ( 5.35 ) for @xmath looks like if we have only
one type of excitations. In fact, there are 16 of them - 8 bosonic and 8
fermionic. However, all their masses are equal as was shown by Metsaev
in [ 190 ] using symmetry.

To find the target space energy @xmath we should use the on-shell
condition which states that @xmath , where @xmath is a number of
worldsheet derivatives in the vertex operator corresponding to the
considered state. If we consider states with finite values of @xmath ,
the on-shell condition and ( 5.35 ) lead to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now we understand the meaning of the BMN coupling @xmath . This is a
square of the inverse mass of the BMN particle. If we assume that
spectrum of the theory is described by BMN particles, it is natural to
expect that the energy of the state is expanded in terms of @xmath . In
reality the BMN scaling is not an exact property. The reason is that the
harmonic oscillator approximation works only for the oscillations with
small mode numbers @xmath .

It will be convenient to introduce the worldsheet momentum

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

which will be a natural variable if we rescale the worldsheet volume
such that it is equal to @xmath .

The momentum @xmath is continuous in the large @xmath limit. The
harmonic oscillator approximation works for @xmath . For @xmath one may
expect a different from ( 5.36 ) dispersion relation. In fact, the exact
energy which is associated to each particle is equal to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

This expression was initially derived in [ 10 ] .

The excitations whose momentum scales at large @xmath as @xmath are
called giant magnons.

To understand better the giant magnons let us consider the bosonic
string sigma model on @xmath and choose the temporal gauge @xmath . In
this gauge the theory reduces to the @xmath sigma model. The equations
of motion for the @xmath sigma model via Pohlmeyer reduction [ 191 ]
reduce to the equations of motion for the sine-Gordon model. It is
well-known that the sine-Gordon model has kink solutions. Giant magnons
are equivalent to these kink solutions. For more details we refer to the
original paper of Hofman and Maldacena [ 14 ] and to the review of Dorey
[ 122 ] .

There is also an intermediate regime between the one of BMN particles
and giant magnons - near plane wave regime [ 192 ] . The momentum of
excitations in this regime scales as @xmath . From the dispersion
relation ( 5.38 ) it follows that @xmath . Interestingly, this scaling
is characteristic not only for the near plane wave excitations but for
the operators with finite value of @xmath [ 3 , 4 ] .

Let us now identify the considered excitations from the point of view of
the gauge theory.

On the gauge theory side the string moving at the speed of light
corresponds to the BPS vacuum ( 5.22 ). The transversal fluctuations
around this vacuum correspond to insertion of waves of some other
operator @xmath different from @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

The dispersion relation ( 5.38 ) is the consequence of invariance under
supersymmetry algebra [ 9 ] as we will explain in the next chapter.

In the case of the @xmath sector @xmath . At weak coupling the
expression for the energy ( 5.38 ) can be approximated by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this expression we recognize, up to an overall factor @xmath , the
dispersion relation for the XXX ferromagnet.

Let us summarize. At finite coupling there is one type of excitation -
spin wave in the integrable spin chain. At strong coupling three
possible scalings of this excitation are possible ⁸ ⁸ 8 numerical
analysis shows that for multipartite solutions a more general scaling of
the type @xmath is possible. However there is no macroscopically
significant amount of such particles. : giant magnon ( @xmath ), near
plane wave ( @xmath ), and BMN particle ( @xmath ).

##### 5.4.2 Folded and spinning strings.

A further possible generalization of the single particle excitations
discussed above is to consider a string with two large angular momenta.
If two of them, say @xmath and @xmath , are on the sphere, we obtain the
folded string rotating in @xmath . In @xmath this is a point-like string
situated at the center of @xmath . If one momentum @xmath is on @xmath
and another @xmath is on @xmath , we get the folded string rotating in
@xmath . In @xmath this is a point-like string spinning around equator.

On a gauge side the folded string on @xmath corresponds to the
multiparticle state in the @xmath sector, the folded string on @xmath
corresponds to the multiparticle state in the @xmath sector. The @xmath
case was initially analyzed in [ 193 ] , then both @xmath and @xmath
cases were treated on the common footing in [ 178 ] .

Let us discuss in more details these solutions in the one-loop
approximation on the gauge side of the correspondence.

The Bethe equations are written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the notation is the following. For the @xmath case: @xmath . For
the @xmath case: @xmath .

The energy is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

It will be useful to introduce the ratio

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

The structure of the Bethe Ansatz restricts @xmath to be larger than
@xmath . The positive values of @xmath can be arbitrary, however the
solution that we discuss in this subsection requires @xmath to be finite
in the large @xmath limit.

Taking the logarithm of the Bethe equations we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

For finite values of @xmath , positive or negative, and large values of
@xmath the Bethe roots scale as @xmath . Therefore we can approximate (
5.44 ) by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

We are interested in the solution with minimal energy and for simplicity
we take @xmath to be even. Such a solution is symmetric and is defined
by taking half of @xmath equal to 1 and other half equal to @xmath [ 193
, 178 ] .

One can interpret ( 5.45 ) as the force equilibrium equation in the
classical mechanics. If @xmath is negative, then the particles repel
along the real axis. This leads to their distribution on the real axis.
If @xmath is positive, then the particles attract along the real axis.
Instead, they repel in the imaginary direction. This leads to the fact
that for the @xmath subsector the lowest energy solution is given by two
symmetrically situated string-like configurations (see Fig. 5.3 ).

In the large @xmath limit ( 5.45 ) equation is solved by the techniques
developed in the context of the @xmath matrix model [ 194 , 195 ] .
Namely, we rely on the fact that the roots condensate on two cuts in the
complex plane (see Fig. 5.3 ). To see condensation one should rescale
@xmath .

Then it is useful to introduce the resolvent @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

This function is analytic everywhere except on the cuts. In the large
@xmath limit ( 5.45 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are the values of the resolvent from the right
and from the left of the cut respectively. If we differentiate the last
equation, then we obtain the equation for @xmath which has the solution

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

To fix the solution we used the fact that the resolvent should be
analytic outside the cuts and decrease as @xmath at infinity.

The branch points of the resolvent are @xmath and @xmath . @xmath and
@xmath are real (and are defined to be positive) in the @xmath case and
complex conjugated (and are defined to have positive real part) in the
@xmath case. The values of @xmath and @xmath are fixed from the
additional condition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

which follows from ( 5.47 ).

The energy found from the solution ( 5.48 ) with @xmath and @xmath fixed
by ( 5.49 ) is given by [ 178 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the elliptic integral of the first kind and @xmath is
the elliptic integral of the second kind:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

Interestingly, the energy in two different sectors is defined by a
single analytic function ( @xmath ) of the parameter @xmath .

To obtain the result ( 5.50 ) one considers the large @xmath limit while
the coupling constant is small (zero in fact). Of course, string
perturbative solution is valid only for large values of the coupling
constant. Therefore the large @xmath limit on a string theory side
should be formulated differently. The first step which is used for the
calculations on the string theory side is to consider the limit

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

This limit can be thought as introduction of the BMN couplings @xmath .
Some of the charges may be zero. Then the string movement in the
corresponding direction is switched off and we do not require the
scaling @xmath for such charges.

In the limit ( 5.52 ) the classical solution for the equations of motion
is known exactly [ 176 , 178 ] . The energy for such classical solution
can be represented as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

To be precise, let us consider the @xmath case. The large @xmath limit
with fixed @xmath leads to the following expansion of the energy

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

The term containing @xmath indeed coincides with ( 5.50 ) [ 178 ] .
@xmath agrees with two loop prediction from the gauge theory side [ 178
] . However, @xmath does not match with the three loop prediction from
the gauge theory side. This does not mean the violation of the AdS/CFT
correspondence but that the BMN scaling is not valid at this order of
perturbation theory.

Let us take a look once more on the solution ( 5.48 ). @xmath can be
viewed as a meromorphic differential which defines a Riemann surface.
Therefore the solution of the Bethe Ansatz in the thermodynamic (large
@xmath ) limit is characterized by the algebraic curve [ 19 ] .

The algebraic curve appears also on the string side. Indeed, let us
consider the differential @xmath , where @xmath is defined by ( 5.27 ).
This is a @xmath supermatrix. Let us take its particular eigenvalue
@xmath at some point @xmath . In general there are nontrivial cycles
starting and ending at @xmath , analytical continuation over which
brings @xmath to another eigenvalue of @xmath . Therefore @xmath is the
differential defined in general on the 8-sheeted Riemann surface.

What we can do is not to compare the energies given from string theory
and asymptotic Bethe Ansatz, but to compare the algebraic curves which
with additional constraints are in one to one correspondence with given
solutions. This is indeed can be done [ 19 ] , [ 180 , 181 , 182 , 183 ,
184 ] . This approach is known as the finite gap method. It gives a more
systematic way to describe possible string solutions. However, it is not
evident how to apply it beyond the quasiclassical approximation.

Of course, it is not compulsory to look only for the solutions only in
the BMN window. We can directly demand that the (all-loop)asymptotic
Bethe Ansatz gives the same results at strong coupling as the
perturbative results of the string sigma model. Using this demand it was
possible to fix the dressing factor at the tree [ 17 ] and one loop [
196 , 197 , 18 , 198 ] levels of the strong coupling expansion.

##### 5.4.3 Operators with logarithmic scaling of energy

Large @xmath ( @xmath ) scaling with fixed @xmath is not the only
possible regime for the operators that are described by two nonzero
angular momenta. Another interesting regime in the @xmath case is when
@xmath and @xmath scales in way that @xmath .

The possibility of using this regime to test the AdS/CFT correspondence
was initially recognized by Belitsky, Gorsky, and Korchemsky in [ 199 ]
. They showed that the spectrum in this regime depends on the value of
the parameter ⁹ ⁹ 9 In [ 199 ] the inverse parameter @xmath was used. We
use the notations of [ 24 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

In particular they discussed the case @xmath and showed that the
one-loop correction to the anomalous dimension scales in this case as
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

Appearance of the parameter @xmath is not accidental. At sufficiently
small @xmath the distance between the two cuts in the two-cut solution
(like in Fig. 5.3 on the right) can be approximated by the quantity
proportional to @xmath . This distance remains finite for finite @xmath
. Therefore @xmath can be thought as measure of distance between two
cuts.

When the cuts are situated at the finite distance from each other, the
solution ( 5.48 ) becomes inappropriate, since due to the required
rescaling @xmath ( 5.48 ) develops a singularity at the origin.

The logarithmic scaling regime acquired a lot of attention. In [ 49 , 24
] it was shown that the logarithmic scaling ( 5.56 ) also takes place in
the case of finite @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

The quantity @xmath is called the generalized scaling function.

###### Cusp anomalous dimension

The situation @xmath is realized in particular in the case when we are
dealing with finite twist operators ( 5.18 ) with large number @xmath of
covariant derivatives. The composite operators with large number of
covariant derivatives were investigated for arbitrary four-dimensional
gauge theory. All of them obey the logarithmic scaling ( 5.56 ) known
also as a Sudakov scaling.

For the case of twist two operators the scaling function @xmath is equal
to twice the cusp anomalous dimension [ 200 , 201 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

The same equality holds for the ground state of arbitrary finite twist
operator.

The cusp anomalous dimension was introduced in [ 202 , 203 ] . This
quantity depends on the gauge theory that we consider and it is
important for calculation of the scattering amplitudes. For @xmath SYM
the cusp anomalous dimension allows one to find exactly the four- and
five-point gluon amplitudes [ 204 ] . The cusp anomalous dimension was
found at weak coupling analytically up to three loops [ 205 , 206 ] and
numerically up to four loops, after an impressive effort [ 23 , 207 ] .

On a string theory side the finite twist operator correspond to the
folded string rotating in @xmath [ 173 ] . The logarithmic scaling
appears due to the approaching of the ends of string to the boundaries
of @xmath . The factor of two in ( 5.58 ) corresponds to the fact that
the folded string has two ends ¹⁰ ¹⁰ 10 A more general situation of the
so called spiky strings that have @xmath cusps, was discussed in [ 208 ]
. For that string configurations the coefficient of proportionality in
5.58 was found to be @xmath . . A nice physical arguments for the origin
of logarithmic scaling were given in [ 49 ] . The cusp anomalous
dimension was found at strong coupling at tree level [ 173 , 174 ] , one
[ 209 ] and two [ 186 ] loops.

Beisert, Eden, and Staudacher [ 21 ] derived from the asymptotic Bethe
Ansatz the integral equation, known as the BES equation, solution of
which allows to find the scaling function @xmath at finite values of the
coupling constant. Their proposal was based on the work of Eden and
Staudacher [ 22 ] and was different by introduction of the nontrivial
dressing factor @xmath . This was the first work where an exact
nonperturbative proposal for the dressing factor, built on an earlier
work [ 20 ] , appeared.

The calculation of the scaling function @xmath through the BES equation
gave the first nontrivial test for the AdS/CFT integrability conjecture
at four loops of weak coupling expansion [ 21 ] . The strong coupling
solution of the BES equation proved to more complicated. In [ 26 , 27 ]
, [ KSV1 , 28 ] the leading order of the strong coupling expansion was
found analytically. In [ 29 ] the first three orders were found
numerically. The subleading order was obtained in [ 30 , 31 ] by means
different from solving the BES equation (see section 8.4 ). In [ 32 ] ,
[ KSV2 ] a recursive procedure for analytical expansion to any desired
order was given. The obtained results reproduced the string theory
calculations at tree level [ 173 , 174 ] , one [ 209 ] , and two [ 186 ]
and gave a strong evidence of the correctness of the asymptotic Bethe
Ansatz. We present the results of [ KSV2 ] in section 8.2 and in
appendix E.2 .

###### Generalized scaling function

As we already mentioned, the logarithmic scaling also takes place for
finite values of the parameter @xmath [ 49 , 24 ] . A generalization of
the BES equation which allows finding the generalized scaling function
@xmath was given in [ 24 , 25 ] . This generalization is known as the
BES/FRS equation. Since we have an additional parameter @xmath , by
solving this equation at strong coupling we can test the integrability
on the functional level. The solution of the BES and BES/FRS equations
was a subject of our work. We discussion these equations in chapter 8 .

###### @xmath sigma model

One important regime proposed by Alday and Maldacena in [ 49 ] needs to
be mentioned. This is strong coupling limit in which @xmath is non-zero
but is exponentially small with respect to the coupling constant.

To understand what happens in this case let us discuss the spectrum of
excitations in the string sigma model. In the same way as it was for the
circular string in S @xmath , the folded string rotating in AdS @xmath
creates a centrifugal force. However, this force leads to the nonzero
mass only for bosonic fluctuations on AdS @xmath and for fermionic
fluctuations. The bosonic fluctuations on S @xmath are left massless on
the classical level. Therefore, if we consider low energetic
fluctuations of the folded string in AdS, they will be described by the
fluctuations on S @xmath , i.e. by the O(6) sigma model. The other
massive fluctuations serve as a cutoff for such low energy description.

On the quantum level the O(6) sigma model acquires a new mass scale via
the mechanism of the dimensional transmutation. The mass of the
particles can be given through the ’t Hooft coupling constant which in
the quasiclassical approximation coincides with the coupling constant of
O(6) sigma model:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

The power @xmath and the exponential factor are defined through the beta
function of the sigma model (see chapter 9 ). The constant @xmath is not
universal and depends on how the O(6) sigma model is embedded in the
whole string sigma model.

The strong coupling and the large @xmath regime with @xmath is described
by the @xmath sigma model in the presence of the chemical potential
which creates a finite density of particles (proportional to @xmath )
with rapidities on an interval @xmath . The boundary of the interval
@xmath is a function @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

When @xmath becomes of order of @xmath , we reach the cutoff where the
@xmath sigma model is no more appropriate. At larger energies we have to
deal with the full spectrum of the string sigma model.

The @xmath sigma model is the theory with a non-zero beta function which
allows in fact to have the parameter of dimensional transmutation ( 5.59
). From the other side, the parameter ( 5.59 ) is defined in terms of
the ’t Hooft coupling constant which has a vanishing beta function. This
seeming contradiction is resolved in the following way. We consider a
system which depends on three parameters: @xmath , and @xmath . In the
regime when the @xmath sigma model is applicable, it sufficient to have
two parameters: @xmath and @xmath . The reason why we multiplied by
@xmath is the following: if we normalize the worldsheet volume to some
constant, the mass of AdS excitations will scale as @xmath at large
@xmath . Therefore @xmath serves effectively as a mass scale. If we
simultaneously change @xmath and @xmath (keeping @xmath constant) in a
way that @xmath do not change, then the physics of the @xmath sigma
model will not change. We see that effectively @xmath runs with @xmath ,
and ( 5.59 ) reflects the nontrivial beta-function of this dependence.

The BES/FRS equation in the Alday-Maldacena regime was investigated in [
34 , 35 , 36 ] . In [ 34 ] Basso and Korchemsky derived the integral
equation for the @xmath sigma model from the BES/FRS equation. They also
derived the proper expression ( 5.59 ) for the mass scale and the
explicit value of the coefficient @xmath . In [ 210 ] , [ 35 , 36 ] a
numerical evidence for the presence of the mass scale ( 5.59 ) was
given. In subsection 8.3 we will give an alternative derivation of the
integral equation for the @xmath sigma model however without the
derivation of the coefficient @xmath .

#### 5.5 Summary

The AdS/CFT correspondence gives an explicit realization of long
standing attempts to formulate duality between gauge and string
theories. Despite its strong/weak coupling type, the AdS/CFT
correspondence can be directly verified, at least on the level of the
spectral problem, using the integrability technique. The problem of
diagonalization of the dilatation operator is shown to be equivalent to
the problem of diagonalization of the Hamiltonian of a certain spin
chain conjectured to be integrable. This problem is solved using the
bootstrap approach analogical to the one proposed by Zamolodchikov and
Zamolodchikov. The approach is based on the assumption of the factorized
scattering which allows to express all the processes in terms of the
two-particle S-matrix. The two-particle S-matrix can be uniquely fixed
by symmetry, unitarity, crossing, and an assumption about the particle
content ¹¹ ¹¹ 11 As we discuss in the next chapter, a strange feature of
the @xmath algebra allows to fix the S-matrix even without using of
Yang-Baxter equation. . The asymptotic Bethe Ansatz which can be derived
once the scattering matrix is known gives a possibility to explicitly
verify the integrability conjecture by comparison of the Bethe Ansatz
results with perturbative calculations on both sides of the AdS/CFT
correspondence. In this chapter we discussed checks that are based on
the consideration of such objects as single-particle excitations
(magnons), folded and spinning strings, operators with logarithmic
scaling of energy. The verifications of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz are
done today up to four loops on the gauge side and up to two loops on the
string side. Based on the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz, which we did not
discuss here, recently even five-loop check of integrability was done.
These results provide a strong evidence that the AdS/CFT system is
indeed integrable.

The properties of operators with logarithmic scaling of energy was a
subject of our work. We will present the details of our calculations in
chapters 7 and 8 . Before this, in chapter 6 we discuss in details the
derivation and main properties of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz.

### Chapter 6 Bootstrap approach and asymptotic Bethe Ansatz

In this chapter we discuss the derivation of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz
of the AdS/CFT integrable system. The derivation is based on
determination of the scattering matrix using the symmetry constraints
and then application of the nested or algebraic Bethe Ansatz procedure.
Technically the scattering matrix is found based on the arguments
similar to those of Zamolodchikov and Zamolodchikov [ 7 ] for
relativistic systems. However, the AdS/CFT scattering matrix has a
different physical interpretation. While the approach of [ 7 ] deals
with the excitations over the true vacuum of the theory, in the AdS/CFT
case we consider excitations over the BMN state @xmath which is more
likely as a pseudovacuum of the XXX spin chain.

The BMN state @xmath is invariant under the psu(2 @xmath 2) @xmath
subalgebra of the whole psu(2,2 @xmath 4) symmetry of the system [ 113 ]
. The generator of the central extension of this subalgebra is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the Bethe Ansatz description an excitation of @xmath is seen as the
state composed from a fixed number of magnons (see section 1.1 ). Far
from the collision point a single magnon is given by a plane wave:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
                       @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath stands for a type of a magnon.

Although an excitation over the BMN state should be covariant under the
action of psu(2 @xmath 2) @xmath , a single magnon does not have this
property. The symmetry algebra closes when acting on the one magnon
configuration only for the case @xmath .

It was suggested in [ 9 ] that we should extend the symmetry algebra
with two additional central charges to get a closed action on ( 6 ).
Then a symmetry algebra which allows us to study a magnon scattering is
psu(2 @xmath 2) @xmath . The appearance of two additional central
charges was confirmed from the string theory perspective [ 211 ] . From
the point of view of the gauge theory such analysis was not done.
Though, the idea of central extension leads to simple and
self-consistent explanations for many properties of the AdS/CFT system.
This makes it hard to doubt in the correctness of the suggestion.

We see that it is logical to start discussion by reviewing the basic
properties of the centrally extended @xmath algebra and its
representations. After that we come back to the discussion of the
magnons and their scattering and give the expression for the scattering
matrix up to an overall scalar factor. These topics are the subject of
the section 6.1 in which we follow closely the ideas of [ 8 , 9 , 165 ]
¹ ¹ 1 Mostly a gauge theory point of view on the scattering is discussed
here. A complementary approach based on a Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra
and more natural for the string theory is given in [ 15 ] . . In section
6.2 we formulate the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz proposed in [ 11 ] and
derived in [ 9 , 166 , 212 ] . Then in section 6.3 we formulate the
crossing equations (based on [ 16 ] , see also [ 15 ] ) on the overall
scalar factor of the S-matrix, explicitly solve them, and formulate a
sufficient set of conditions that uniquely fix the solution. The
presented solution of the crossing equations is based on [ V3 ] . The
resulting expression for the scalar factor was initially proposed in [
20 , 22 ] and then checked to solve the crossing equations in [ 213 ] .
We finish this chapter with section 6.4 where is given, based on Cauchy
type integral operators, a shorthand notation for the Bethe equations
and following from them in a thermodynamic limit functional equations.

#### 6.1 Scattering matrix from symmetry constraints

##### 6.1.1 @xmath algebra

We will start from the @xmath algebra with one central charge. This is
just an @xmath algebra.

To describe the structure of @xmath algebra it is instructive to
consider its four-dimensional representation. The vector space of this
representation is a direct sum @xmath of two-dimensional spaces: @xmath
with even grading and @xmath with odd grading. The @xmath generators can
be combined in the following block matrix:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

If to denote the basis of @xmath by @xmath and the basis of @xmath by
@xmath then the action of the generators is the following:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.4)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The explicit action of @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Commutation relations in the algebra are described as follows. @xmath
and @xmath form the @xmath bosonic subgroup and act on @xmath by the
fundamental representation for the correspondent index. The nonzero
commutator ² ² 2 When dealing with superalgebras, by commutator we
always understand the graded commutator. between the fermionic
generators is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the central charge @xmath equals @xmath for the four-dimensional
representation. Abstract definition of @xmath has no restriction on
@xmath . For arbitrary value of @xmath the minimal dimension of the
representation is @xmath . The condition @xmath is also called a
shortening condition since the four-dimensional representation has a
smaller dimension than the minimal possible dimension for arbitrary
@xmath .

An exceptional feature of the @xmath algebra is that its central
extension has two central charges in addition to @xmath , therefore a
complete centrally extended @xmath algebra is @xmath . The centrally
extended algebra possesses @xmath group of external automorphisms. These
features are due to the fact that there exists an antisymmetric
invariant bilinear form @xmath which allows raising and lowering of
indexes. Due to this the adjoint actions of the bosonic subalgebra
@xmath on @xmath and on @xmath are equivalent. To fix the notation we
define

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

Let us introduce

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

Then the commutation relations of the fermionic generators are given by
³ ³ 3 This form of the commutator is related to the fact that the
centrally extended @xmath can be viewed as a @xmath limit of the
exceptional Lie superalgebra @xmath . The latter has @xmath bosonic
subalgebra. The generators of the bosonic subalgebra are identified with
@xmath and @xmath . Fermionic subspace is spanned by @xmath . Adjoint
action of @xmath and @xmath on @xmath -s is given by the fundamental
representation related respectively to @xmath and @xmath indices. The
commutator of @xmath -s is given by

@xmath (6.9)

For generic @xmath the generators @xmath do not commute with each other.
But they do in the limit @xmath . In this limit we recover ( 6.10 ) from
( 6.9 ).

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath is a symmetric matrix of central charges. @xmath . In the
notations of [ 9 ] @xmath and @xmath .

The @xmath outer automorphisms rotate the third index of @xmath . The
matrix @xmath form a symmetric three-dimensional representation of the
external @xmath group with an invariant @xmath .

The existence of a four dimensional representation is possible if a
shortening condition @xmath is satisfied. We will denote such
representation by @xmath .

For @xmath the four dimensional representation is not faithful since
@xmath . The faithful representation with nonzero central charges is
infinite dimensional. The faithful infinite dimensional representation
is important for identification of the scattering matrix. Therefore we
will now discuss this representation.

The basis in the vector space of the faithful representation is chosen
to be the following: @xmath and @xmath , where @xmath is integer. The
bosonic generators @xmath and @xmath do not act on @xmath . They act on
@xmath and @xmath according to ( 6.1.1 ).

The action of the other generators is the following

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.11)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.12)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is either @xmath or @xmath .

The closure of the commutation relations requires that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

The case ( 6.1.1 ) corresponds to @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . If we
reduce the representation to four dimensions by identifying @xmath , it
is easy to see that ( 6.13 ) is equivalent to the shortening condition
@xmath .

##### 6.1.2 Action of the algebra on 1-particle and two particle states

According to the nested Bethe Ansatz construction which was explained in
the first chapter, a generic one-particle state is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                       @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.14)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The action of the symmetry algebra on this state is given by ( 6.1.1 )
if to identify the field @xmath with the markers @xmath in ( 6.1.1 ) and
the field @xmath with @xmath or @xmath [ 165 ] . Notice an unusual
property of the symmetry algebra: its action changes the length of the
spin chain.

In the basis @xmath the representation ( 6.1.1 ) rearranges into
four-dimensional blocks. The action of the generators on @xmath is the
same as in ( 6.1.1 ) except for the replacements:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

The second replacement plays an important role for the case of two and
more particles and in particular leads to a nontrivial coproduct
structure. Indeed, a generic two-particle state can be written as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                       @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.16)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Therefore

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

As a consequence, the action of the generators that change the number of
@xmath -s contain an additional factor @xmath . In particular, the
co-product of @xmath is given by [ 214 , 9 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

To put the coproduct in the symmetric form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

one should impose

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are two arbitrary parameters.

We see that the representation becomes dependent on the momentum @xmath
of the particle.

Equivalently, the action of @xmath is given by @xmath . From the
shortening condition we obtain the expression for C:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

In view of ( 6.1 ) and ( 5.14 ), the energy of the magnon should be
identified with @xmath . Therefore ( 6.21 ) can be seen as the
dispersion relation.

The constant @xmath cannot be fixed using the properties of the @xmath
algebra. However, the dispersion relation ( 6.21 ) was derived in [ 10 ]
using a different approach. Based on [ 10 ] it is possible to identify
@xmath with the coupling @xmath defined by ( 5.11 ).

###### Parametrization.

Using rescaling of basis vectors in ( 6.1.1 ) we can always adjust the
constants @xmath to fulfill the following two criteria. First, we demand
that @xmath . We can even put @xmath , however for the reasons explained
below @xmath should be kept explicitly. Second, we demand @xmath . Using
these restrictions, the constants @xmath are uniquely parameterized as:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.22)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The parameter @xmath is fixed by the shortening condition ( 6.13 ) which
implies

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

We should choose the solution with the property: @xmath when @xmath .

We see that the representation is uniquely defined by the momentum of
the particle @xmath and the coupling constant @xmath .

###### Hopf algebra picture.

In the Hopf algebra picture, proposed for the AdS/CFT scattering matrix
in [ 214 ] , for each particle with momentum @xmath we associate the
representation @xmath with the coefficients @xmath given by ( 6.22 ).
The coefficient @xmath should be equal for all particles and may be put
to @xmath .

The coproduct is nontrivial for @xmath and is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.24)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The two-particle wave function is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath -matrix should satisfy

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this notation @xmath matrix acts on two @xmath -dimensional
representations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Twisted picture

The Hopf product becomes the standard one if we redefine the value of
@xmath . Before scattering we will put @xmath and @xmath . After
scattering it will be opposite @xmath , @xmath . In this picture the
@xmath -matrix is invariant under the standard coproduct:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

but the representations of the particles before scattering are different
from the representations of the particles after scattering:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.29)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

##### 6.1.3 Zhukovsky parameterization

Let us introduce two parameters @xmath and @xmath defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

The shortening condition ( 6.23 ) is then expressed as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation defines an algebraic curve which is a torus. A useful
parameterization, not uniform however, for the torus is given in terms
of the parameter @xmath defined by:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us define the Zhukovsky map @xmath by the relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then the parameters @xmath and @xmath are the double-valued functions of
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

A choice of the branches of these functions is constrained by the demand
that the @xmath limit should be smooth. If momentum of the particle is
real at all values of the coupling constant then smooth @xmath limit
implies that @xmath . The region defined by @xmath is usually called the
physical region.

The parameter @xmath is an equivalent of the rapidity in the Heisenberg
ferromagnet and for @xmath coincides with it. Let us show the
coincidence on the example of the energy:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the limit @xmath we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is a correct expression for the energy of the XXX magnon ( 1.19 ).

##### 6.1.4 Scattering matrix

When central charges do not obey any shortening condition, a minimal
dimension of an irrep of @xmath algebra is @xmath . In general position
the three central charges of the tensor product of two short irreps do
not obey a shortening condition. Therefore the tensor product of two
four-dimensional representations of the @xmath algebra is in general
position an irreducible representation. Thus the @xmath -matrix can be
fixed up to a scalar factor from symmetry constraints.

The matrix elements of scattering matrix obtained in Hopf algebra
formulation differ from those obtained in twisted picture by a phase.
This is due to the different choice of the parameter @xmath and
therefore a basis redefinition. Different choices of @xmath distinguish
@xmath -matrix obtained from the Hopf algebra formulation, @xmath
-matrix obtained from a Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra [ 15 ] , and
@xmath -matrix of the Hubbard model [ 166 ] . In the following we deal
with the @xmath -matrix which is used for construction of a wave
function 6.25 .

The structure of the @xmath -matrix is quite involved. It can be found
in the original work of Beisert [ 165 ] . Here we will give the @xmath
invariant formulation of the scattering matrix presented in [ 165 ] .

The infinite dimension representation ( 6.1.1 ) is decomposed into
four-dimensional blocks if we consider the action of the @xmath
subalgebra. This subalgebra is constructed from the generators @xmath
and the central charge @xmath . The commutation relations of @xmath
algebra are recovered after the following identification with the
generators of Sec. 4.1 :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath                        (6.38)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The subspace @xmath is invariant under the action of the @xmath
subalgebra and forms the typical irrep @xmath with @xmath . The tensor
product of two such irreps of @xmath is decomposed into direct sum of
three representations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

of dimension @xmath , 8, and 4 respectively.

The scattering matrix is given by the sum of the projectors on these
representations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

The scattering matrix has two special points. When @xmath , the
scattering matrix reduces to the @xmath . When @xmath the scattering
matrix reduces to @xmath . These properties of the scattering matrix
allow performing the fusion procedure as it was in the case of rational
R-matrices. In particular, the transfer matrices constructed from fused
@xmath satisfy Hirota equation as a function of @xmath on a fat hook
shape of @xmath algebra.

#### 6.2 Beisert-Staudacher asymptotic Bethe Ansatz

The asymptotic Bethe Ansatz was proposed by Beisert and Staudacher [ 11
] before the full factorized @xmath -matrix was found. Later it was
rigorously derived based on the knowledge of the @xmath -matrix ( 6.40 )
and using the coordinate nested Bethe Ansatz [ 9 , 212 ] and the
algebraic Bethe Ansatz [ 166 ] . It is given by the following set of
equations:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
                       @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.41)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The notations here are the following:

1.  The parameter @xmath , @xmath counts the number of Bethe roots of
    the @xmath -th type.

    The relation between @xmath , @xmath and the charges @xmath , @xmath
    defined by ( 5.28 ) is given by the following formulas:

      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.42)
      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

2.  The functions @xmath , @xmath are defined through the Zhukovsky map
    by

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.43)
      -- -------- -- --------

    supplemented by the condition @xmath . This condition is natural for
    the central roots @xmath since the energy is expressed through this
    roots by

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.44)
      -- -------- -- --------

    and it should have a proper @xmath limit. However, the condition
    @xmath is somehow artificial for the Bethe roots of type @xmath .
    Indeed, up to the replacement @xmath the first equation coincides
    with the third one. Therefore it is possible to unite the equations
    for the roots of type @xmath and @xmath into one if to not impose
    constraints on the choice of the branch for @xmath . The same is
    true for the roots of type @xmath and @xmath .

3.  The Bethe equations describe the spectrum of the single trace
    operators. Since the shift of all nodes by one does not change the
    single trace operator due to the cyclicity of the trace, the overall
    momentum of the spin chain should obey a constraint

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.45)
      -- -------- -- --------

4.  The factor @xmath was introduced in [ 42 ] . It is equal to @xmath
    when the fermionic excitations obey periodic boundary conditions and
    to @xmath when the boundary conditions are antiperiodic. For the
    AdS/CFT case the boundary conditions are such that

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.46)
      -- -------- -- --------

    We could in principle cancel out the factor @xmath and the terms
    @xmath in the Bethe Ansatz. However we do not make this cancelation
    since the Bethe Ansatz equations in the form ( 6.41 ) are valid even
    if the condition ( 6.45 ) is not satisfied.

5.  The explicit form of the scalar factor @xmath will be given in the
    next section after the crossing equations that determine @xmath are
    solved.

To finish the description of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz a map between
the configuration of Bethe roots and single trace operators should be
given. A graphical answer to this question is presented in Fig.1 of [
215 ] . Here we will focus on the two simplest examples discussed in the
previous chapter: @xmath and @xmath sectors of the theory.

The @xmath sector is spanned by the operators ( 5.16 ). This sector is
described by the Bethe equations ( 5.23 ) which are recovered from (
6.41 ) by putting @xmath . Number @xmath of fields @xmath is equal to
@xmath , number of fields @xmath is equal to @xmath , @xmath .

The @xmath sector is spanned by the operators of type ( 5.18 ). In this
case the length of the spin chain is equal to the number of the fields
@xmath , @xmath . Number of covariant derivatives acting on one field
@xmath is interpreted as the number of excitation of the corresponding
node. Each covariant derivative corresponds to a complex ⁴ ⁴ 4 This
complex is not a string-like configuration. All Bethe roots are real. of
three Bethe roots: one bosonic root of type @xmath , one fermionic root
of type @xmath , and one fermionic root of type @xmath . Therefore the
total number @xmath of excitations is equal to @xmath , the parameters
@xmath are equal to zero. In view of ( 6.42 ) the AdS charge @xmath is
equal to @xmath .

Instead of writing three types of Bethe equations for three types of
Bethe roots it is possible to perform a duality transformation on the
fermionic roots and get only one type of Bethe equations. For @xmath it
is the same duality transformation that was discussed in section 4.4 .
Its generalization exists for the case @xmath [ 9 ] . We depicted in
Fig. 6.3 the Dynkin diagrams which correspond to the Bethe equations (
6.41 ) and dual transformed Bethe equations.

After the duality transformation the @xmath sector is described by the
following set of Bethe equations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 6.3 Crossing equations

##### 6.3.1 Sketch of derivation

The scalar factor @xmath which appears in the Beisert-Staudacher
asymptotic Bethe Ansatz cannot be fixed from the continuous symmetries
of the system. The same situation happens in the bootstrap approach for
the relativistic theories (see chapter 2 ). However, in relativistic
theories there are also discrete symmetries which lead to the existence
of antiparticles. From these symmetries additional functional equations
(crossing equations) on the scattering matrix can be derived. These
equations together with an assumption on the physical spectrum of the
theory and unitarity condition unambiguously fix the scalar factor [ 7 ]
.

Although the light-cone quantized string theory is not relativistically
invariant and the presence of discrete symmetries is not evident, it was
argued by Janik [ 16 ] that one can hope to have a kind of the crossing
equations on the scattering matrix ( 6.40 ). Janik derived such crossing
equations assuming that, written in a general algebraic form, they are
the same as the ones for the relativistic theories. This general form is
the following ⁵ ⁵ 5 Strictly speaking, ( 6.48 ) is not the crossing
equations used in a relativistic theory. Equation ( 6.48 ) is derived
from the crossing equations and the unitarity condition. :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , @xmath is a symmetry algebra, and @xmath is the
antihomomorphism of the symmetry algebra.

On the level of the representation @xmath , the action of the antipode
@xmath on an arbitrary generator @xmath is realized as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a representation (for anitparticles) which is in general
different from @xmath , @xmath is a charge conjugation (intertwining)
matrix and @xmath means supertransposition ⁶ ⁶ 6 we need to perform
transposition since @xmath is an antihomomorphism. .

For the case of the @xmath @xmath -matrix ( 6.40 ) the representation
@xmath is the four dimensional representation of the centrally extended
@xmath algebra defined by the parameters @xmath .

The equation ( 6.48 ), realized on the representation @xmath , is a
matrix equation on the scattering matrix ( 6.40 ) in which only a single
scalar factor is not fixed. The demand that this equation holds fixes
unambiguously @xmath and @xmath . This was done in [ 16 ] under the
condition that @xmath .

The representation @xmath is parameterized by @xmath which are related
to @xmath of @xmath via the substitution

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

This substitution leads to the change of sign for the energy and the
momentum. Note that the representation @xmath is not contained in any
tensor product of @xmath . Therefore the antiparticles are not
excitations of the asymptotic spin chain. This is an important
difference with compact representations in the nonsupersymmetric case.
This difference was discussed in chapter 4 .

The existence of @xmath and @xmath consistent with ( 6.48 ) is a
nontrivial fact which supports the conjecture of the existence of the
crossing equations for the scattering matrix ( 6.40 ). After
identification of @xmath and @xmath the crossing equations lead to the
following equation on the scalar factor @xmath in ( 6.41 ) [ 16 , 216 ]
:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us explain the meaning of the superscript @xmath . We consider the
dressing factor @xmath as a multivalued function of @xmath . The
spectral parameter @xmath defines @xmath , and therefore the parameters
@xmath of the representation, by the relation @xmath (see ( 6.34 )). The
superscript @xmath means that the first particle in the @xmath -matrix
should be in the @xmath representation, i.e. we should use the
replacement ( 6.50 ). This replacement is realized as the analytical
continuation of @xmath along the contour @xmath in the @xmath -plane ⁷ ⁷
7 The monodromy over @xmath also leads to ( 6.50 ). But the solution of
crossing equation with such monodromy seems to be pathological if one
requires analytical properties of the dressing factor natural for the
physical theory. The situation is opposite in the mirror theory. If to
require analytical properties of the scattering matrix natural for the
mirror theory, the crossing equation with the monodromy over @xmath is
the right one. Its solution is the ”improved” dressing phase of [ 213 ]
as we discuss in appendix C . . This contour is depicted in Fig. 6.4 .
It encircles the branch points @xmath . The dressing factor @xmath has a
nontrivial monodromy along the contour @xmath as it is seen from the
equations ( 6.51 ).

In principle, it is possible to resolve both branch cuts @xmath and
@xmath using an elliptic parameterization [ 16 ] . In terms of the
elliptic variable @xmath used in [ KSV1 ] and related to the one of [ 16
] by a Gauss-Landen transformation the crossing transformation is given
by @xmath . However, as we will see below, the dressing phase has not
two but infinitely many cuts. Therefore the elliptic parameterization
for the dressing phase is not very useful. We will not use the elliptic
parameterization in this work.

##### 6.3.2 Solution

One can show that the solution of the crossing equation can be fixed
uniquely by the following set of requirements on its analytical
structure [ V3 ] :

-   @xmath can be represented in the following form [ 17 , 216 ] :

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.52)
      -- -------- -- --------

    where @xmath is antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of
    variables: @xmath .

    In the following we will use the functions @xmath and @xmath defined
    by

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (6.53)
      -- -------- -- --------

-   @xmath is an analytic single-valued function for the physical domain
    @xmath . This domain is the analog of the physical strip @xmath in
    relativistic models. The condition of analyticity can be seen as the
    minimality condition.

-   @xmath as a function of @xmath does not have branch points except
    those that are explicitly required by the crossing equation. The
    required branch points are of the square root type. This is a
    condition of compatibility of the analytical structure of the
    dressing phase and analytical structure of the Bethe equations. It
    can be compared with demand for the S-matrix in relativistic
    theories to be meromorphic function of the rapidity variable @xmath
    .

-   @xmath for @xmath . This asymptotics is compatible with the
    asymptotics of the strong coupling expansion of the dressing phase
    which is known from string theory calculations.

To solve the crossing equation let us first understand how the contour
@xmath looks like in the @xmath plane for the functions @xmath and
@xmath . This contour is shown if Fig. 6.5 .

Since @xmath may not be single-valued in the domain @xmath , it may
happen (and it does) that @xmath as a function of @xmath and @xmath as a
function of @xmath after the continuation @xmath are on different
Riemann sheets of the @xmath plane. To avoid this problem we
analytically continue the crossing equation ( 6.51 ) along the path
@xmath , shown in Fig. 6.4 and Fig. 6.5 .

The crossing equation at the point @xmath is written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath means the analytical continuation of @xmath from the point
@xmath to the point @xmath via the path @xmath .

The r.h.s. of ( 6.54 ) was obtained with the help of the property

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

At the point @xmath , in contradistinction to the point @xmath , we are
allowed to write:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

All four functions @xmath which are used in ( 6.56 ) are on the same
Riemann sheet of the @xmath plane.

We can write ( 6.54 ) in terms of the shift operator as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

The shift operator @xmath is not well defined inside the strip @xmath
since we can cross the cut of @xmath and go to another sheet. To avoid
this ambiguity, we will consider the crossing equation ( 6.57 ) outside
this strip, solve it, and then analytically continue the solution.

The function @xmath as a function of @xmath does not have a branch cut
@xmath . A solution of ( 6.57 ) with this property is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Strictly speaking, this expression should be regularized to have a
precise meaning. However, the regulating terms will cancel for the
complete dressing factor @xmath .

The expression ( 6.3.2 ) can be further simplified if we use the
functions @xmath and the relation @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

The multiplier @xmath does not contribute to ( 6.3.2 ). It is needed for
the consistency with the antisymmetry of @xmath with respect to
interchange @xmath . Indeed, a direct calculation shows that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (6.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

whose logarithm is antisymmetric with respect to @xmath as it should.

By taking the logarithm of ( 6.3.2 ) we get a simple Riemann-Hilbert
problem which is solved by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the kernel @xmath defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

The kernel @xmath is constructed to satisfy the following equation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

The subscripts @xmath and @xmath in ( 6.60 ) refer to action of @xmath
on @xmath and @xmath variables respectively.

This solution was chosen among the other possible solutions by the
requirement that @xmath should be analytic for @xmath and @xmath . The
kernel @xmath appears also in the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. We will
discuss this issue in Sec. 6.4 .

The expression ( 6.60 ) can be rewritten in the form proposed by Dorey,
Hofman, and Maldacena [ 217 ] if we rewrite the action of the kernel
@xmath as the integral in the Zhukovsky plane

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

and note that the second term does not contribute to the dressing phase.

##### 6.3.3 Analytical structure of the dressing factor

We will discuss now the analytical structure of the factor @xmath as a
function of @xmath . The analytical properties of the whole dressing
factor @xmath can be then easily derived.

On the physical sheet @xmath the function @xmath has only one square
root cut @xmath . Analytical structure of @xmath for @xmath can be seen
from the formula ( 6.3.2 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

We see that in this region @xmath has infinitely many cuts @xmath . In
the product in the l.h.s. of ( 6.64 ) the branches for @xmath are chosen
in a way that @xmath .

If we analytically continue @xmath through one of the cuts @xmath we
will arrive at a new Riemann sheet (the third one in Fig. 6.6 ) which
contains, at the position @xmath , pole if @xmath or zero if @xmath .
This pole/zero was first observed in [ 217 ] . It was shown there that
it does not correspond to any bound state but is due to the specific
properties of Feynman diagrams in two-dimensional theories.

#### 6.4 The kernel @xmath and a shorthand notation for the Bethe
equations

The kernels @xmath that had appeared in the derivation of the dressing
phase appear also explicitly in the context of the Bethe Ansatz
equations. Indeed, one can directly check that ⁸ ⁸ 8 A standard choice
of branches is assumed in ( 6.65 ) for the region @xmath , then
analytical continuation is performed.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore we get a shorthand notation for the building blocks of the
Bethe equations:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.66)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Using the property ( 6.65 ) and the representation for gamma functions
used in ( 6.3.2 ) one can show that the dressing factor can be
represented in the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

where both the kernel @xmath and @xmath -operator act on @xmath
variable.

We should admit that in ( 6.66 ) and ( 6.67 ) we used the shift operator
in the sense

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

that is without performing analytical continuation. In opposite, in such
formulas as ( 3.16 ) we used the shift operator in the sense of
analytical continuation. To avoid ambiguity, the following two rules of
writing and interpreting formulas are applied. First, an expression if
possible should be considered in a region where there is no ambiguity
between two interpretations of the shift operator. For instance in the
case ( 3.16 ) the equation should be defined in the region @xmath , then
it may be analytically continued. Second, if we cannot reach a region
without ambiguities (for example we are required to stay on the real
axis) then expression @xmath is understood in the sense ( 6.68 ). To
explicit the case of analytical continuation we use the notation @xmath
or @xmath , where @xmath corresponds to the analytic continuation from
above the cut and @xmath corresponds to the analytic continuation from
below the cut. As an example see ( 9.20 ) and ( 8.31 ).

Taking into account the remarks about the sense of ( 6.66 ) and ( 6.67
), we can write down the Bethe Ansatz equations ( 6.41 ) in a shorthand
way. For this we introduce seven Baxter polynomials

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Bethe equations ( 6.41 ) will take the following form:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
                       @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.70)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The given notation is a generalization of ( 1.58 ), however without
introducing string configurations. In the limit @xmath we have also
@xmath and ( 1.58 ) is recovered from ( 6.70 ).

We see that the Bethe equations ( 6.41 ) can be expressed through the
Baxter polynomials in the power of an operator which is a rational
combination of @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath . To compare, analogical
operator in the case of spin chain contains polynomial combination of
@xmath and @xmath and in the case of relativistic integrable models -
rational combination of @xmath and @xmath .

#### 6.5 The kernel @xmath and functional equations.

When we pass to the integral equations we should take logarithm and then
derivative of the Bethe equations. For this purpose it is useful to
introduce the kernel @xmath by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

The function @xmath also satisfies ( 6.62 ). The relation between the
kernels @xmath and @xmath is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.72)
  -- -------- -- --------

Indeed, using ( 6.63 ) we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore for example:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.74)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us see how we can use the shorthand notations to derive a functional
equation on the resolvent of Bethe roots from ( 6.47 ) in the large
@xmath limit. By taking the logarithm of ( 6.47 ) we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.75)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the derivative of @xmath can be read from ( 6.5 ).

Now we use the fact that in the large @xmath limit the approximation
@xmath is valid. Here

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.76)
  -- -------- -- --------

is the density of particles and @xmath is the density of holes (in the
@xmath case holes are zeroes of the transfer matrix, see Sec. 7.2 ). We
can introduce the resolvent for the density of holes by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.77)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then, in the large @xmath limit the derivative of ( 6.75 ) is written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (6.78)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation can be written in the form @xmath , where the function
@xmath is analytic in the upper half plane and the function @xmath is
analytic in the lower half plane ⁹ ⁹ 9 Here we basically give a
variation of the procedure of holomorphic projection explained in Sec.
3.1 . . Therefore @xmath . We therefore obtain an equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.79)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is valid in the upper half plane. Equation in the lower half plane
can be obtained from ( 6.79 ) by replacement @xmath .

Equation ( 6.79 ) is almost a BES/FRS equation [ 21 , 24 ] which we
discuss in chapter 8 . To obtain the BES/FRS equation we still have to
perform a proper scaling of the resolvents as discussed in section 7.3 .

If the resolvent admit some parity properties, ( 6.79 ) can be slightly
simplified. Let us decompose the resolvent into the symmetric and
antisymmetric parts: @xmath . The parity of the resolvent is opposite to
the parity of the density.

We use

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The kernels @xmath first appeared in [ KSV2 ] where they were derived
using analytical transformations of the inverse Fourier transform of
@xmath and @xmath of [ 21 ] .

Using ( 6.5 ) we can rewrite ( 6.79 ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.81)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the case of an even density distribution ( @xmath ) we get the
BES/FRS equation, up to a proper rescaling of the resolvents, in the
form used in [ V1 ] .

## Part III Functional form of integral Bethe Ansatz equations

In order to compare the prediction of the Bethe Ansatz equations for the
spectrum of the system with the field theoretical prediction one should
often consider the thermodynamical limit in which the Bethe Ansatz
equations reduce to the integral equation on the density of roots.
Therefore it is important to be able to solve these integral equations.

In the simplest case the equations can be solved using the Fourier
transform. For example such is the equation which describes the density
of roots of the state that corresponds to the antiferromagnetic vacuum
of the XXX spin chain:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.82)
  -- -------- -- --------

The solution of this equation is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.83)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the first part of this thesis we discussed a slightly different
approach which allows solving such equations. If we introduce the
resolvent

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.84)
  -- -------- -- --------

and integrate ( 6.82 ) with a Cauchy kernel @xmath , then we will get
the functional equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.85)
  -- -------- -- --------

and a complex conjugated equation for @xmath . This functional equation
can be solved for @xmath by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.86)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then the density function will be given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.87)
  -- -------- -- --------

Comparing position of poles and the residues for ( 6.83 ) and ( 6.87 )
we conclude that ( 6.83 ) and ( 6.87 ) are equal.

A more complicated case is when the density of Bethe roots is defined on
a compact support. For example, for the SU(2) XXX spin chain in the case
when the number of Bethe roots @xmath is smaller than @xmath the
equation ( 6.82 ) is replaced by ( 6.88 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.88)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the branch point @xmath is defined by @xmath . The function @xmath
(”density of holes”) is zero on the interval @xmath and is defined
outside it in such a way that the equation ( 6.88 ) is valid on the
whole real axis.

We cannot use directly the Fourier transform for solution of the
equation ( 6.88 ). For finite values of @xmath such equations in general
do not have explicit solution. However they can be solved perturbatively
for small and large values of @xmath .

We will consider a more interesting case of large values of @xmath . In
this case it is important to consider two different regimes.

First, we can rescale our rapidity variable as @xmath and consider the
limit @xmath with @xmath fixed. For this scaling we can perturbatively
expand the shift operator as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.89)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using this expansion, we can reduce functional equations on the
resolvents to a recursive tower of solvable Riemann-Hilbert problems.

Second, we can consider the vicinity of the branch point @xmath . For
this we should consider the double scaling limit

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.90)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this limit the equation ( 6.88 ) reduces to the integral equation on
the semiinfinite axis. It can be solved by a Wiener-Hopf method [ 218 ]
. This approach was used in many applications. We can mention [ 39 , 38
, 219 ] which are related to the integrability. We will discuss the
solution in the double scaling limit ( 6.90 ) in details in Sec. 7.4 .

The large @xmath and the double scaling limit of ( 6.88 ) lead to the
equations which allow in general many solutions. Only in the leading
order the solution can be fixed uniquely by imposing correct analytical
properties. We will show that in order to fix the solution in the
subleading orders of @xmath expansion we have to consider solutions in
both limits and demand their matching in the intermediate regime.

The search for the subleading orders of solutions of such equations has
a number of different motivations.

In chapter 7 we discuss the integral equation which appears in a special
limit of the @xmath Heisenberg ferromagnet. As we will explain, the
first three orders of the large @xmath expansion has a certain interest
for the AdS/CFT correspondence. The large @xmath expansion of this
system was investigated numerically in [ 220 , V1 ] . Here we give an
analytical derivation of this expansion. We also use this derivation to
explain all the details of our method.

In chapter 8 we discuss the so called BES/FRS equation [ 22 , 21 ] , [
24 ] which appears in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The
first three orders of the strong coupling expansion of this equation in
various regimes are required for the comparison with the perturbative
results of string theory [ 186 , 187 ] . This chapter is based on the
works [ KSV1 , KSV2 , V1 ] .

In chapter 9 we discuss how to find the mass gap in sigma models. For
instance, to fix the mass gap in the @xmath sigma model [ 39 ] we need
to find the first two (leading and subleading) orders of the large
@xmath expansion. The higher orders allow studying the Borel summability
properties of the model and in this way provide a check for the
correctness of the Bethe Ansatz description of the model. This chapter
is based on the author’s work [ V2 ] .

### Chapter 7 @xmath Heisenberg magnet

#### 7.1 Quantum mechanics reminder

The quantum mechanics of one particle is described by the Schr @xmath
dinger equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

To consider this equation in the quasiclassical limit it is convenient
to introduce a new variable @xmath in which the Schr @xmath dinger
equation reduces to the Ricatti equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the quasiclassical approximation which is valid for @xmath the
solution is simplified to @xmath . Then the wave function is given by
the superposition of two functions

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

For @xmath one of the exponents (say the second one) is exponentially
suppressed. To glue solutions in two different limits one should perform
in detail analysis in the vicinity of the turning points @xmath given by
@xmath . This analysis leads to the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization
condition on the energy levels of the particle

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a constant known as Maslow index. Its value depends on
the analytical properties of the potential @xmath near the turning
points. In particular, if it is smooth then @xmath , if it is a steep
function then @xmath .

The Baxter equation ( 7.6 ) can be viewed as a discrete version of the
Schr @xmath dinger equation. We will see below that analogs of both
smooth and steep potential @xmath appear in the quasiclassical solution
of the Baxter equation.

#### 7.2 Different regimes in the @xmath Heisenberg magnet

The @xmath Heisenberg magnet (with spin zero) appeared in particular in
the context of the integrable structures discovered in QCD [ 143 , 144 ,
145 , 221 ] . It was intensively studied in [ 222 , 223 ] . In the
context of the AdS/CFT correspondence the spin 1/2 @xmath Heisenberg
magnet has a particular interest. It describes the one-loop
approximation of the @xmath subsector of the AdS/CFT integrable system.

The Bethe equations for a spin @xmath @xmath magnet are written as
follows:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

All the solutions of these equations are real. The Baxter equation is
written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Baxter equation has a natural parameter which is a magnitude of the
discrete shift. In the normalization chosen here this scale equals one.
We will call it the Baxter scale.

Each solution has its own internal scales given by the typical distances
between the Bethe roots. It is well known that solutions organize
themselves into the cuts. We can distinguish two important scales: the
distance between the roots inside the cut ( @xmath ) and the distance
between the cuts themselves ( @xmath ).

In the thermodynamical limit one typically has a small parameter which
plays the role of @xmath . The solution is supposed to be expanded in
perturbative series within this parameter. It is natural to assume that
for a sufficiently small @xmath and inside one cut the typical
displacement of the Bethe roots within the change of @xmath does not
exceed the distance between the Bethe roots. Under this assumption, the
uniform expansion of the resolvent

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

in the parameter @xmath is possible at the distances from the cut larger
than @xmath .

The smallness of @xmath usually means that the parameter @xmath is
large. If it so, for @xmath we have exponential suppression of the
second term in the l.h.s. of ( 7.6 ). To estimate the magnitude of the
suppression one can approximate

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

We see that the real part of the r.h.s. is positive. Its magnitude
depends on the particular limit that we consider, but at any case for
large @xmath and @xmath the exponential suppression of the second term
in the l.h.s. of ( 7.6 ) is granted. Usually the restriction on @xmath
is weaker.

Under the assumption of the exponential suppression, the Baxter
equations are approximated by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

The equations ( 7.2 ) are equivalent to the linearized equation for the
counting function, see the discussion in section 3.1 .

The relation between the Baxter scale and @xmath can be different
depending on the limit we take.

In the case @xmath , which was studied in [ 224 ] , the typical distance
between roots is much larger than the Baxter scale. Then the
approximation ( 7.2 ) is valid only at the large distances from the real
axis. The perturbative @xmath expansion includes performing the Taylor
series of the type @xmath . If we perform this expansion in ( 7.2 ) then
in the leading order we get the equations that can be also obtained by
the differentiation of ( 5.47 ). This is not surprising since the limit
@xmath is the one studied in Sec. 5.4.2 .

In order to find the corrections to ( 7.2 ) we need to study the
vicinity of the branch point in the scaling limit which leads to the
solution in terms of the Airy function [ 224 ] . This type of limit is
similar to the case of the quantum mechanical particle in a smooth
potential.

In this chapter we consider another case which is analogical to the
particle in a steep potential. In this case the distance between the
Bethe roots is much smaller than the Baxter scale, the equations ( 7.2 )
are valid for any value of @xmath .

This case corresponds to the limit

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

initially discussed in [ 199 ] . We use the notation of [ 24 ] .

The scaling ( 7.10 ) is possible because in the case of a noncompact
spin chain the number of excitations @xmath can be greater than the
length of the spin chain @xmath .

###### The root distribution near the branch cut

Let us take the logarithm of the Bethe equations ( 7.5 ). We obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.11)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The equation ( ) can be interpreted as the equation for the equilibrium
of forces in classical mechanics. For distances between the particles
much larger than one, the interaction between the particles can be
approximated with the Coulomb force @xmath . In this case the density of
the particles is approximated by a square root cut in the leading order
of the large spin limit. This case is realized in the scaling limit
@xmath .

For the scaling ( 7.10 ) we have the opposite situation: the distances
between the particles with the smallest absolute values of rapidities
are much smaller than one. The Coulomb approximation is not applicable.
To describe the distribution of roots in this limit it is better to
represent @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

If we introduce the effective force @xmath , then for the positive roots
equation of the equilibrium will be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath is a smooth function, we immediately get that in the
vicinity of the branch point

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

The last estimation comes from the term @xmath which is dominant in
@xmath for roots close to the origin. The expression ( 7.14 ) is
consistent with the assumption of the small distance between the roots.
It is valid for @xmath which is the case for any finite @xmath .
Equidistant distribution of the roots corresponds to a branch point of
logarithmic type in the continuous limit.

###### Functional equation in the logarithmic scaling regime (7.10).

Let us introduce the resolvent for holes ¹ ¹ 1 In opposite to the
compact case, there are no accompanying roots (in the terminology of
Sec. 1.3 ) in the r.h.s. of 7.6 . Due to this all zeroes of @xmath are
holes. For the same reason there is no string configurations. :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Taking the derivative of the logarithm of ( 7.2 ) we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.16)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

We will consider the ground state in the limit ( 7.10 ). For the ground
state all the holes except two are situated inside the interval @xmath [
222 ] . The two external holes are situated at the position @xmath . All
the Bethe roots are situated between the interval @xmath and external
holes

Let us expand the equation ( 7.2 ) for @xmath at @xmath . We will get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Demanding that the resolvent decreases at infinity, we get:

  -- -- -- --------
           (7.18)
  -- -- -- --------

We see that the external holes define the behavior of the resolvent for
the values of @xmath in the interval @xmath .

The energy can be calculated as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

It was shown in [ 199 ] that in the limit ( 7.4 ) the energy scales
logarithmically:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we introduced the normalization of @xmath which is used in the
AdS/CFT correspondence.

We see from ( 7.18 ) and ( 7.19 ) that the Bethe roots with absolute
value larger than @xmath do not contribute to @xmath . Therefore we can
consider that the asymptotic behavior of the resolvent at infinity is
given by ( 7.18 ).

#### 7.3 Large @xmath solution

In view of the asymptotic behavior ( 7.18 ) it is useful to rescale the
resolvents:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then in the scaling limit ( 7.10 ) we obtain the following functional
equations:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.22)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

with asymptotic behavior given by:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.23)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

These equations are equivalent to the linear integral equation on the
density of holes used in [ 24 , 25 ] .

The scaling function @xmath can be found as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath means that we analytically continue to the point @xmath
from a point @xmath which has a positive imaginary part.

We aim to solve ( 7.3 ) perturbatively for the case of large @xmath . As
we will see below, the position of the branch point, which we denote as
@xmath , scales as @xmath . Therefore the typical scale for the solution
is @xmath and the shift operator can be treated perturbatively:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us consider the equations ( 7.3 ) on the support @xmath of the
density of holes. After multiplying the first one by @xmath and the
second one by @xmath and taking the sum we will get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation can be rewritten in the following form:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.27)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Since @xmath , ( 7.27 ) gives us the possibility to perform the
perturbative expansion in the recursive manner. Of course, the solution
of ( 7.27 ) is not unique. We can always add to it a solution of the
homogeneous equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

The correct solution can be fixed from additional requirements, which we
give below.

###### Leading and subleading orders.

Let us assume the following large @xmath expansion of the resolvent:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

After performing the change of variables @xmath , the term @xmath should
scale as @xmath times a polynomial of @xmath .

A direct calculation gives the first two orders of the perturbative
expansion:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

The solution @xmath is obvious. For @xmath one can do a simple check:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath               (7.31)
                          @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -- -------- --------

The last expression is nonzero only for @xmath , therefore we can
replace @xmath by @xmath .

@xmath has the asymptotics at infinity required in ( 7.3 ). Therefore
all the other terms in the expansion ( 7.29 ) should decrease at least
as @xmath at infinity.

The solution of the homogeneous equation ( 7.28 ) can have singularities
only at @xmath . The general solution of the homogeneous equation which
decreases as @xmath at infinity is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

The index @xmath cannot be equal @xmath , since the first order in which
@xmath can appear is @xmath . The reason is that the expansion ( 7.29 )
is an expansion of an integrable function, which implies that @xmath
should be integrable.

To relate the boundary parameter @xmath with @xmath we have to use ( 7.3
), which for @xmath leads to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

The inverse differential operator means integration. The constant of
integration should be fixed from the parity properties of @xmath . The
result for the leading order of R is:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Indeed, this function is odd if we take the cuts of the square root to
be @xmath which is the support of the density of roots.

To have the correct asymptotics at infinity we have to demand @xmath .
This relation should be corrected at the next orders of the large @xmath
expansion.

#### 7.4 Solution in the double scaling limit

Starting from @xmath we get a nontrivial contribution from ( 7.32 ) and
the solution of ( 7.27 ) becomes ambiguous. To fix this ambiguity, and
this is the key point for the perturbative solution of such kind of
equations, we should consider the initial equations in the double
scaling limit which is defined as follows. We introduce a new variable
@xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

and expand our equation in the powers of @xmath with @xmath fixed. We
get the equations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath has a discontinuity at @xmath , while @xmath has a
discontinuity at @xmath . The weak equivalence to zero means that the
@xmath is proportional to a function @xmath which is analytic at zero.

This equation can be solved explicitly after performing the inverse
Laplace transform

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We should consider the equations ( 7.4 ) order by order in the @xmath
expansion. At each order the function @xmath analytic at zero is just a
polynomial. Its inverse Laplace transform is therefore a sum of delta
function at @xmath and its derivatives. This sum does not affect the
conclusions that we will make in this section. We therefore put @xmath .

Let us investigate analytic properties of the function @xmath .

The resolvent @xmath has only one branch cut on @xmath in @xmath -plane.
Therefore the Laplace transform should be defined for @xmath . We
analytically continue the function @xmath to the region with @xmath by
changing the phase of @xmath and simultaneously rotating the contour of
integration of the Laplace transform such that @xmath . So, if we will
change @xmath in the clockwise direction, the contour of integration
should be rotated in the counterclockwise direction.

To get into the region @xmath the contour of integration passes through
the cut of @xmath . To get the analytical continuation of @xmath to the
other Riemann sheet we use the first equation in ( 7.4 ) to reexpress
@xmath in terms of @xmath . We see for example that when we pass through
the cut @xmath we encounter a branch point at @xmath .

Performing the Laplace transform of the first equation in ( 7.4 ) we see
that the analytical continuation of @xmath by rotation @xmath is given
by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath is analytic for @xmath we deduce that @xmath should have
zeroes for @xmath .

Equivalently we can find that for @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

The conclusion is that @xmath is a function analytic everywhere except
on the axis @xmath where it satisfies the equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

We can fix the solution of this equation if we remark that @xmath should
be expanded in inverse powers of @xmath at infinity. Indeed, from the
structure of the functional equations ( 7.4 ) we conclude that @xmath
should be analytic at @xmath . Therefore the total density @xmath should
be analytic as well. This implies that the expansion of @xmath at @xmath
is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

The inverse Laplace transform of this expansion is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is the stated behavior of @xmath at infinity.

The solution of ( 7.39 ) with the required structure of the zeroes and
behavior at infinity is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

At each order of @xmath expansion the sum @xmath contains only a finite
number of terms and therefore is well defined. For convenience we put
the overall normalization @xmath such that @xmath .

The dependence of @xmath on @xmath of course cannot be understood from
the equation ( 7.39 ). It will become clear when we will show how to
find the coefficients @xmath .

#### 7.5 Higher orders in perturbative expansion

The still unknown coefficients @xmath in ( 7.32 ) and @xmath in ( 7.42 )
are fixed by demanding that the large @xmath expansion ( 7.29 ) and the
expansion ( 7.42 ) in the double scaling limit match in the intermediate
regime. The expansion ( 7.29 ) in the double scaling regime ( 9.27 )
organizes at each order of @xmath as a large @xmath expansion, therefore
it should match with the Laplace transform of the small @xmath expansion
of ( 7.42 ).

Let us see how this works for @xmath . The general solution of ( 7.27 )
at this order is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

Reexpansion of @xmath in the double scaling regime is then given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

Correspondingly, the Laplace transform of the small @xmath expansion of
( 7.42 ) is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

The first two terms in ( 7.44 ) are analytic at @xmath . Demanding the
weak equivalence between ( 7.44 ) and ( 7.45 ) in the sense of ( 7.4 )
we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

To obtain the expansion ( 7.48 ) we need also @xmath . The solution at
this order is given in appendix D .

To relate the parameters @xmath and @xmath we find the resolvent @xmath
from ( 7.33 ) and demand that it has the correct asymptotic behavior (
7.3 ). This leads to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

The scaling function @xmath can be found from ( 7.24 ). In terms of
@xmath this is a rather complicated expression containing @xmath as
well. But in terms of the parameter @xmath it significantly simplifies:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

This expansion matches with numerical analysis in [ 220 , V1 ] .

These three orders of large @xmath expansion lie in the BMN-like window
of the AdS/CFT. More precisely, as we conclude from [ 209 ] the large
@xmath expansion of the generalized scaling function @xmath has the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this expansion the coefficients @xmath do not depend on the coupling
constant. The coefficients @xmath define the expansion ( 7.48 ). The
coefficients @xmath appear in the large @xmath expansion of the two-loop
correction to the generalized scaling function and were not calculated
here.

@xmath and @xmath can be found respectively from tree [ 173 , 174 ] and
one loop [ 209 ] calculations on the string side. In [ V1 ] @xmath was
found from the strong coupling solution of the BES/FRS equation up to
two loops. All findings are in agreement with ( 7.48 ).

### Chapter 8 Generalized scaling function at strong coupling

#### 8.1 BES/FRS equation and different regimes at strong coupling

In the previous chapter we discussed the energy of the ground state of
the @xmath Heisenberg ferromagnet in various regimes of the
thermodynamic limit. We saw that the answer depends strongly on the
relation of two parameters - the twist @xmath and the number of magnons
@xmath . For @xmath the energy scales logarithmically with a prefactor
@xmath , @xmath . One expects [ 24 ] that the logarithmic scaling of the
anomalous dimension

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

in the limit with fixed @xmath takes place at any finite value of the
coupling constant @xmath . In section 5.4.3 we discussed how @xmath can
be used for the test of integrability in AdS/CFT. Now more technical
details would be given.

The Heisenberg ferromagnet describes the spectrum of the dilatation
operator only at one loop. The all-loop result may be obtained from the
conjectured Beisert-Staudacher asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. In the @xmath
sector it reduces to the one integral equation known as the BES/FRS
equation. Its derivation is completely analogous to the derivation of
the one loop equation discussed above. This equation was initially
derived in [ 24 ] and also in [ 25 ] . In our notations it reads [ V1 ]
:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.2)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

The kernels @xmath are defined by [ KSV2 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is given by ( 6.71 ).

The asymptotic behavior of the resolvents at infinity is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.5)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Based on the all-loop integral equation ( 8.1 ), we can relate the
generalized scaling function @xmath and the parameter @xmath in ( 8.1 )
¹ ¹ 1 This property was initially remarked in [ 26 ] . . Indeed, the
anomalous dimension is given by the formula

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.6)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Expanding the BES/FRS equation ( 8.1 ) at infinity, we obtain for the
coefficients in front of @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

Comparing ( 8.6 ) and ( 8.7 ), we conclude that the generalized scaling
function can be found as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

Note that the derivation of this relation includes expansion of the
kernel @xmath at large @xmath , therefore it is essentially based on the
higher order corrections to the one-loop integral equation.

The resolvents @xmath and @xmath in the BES/FRS equation have two types
of branch points. The first type of branch points has ”kinematic” origin
- these are branch points of the inverse Zhukovsky map @xmath which is
singular at @xmath . The ”kinematic” branch points are located at @xmath
. The branch points of the second type are located at @xmath , where
@xmath is the end of the root distribution.

It is natural to assume that the only nonanalyticities in the
generalized scaling function appear at the values of @xmath and @xmath
for which the branch points of different types collide. For real finite
@xmath and @xmath the collision is impossible. However, if we take into
account complex values of these parameters, the collision is possible.
Using this observation, we can determine in particular the radius of
convergence of the weak coupling expansion of @xmath . Indeed, for
@xmath we have @xmath . The kinematic branch point touches the origin
when @xmath . Therefore, the radius of convergence equals @xmath . This
observation coincides with the numerical prediction in [ 21 ] .

To investigate analytical properties of the generalized scaling function
at strong coupling it is useful to introduce the rescaled coordinate
@xmath . At strong coupling all the kinematic points condense into two
points @xmath that are situated on the real axis. Therefore we will
potentially have different regimes depending where the branch point
@xmath is situated: inside the interval @xmath , outside it, or at the
finite distance from the point @xmath .

###### Finite-twist operators and small perturbations.

This is a regime in which @xmath is situated inside the interval @xmath
. In the particular case when @xmath (and therefore @xmath ) the
generalized scaling function reduces to twice the cusp anomalous
dimension

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

To obtain a nonzero @xmath inside the interval @xmath the parameter
@xmath should scale as @xmath , so it is exponentially small. As was
shown in the works of Alday and Maldacena [ 49 ] and Basso and
Korchemsky [ 34 ] , this regime is effectively described by the dynamics
of the @xmath sigma model. The quantity @xmath can be viewed as the
vacuum energy and @xmath is identified with the energy of the @xmath
sigma model. The physical motivation for this particular description was
discussed in Sec. 5.4.3 . In Sec. 8.3 we give a derivation, alternative
to the one in [ 34 ] , of the integral equation for the @xmath sigma
model from the BES/FRS integral equation.

###### The limit with @xmath.

In the large @xmath limit with @xmath fixed the branch point is situated
outside the interval @xmath . The position of branch point at @xmath is
given by [ 30 , 48 ] :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath for any positive @xmath . Therefore if we perform the
perturbation series as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

each function @xmath should be analytical function of @xmath . This
regime was a subject of investigation of [ V1 ] . In Sec. 8.4 we discuss
the results of this investigation.

###### Intermediate regime.

Finally, let us consider the regime when the distance between the branch
point @xmath and the Zhukovsky branch point @xmath is of order of @xmath
. This limit should describe the transition between the @xmath sigma
model which is realized in the case @xmath and the string perturbative
regime @xmath . From the @xmath sigma model we know that @xmath behaves
as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

Performing the small @xmath expansion of the expression of ( 8.10 ) we
get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore if we introduce the parameter @xmath and consider the strong
coupling limit with @xmath fixed we can expect that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath interpolating smoothly between the asymptotics ( 8.12 ) and
( 8.14 ). This observation is further supported by the known analytic
structure of the BES/FRS equation: we do not encounter new singular
points while varying @xmath .

The study of this regime was not done and may be the subject of a future
research.

#### 8.2 Cusp anomalous dimension

The BES/FRS equation for @xmath (and therefore @xmath ) reduces to the
BES equation. This is the very equation in which the all-loop proposal
for the BES/BHL dressing phase initially appeared. The cusp anomalous
dimension which can be found from the solution of the BES equation is a
nontrivial quantity and is accessible up to four loops on the gauge side
and up to two loops on the string side. The perturbative recursive
solution of the BES equation at strong coupling was found, after a
number of initial attempts [ 26 ] , [ 29 , 27 ] , [ 28 , KSV1 ] , [ 30 ,
31 ] , in [ 32 ] , [ KSV2 ] . Here we will show that the method used for
the solution is in fact the same as the one used in the previous
chapter. Our analysis follows closely [ KSV2 ] with a few improvements.

The BES equation reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the asymptotic conditions on @xmath given by ( 8.1 ). It turns out
to be useful to introduce the resolvents ² ² 2 In [ KSV2 ] we used a
shifted definition:

@xmath

@xmath and @xmath in the upper half of the @xmath -plane by the
following equations valid for any value of the coupling constant:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.16)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.17)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.18)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

There are combinations @xmath and @xmath of @xmath and @xmath with
simple analytical properties. They are defined in the upper half plane
by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.19)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.20)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

and further by analytical continuation ³ ³ 3 Similar linear combinations
in the Fourier space were initially proposed in [ 32 ] . .

The functions @xmath and @xmath have square root type branching at the
points @xmath inherited from @xmath and @xmath . If to choose the branch
cut to be on @xmath for @xmath and on @xmath for @xmath then one can
show from the definitions of @xmath and @xmath and the property ( 8.32 )
of the kernels @xmath that @xmath and @xmath are analytic outside these
cuts. Analytical continuation through the cuts reveals the branch points
at @xmath on the next sheet.

The resolvents @xmath and @xmath are related in the upper half plane as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath and @xmath have discontinuities on the complementary cuts,
( 8.21 ) is very similar to the integral equations which follows from
the Baxter equations (for example like ( 7.2 )).

The resolvents @xmath perturbatively at strong coupling, in the regime
@xmath with @xmath fixed, satisfy the equations [ KSV2 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

We see that the BES equation reduces to a very simple Riemann-Hilbert
problem. Its most general solution is given by:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the formula ( 8.8 ) and the definitions of the resolvents, we
derive that the scaling function can be expressed in terms of @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

Similarly to the discussion in chapter 7 , to fix the coefficients
@xmath we should solve ( 8.21 ) in the double scaling limit

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

and then demand the compatibility of this solution with ( 8.23 ). The
demand that the double scaling limit exists explains the presence of
@xmath factor in ( 8.23 ). The coefficients @xmath should be bounded at
@xmath .

The solution in the double scaling limit can be most easily found if to
apply the inverse Laplace transform:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

The study of the analytical properties of @xmath and @xmath , see the
discussion near Fig. 7.1 , leads to the conclusion that @xmath is
analytic everywhere except on the negative real axis and @xmath is
analytic everywhere except on the positive real axis.

The inverse Laplace transform of ( 8.21 ) has the following form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation and the equation for @xmath , which can be similarly
derived, imply that @xmath and @xmath have monodromy of order four
around zero ⁴ ⁴ 4 We can see this also in the following way. The
monodromy of @xmath around zero is inherited from the monodromy of
@xmath around infinity. At large values of @xmath the solution in the
double scaling limit should match with the perturbative solution ( 8.23
). The monodromy of the latter is of order four, as it follows from (
8.22 ). .

Another consequence of ( 8.27 ) is the following. Let us analytically
continue this equation to @xmath by the path that does not cross the
real axis. Then, since @xmath is analytic for @xmath , @xmath should
have zeroes at @xmath and may have poles only at @xmath .

Finally, @xmath has a square root branch point at @xmath , same as the
square root branch point for @xmath at finite @xmath . This implies that
at @xmath @xmath is expanded in inverse half-integer powers of @xmath .

The most general solution for @xmath with stated above properties is
given by

  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      @xmath      (8.28)
     @xmath      @xmath      
  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------

The requirement of compatibility of the solutions ( 8.23 ) and ( 8.28 )
fixes unambiguously all the coefficients @xmath and @xmath . This
requirement in particular implies the presence of an overall factor
@xmath in ( 8.28 ) and that @xmath should be bounded at @xmath . The
algorithmic procedure for calculation of @xmath and @xmath , realized
with the help of Mathematica , is presented in appendix E.2 .

As a result, at first three orders of the strong coupling expansion we
get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

This result was initially obtained in [ 32 ] . The derivation there
contained number of assumptions which we were able to prove in [ KSV2 ]
confirming that result. The obtained expansion ( 8.29 ) coincides with
the two-loop string prediction [ 225 , 186 ] . This was the first
two-loop test at strong coupling of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz
proposal.

#### 8.3 @xmath sigma model

The appearance of the @xmath sigma model in a special regime of the
AdS/CFT system can be understood from the point of view of the string
theory. If we consider a folded string solution, then the centrifugal
forces make all the fluctuations on the AdS space, as well all the
fermion excitations massive. Therefore the low-energy excitations in the
theory should be described by the fluctuating modes that live on @xmath
, i.e. by the @xmath sigma model. The mass of the AdS fluctuating modes
determines the energy scale below which the @xmath sigma model
approximation is applicable.

We can test the @xmath sigma model regime if we consider the string
which moves around equator of the @xmath in addition to the rotation in
@xmath , and therefore is described by the @xmath angular momentum
@xmath and the @xmath angular momentum @xmath . This is the
configuration which is described by the @xmath equation.

In order to stay in the @xmath sigma model regime, we should put @xmath
. More precisely, @xmath should be at most of the order @xmath . We
again come back to a parameter @xmath . As we will see below, the
density ⁵ ⁵ 5 number per unit volume of holes of the BES/FRS equation is
proportional to @xmath .

The @xmath sigma model, through the mechanism of dimensional
transmutation, acquires a nontrivial mass scale @xmath which should
depend on the coupling constant by the law

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

A very nontrivial check of the integrability in the AdS/CFT
correspondence would be to identify the @xmath particles with holes of
the BES/FRS equation as far as we stay at the energies much lower than
the masses of fluctuations in AdS. This regime is possible when @xmath
is finite. In this case we come back to the scaling law ( 8.12 ) for the
strong coupling behavior of @xmath .

The identification of the BES/FRS holes and the excitations of the
@xmath sigma model was done by Basso and Korchemsky in [ 34 ] . They
showed that in the regime ( 8.12 ) the BES/FRS equation can be reduced
to the integral equation obeyed by the particles of the @xmath sigma
model. Here we will give a different derivation of their result.

Let us consider in addition to the BES/FRS equation ( 8.1 ) in the
u.h.p, the BES/FRS equation in the l.h.p. It reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the meaning of notation @xmath see appendix A .

In our derivation we will rely on the properties of the kernels @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

and on the fact that @xmath and @xmath are odd functions.

Considering the BES/FRS equation for @xmath we can make the following
transformations:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
                       @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.33)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Let us introduce an additional notation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using this notation we can rewrite

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

Summarizing, we can rewrite the BES/FRS equation in the upper and the
lower half planes as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.36)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Let us consider the interval @xmath . In this interval @xmath . We
therefore can derive

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

We see that remarkably @xmath is almost decoupled from @xmath . In the
l.h.s. of ( 8.37 ) we recognize the l.h.s. of perturbative functional
equation for the @xmath sigma model ( 9.24 ).

The exact equation for the @xmath sigma model is written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us then take the l.h.s. of the last equation and evaluate it using (
8.3 ). After some algebra we will get

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.39)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The functions @xmath and @xmath have the same periodicity as @xmath and
branch points at the positions @xmath . Therefore at the leading order
we expect

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

We see that this gives the correct integral equation for the @xmath
sigma model.

The calculation of the coefficient @xmath is tricky and was done
explicitly in [ 34 ] . It is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (8.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore we see that the induced mass of the @xmath sigma model has a
correct RG behavior (prefactor @xmath ).

#### 8.4 Connection to the perturbative string theory calculations.

We have already discussed the limits which lead @xmath at strong
coupling. The limit which leads to @xmath at strong coupling is @xmath
with @xmath fixed. The interest for this limit, which was studied in [
V1 ] , is motivated by the fact that naively the expansion ( 8.11 ) can
be directly compared with the string theory results. However, the order
of limits in calculation of ( 8.11 ) is different from that used on the
string theory side. On the string theory side the logarithmic scaling
regime is attained in the following two-step limiting procedure:

  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      (8.42)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------

To compare, ( 8.11 ) is obtained using the following order of limits

  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      @xmath      
     @xmath      @xmath      (8.43)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------

There is a qualitative difference between two limiting orders ( 8.4 )
and ( 8.4 ), which may become important starting from two loops. It is
shown at the r.h.s. of Fig. 8.1 .

The limiting procedure ( 8.4 ) is organized in a way that the distance
between the Bethe roots in the vicinity of the branch point is larger
than the Baxter scale. Therefore in the vicinity of the branch point we
need both terms in the Baxter equation and approximation in which the
BES/FRS equation was derived is inapplicable. This situation is similar
to the WKB solution of quantum mechanics in a smooth potential.

In the limiting procedure ( 8.4 ) the distance between the Bethe roots
in the vicinity of the branch point is much smaller than the Baxter
scale. This is similar to the WKB solution in quantum mechanics with a
steep function at the turning point.

This qualitative difference is absent in the case when we consider the
strong coupling regime with @xmath . As shown at the l.h.s. of Fig. 8.1
, the density of roots is always large in this case.

In [ V1 ] the discrepancy at two-loop level was found between ( 8.11 )
and the solution in [ 48 ] of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz in the order
of limits ( 8.4 ). We however were not able to show explicitly that this
discrepancy is due to the explained qualitative difference between two
cases.

We see therefore that there are reasons to doubt the possibility of
application of the BES/FRS equation, at least without modifications, for
the comparison of the Bethe Ansatz and perturbative string results. The
calculation in [ 48 ] was done using the order of limits ( 8.4 ) and
therefore should match the string theory prediction [ 187 ] . However,
there is a discrepancy at the two-loop level.

Another possibility to check the results of [ 48 , 187 ] was proposed in
[ 37 ] based on the @xmath sigma model regime. The two-loop prediction
of [ 37 ] matched that of [ 48 ] . This matching should be however
better understood, since the order of limits used in [ 37 ] was
different from ( 8.4 ) (and from ( 8.4 )).

### Chapter 9 Mass gap in integrable sigma models

#### 9.1 Formulation of the problem

Another important application of the techniques developed in previous
chapters is the perturbative solution of integral equations which appear
in two-dimensional integrable sigma models.

Two-dimensional nonlinear sigma models are often considered as toy
models for QCD. They share with QCD the property of the asymptotic
freedom [ 226 ] . Although these theories do not have dimensionful
parameters on the classical level, they acquire a dynamical mass scale
on the quantum level via the dimensional transmutation mechanism. We
will call this mass scale @xmath .

The symmetry group @xmath of the target space of the sigma model is the
analog of the QCD gauge group. The sigma models with the target space
being a coset manifold @xmath are classically integrable [ 168 ] . It is
believed that when @xmath is simple the integrability is preserved on
the quantum level. Examples of such quantum integrable theories are
@xmath vector sigma model and @xmath principal chiral field (PCF) model.
@xmath sigma model is an example of the theory which is integrable on
the classical but not on the quantum level.

As in QCD, the sigma models can be studied perturbatively at scales much
larger than the dynamical mass scale. In the infrared regime the
perturbative description is not applicable. Instead, it is possible to
solve these theories exactly. For example, large @xmath solutions of
such models as @xmath and @xmath sigma models were found in [ 71 , 72 ,
227 , 228 ] . These solutions showed that the excitations are described
on the quantum level by massive particles. Since @xmath is the only
dimensionful parameter of the theory, the mass of the particles should
be proportional to it:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

If to assume that the description in terms of particles is appropriate
for finite values of @xmath then quantum integrable sigma models can be
solved by the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz in the infinite volume [ 7 ] , as
we discussed in the second chapter.

In this chapter we will explain how to determine the coefficient of
proportionality @xmath in ( 9.1 ) for the @xmath sigma model at finite
@xmath . Although we will consider only this particular case, most of
the statements can be applied for any sigma model solvable by the
asymptotic Bethe Ansatz.

The idea of determination of the coefficient @xmath is not new. It goes
back to [ 38 , 39 ] . We refer also to [ 229 ] for an overview. The mass
gap ( 9.1 ) was found in [ 38 , 39 ] numerically with a precision that
allowed to guess the analytical expression. Our contribution is to give
an analytical derivation of the mass gap ¹ ¹ 1 In [ 230 ] it was stated
that Balog had provided such analytical derivation (see ref.[19] there).
His result was however not published. .

The determination of the mass gap is not the only issue of this chapter.
We will also discuss the renorm-group behavior and Borel summability
properties of the @xmath sigma model. This will bring us an additional
evidence that the Bethe Ansatz is a proper description of this QFT.

###### Sigma-model in an external field

Let us consider an asymptotically free model with a running coupling
constant @xmath that satisfies the Gell-Man--Low equation ² ² 2 We may
choose @xmath equal to @xmath from ( 2.1 ). This is however not at all
obligatory. In fact, below we will make another choice which is related
to @xmath via the finite renormalization ( 9.41 ). :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

The dynamically generated scale @xmath is the RG invariant which can be
built from ( 9.2 ):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

The quantity @xmath is invariant under finite renormalizations of the
coupling constant given by the transformations of the type

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

This scheme independent object @xmath is an important prediction of the
perturbation theory.

From ( 9.3 ) we can see that the mass gap ( 9.1 ) cannot be found by
perturbative means only. Therefore integrability, or another
nonperturbative description, is needed. A typical way for identification
of the coefficient @xmath is the comparison of the perturbative field
theory prediction with the prediction of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz.
Since the theory is asymptotically free, we have to introduce a large
scale in order to insure that we are in the perturbative regime. A
strong external field @xmath coupled to one of the charges @xmath of the
system is often used for this purpose. @xmath sigma model in the
presence of the external field was initially considered in the works of
Polyakov and Wiegmann [ 68 , 231 ] . The thermodynamics of the system,
which we consider at zero temperature, can be described by the free
energy which is a minimum with respect to the value of the charge @xmath
of

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath is the energy of the system.

@xmath sigma model contains only one type of particles that belong to
the vector multiplet of the @xmath group. We chose a charge @xmath which
counts the number of particles polarized in a particular direction. Then
@xmath plays the role of the chemical potential. For @xmath larger than
the mass gap a condensate of equally polarized particles is created.

In the limit of infinite volume @xmath we should speak about intensive
quantities: the density of the particles @xmath , the free energy
density @xmath , and the energy density @xmath . These intensive
quantities are related as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

The free energy density @xmath is a function of @xmath . Instead, @xmath
, which is the Legendre transform of @xmath , is a function of @xmath .

Perturbative field theory predicts the following asymptotic weak
coupling expansion of the energy density:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the running coupling constant @xmath is evaluated at the scale
@xmath . The ratio @xmath is exponentially small in terms of the
coupling constant.

The dependence of @xmath on @xmath can be figured out from the condition
@xmath and decomposition ( 9.7 ). It is given by the expansion

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

It is useful to think about the coupling constant as the function of
@xmath and to introduce the corresponding beta-function

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

From ( 9.8 ) it follows that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The explicit value of the coefficients @xmath depends on the computation
scheme which is used and on the definition of the coupling constant. The
energy of the @xmath sigma model at tree level and its one-loop
correction were calculated in [ 38 , 39 ] ³ ³ 3 More precisely, the free
energy was found. Then we can make the Legendre transform to obtain the
expression for the energy. . The two-loop correction was found in [ 37 ]
⁴ ⁴ 4 This work contains a very good pedagogical explanation about how
the perturbative calculations are done. . The calculations were done in
the @xmath scheme. With the coupling constant defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

the first three coefficients @xmath were found to be

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

The definition ( 9.11 ) of the coupling constant is the same as in [ 37
] , where it was called @xmath . The reason to use such definition is
that it leads to a particularly simple form of the coefficients @xmath ,
as we discuss below.

We can rewrite the expansion ( 9.7 ) in terms of the ratio @xmath only:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.13)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The idea of [ 38 , 39 ] to calculate the mass gap ( 9.1 ) is based on
the fact that the energy of the considered system can be also found from
the Bethe Ansatz. Instead of @xmath , the solution should depend on the
ratio of the density and the mass of the particles, since the mass of
the particles serves as an input for the construction of the Bethe
Ansatz. One should expect the expression of the following form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.14)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Comparison of ( 9.13 ) and ( 9.14 ) gives us a possibility to find
@xmath in ( 9.1 ). The expansions ( 9.13 ) and ( 9.14 ) contain also
another valuable information. They contain the invariant ratio @xmath .
Therefore we can verify that the Bethe Ansatz reproduces a correct
renorm-group dynamics of the model. It is a nontrivial check of the
bootstrap approach. A priory , the Bethe Ansatz does not contain
coupling constant at all. But it turns out to be useful to introduce a
coupling constant in order to rewrite ( 9.14 ) in terms of the power
series of the coupling constant (like ( 9.7 )).

###### Integral equation

Since only the states with a certain polarization are excited, the
nested levels of the Bethe Ansatz are turned off. Therefore in the large
volume limit the system with a given density of particles @xmath is
described by the one integral equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (9.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here @xmath is a density of the Bethe roots distribution. The boundary
@xmath of the Bethe roots distribution is the value of rapidity up to
which the Fermi sea is filled. This value should be found from the
normalization condition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

The energy density of the system is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

The energy density @xmath depends on the particle density @xmath through
the parameter @xmath . Our goal is to find this parametric dependence
for large @xmath , or equivalently large @xmath .

One can see (from numerical solution for example) that the density of
roots grows when it approaches the points @xmath . Therefore we can use
the methods explained in the previous chapters to perturbatively solve
the integral equation. The discussed below solution is the extended
version of the work [ V2 ] .

The @xmath -matrix is given by ratio of the gamma functions. Using the
formal equivalence ⁵ ⁵ 5 In ( 2.16 ) we already used such notation.
Moreover, there we defined the r.h.s. of ( 9.18 ) as the gamma function.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

and introducing the resolvent

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

we can rewrite the integral equation ( 9.1 ) in an elegant form:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here the shift operator is defined by @xmath and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 9.2 Perturbative expansion

Let us act on ( 9.20 ) with the operator @xmath , which is well defined
operation. The r.h.s. of ( 9.20 ) will vanish and we are left with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

The action of the shift operator in this notation is understood as an
analytical continuation.

If to consider this equation perturbatively in the regime

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

the overall operator @xmath can be dropped in the perturbative expansion
by the following reason. This operator is perturbatively understood as a
power series in @xmath . Integrating the obtained equation in each order
of the perturbation theory we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

up to a constant of integration. However, this constant is zero since
@xmath is an odd function.

The equation ( 9.24 ) can be solved perturbatively. Its most general
solution is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . The perturbative meaning of the expansion ( 9.25 ) is
most easily seen in terms of the variable @xmath .

The coefficients @xmath are not all independent. The coefficients for
the terms which contain logarithms can be defined uniquely through the
other coefficients using equation ( 9.24 ). However, below we will show
a more efficient way to fix them.

The solution ( 9.25 ) gives us the value for the particle density from
the residue of the resolvent at infinity:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 9.3 Solution in the double scaling limit

To fix all the coefficients @xmath , we follow exactly the same
procedure as we did in the previous chapters. Namely, we consider a
double scaling limit

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

and perform the inverse Laplace transform defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

The double scaling limit of ( 9.20 ) and further its inverse Laplace
transform give the following equation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (9.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here we neglected the exponentially small terms since our goal is to
find the asymptotic large @xmath expansion. Neglecting these terms
allows reexpressing the energy in terms of @xmath . Indeed,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

The study of the analytical structure of the resolvent goes similarly to
study in chapter 7 (note that the role of @xmath and @xmath are
exchanged in these two cases). The conclusion is that:

-   @xmath is analytic everywhere except on the negative real axis,

-   For @xmath @xmath has a branch cut. The monodromy around the branch
    point @xmath is given by the equation:

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.31)
      -- -------- -- --------

-   @xmath has an infinite set of poles and zeroes on the negative real
    axes. The position of poles and zeroes is such that all the poles
    and zeroes of @xmath for @xmath are canceled out, except for the
    pole at @xmath , which is a singularity of the r.h.s. of ( 9.3 ).

-   The asymptotic behavior of @xmath at large @xmath is given by

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (9.32)
      -- -------- -- --------

The solution of ( 9.3 ) which satisfies these properties is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.33)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The dependence of @xmath on @xmath is not a consequence of ( 9.3 ). It
comes from the comparison of ( 9.3 ) and ( 9.25 ). @xmath contains only
finite number of terms at each order of @xmath expansion. Therefore the
solution ( 9.3 ) is well defined.

To fix all the coefficients @xmath and @xmath , we should consider (
9.25 ) in the double scaling limit. In this limit the expansion
organizes at each order of @xmath as a @xmath expansion. This expansion
should match with the Laplace transform of the small @xmath expansion of
@xmath . This requirement uniquely fixes all the coefficients. We used
Mathematica to obtain first 25 orders of the perturbative expansion. The
routine for this calculation is given in appendix E.3 .

#### 9.4 Results for the mass gap coefficient and the RG dynamics.

At the leading and subleading orders the energy and particle densities
are given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

By explicit solution of this parametric dependence and comparison with (
9.13 ) we get the correct value of the mass gap known in the literature
and given by [ 38 , 39 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here the @xmath -parameter is defined in the @xmath scheme.

We would like to note that the importance of the solution is not only in
finding the coefficient of proportionality. The expression for the
energy density in terms of the parameter @xmath contains both @xmath and
@xmath terms. The fact that we can cancel all the double logarithm terms
by introducing a proper coupling constant is very nontrivial. Moreover,
this cancelation is only possible if the coupling constant has a
beta-function with the correct ratio @xmath predicted by the quantum
field theory. This shows that the Bethe Ansatz correctly reproduces the
renorm-group dynamics of the model.

The presence of the CDD factors ⁶ ⁶ 6 The crossing and unitarity
equations constrain the scalar factor in the scattering matrix up to a
multiplier known as the CDD factor. This factor can be fixed if the
complete particle content of the theory is known. would change this
renorm-group dynamics. Therefore this calculation also serves as a
verification of the assumption about the particle content of the theory.

#### 9.5 Borel summability

The recursive procedure allows us to find analytical expression for the
first @xmath orders of the perturbation theory. We are able therefore to
analyze the large order behavior of the coefficients of the asymptotic
expansion. Comparison of the large order behavior that we get from the
Bethe Ansatz with the prediction of the quantum field theory gives us an
additional check of the validity of the Bethe Ansatz description of the
@xmath sigma model.

Let us briefly recall the basic facts about asymptotic series.
Typically, a small coupling expansion in a quantum field theory is an
asymptotic expansion with zero radius of convergence. Probably the only
known example of the convergent series is when models are considered in
the ’t Hooft planar limit.

In opposite to the case with convergent series, there is no bijection
between the function and the asymptotic series. Although the asymptotic
expansion of the function is uniquely defined, the inverse is not true.
It is often postulated that the function which corresponds to a given
asymptotic expansion is given by the Borel ressumation of the asymptotic
series.

Suppose that this series is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Borel sum of this series is defined by the integral

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

The integrand is given by the series which is convergent provided that
@xmath grow at most factorially. In the most interesting cases @xmath
grow exactly in factorial way. Therefore the series has a finite radius
of convergence. The integrand in ( 9.37 ) is defined using the
analytical continuation of the function

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is well defined by its series expansion for a sufficiently small
@xmath .

Let us suppose that @xmath has a singularity (we will consider only
poles for simplicity) at @xmath with @xmath . Then we can choose
different contours of integration, as it shown in Fig. 9.1 .

Different choices of the contours obviously lead to different functions
@xmath . However, these functions have the same asymptotic expansion. We
see that the Borel transform is an ambiguous procedure in this case. A
series ( 9.36 ) with such properties is called non-Borel-summable.

When all the singularities of @xmath are situated to the left from the
imaginary axes, we can uniquely choose the contour of integration. In
this case the Borel summation is the unambiguous procedure. An
asymptotic series for which Borel transform is uniquely defined is
called Borel-summable.

The large order behavior of the asymptotic expansion gives a valuable
information about the existence/absence of singularities in the Borel
plane. If the large order behavior of the coefficients @xmath is
approximated by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

then @xmath has a singularity at @xmath . If the sign of @xmath is
positive, we get a non-Borel-summable theory. Therefore sign oscillation
of the asymptotic expansion is a necessary condition for the Borel
summability. Of course, this condition is not at all sufficient.

Let us now investigate what is the asymptotic behavior of the
coefficients in the @xmath sigma model. The large @xmath behavior for
the coefficients @xmath is approximated by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

The qualitative behavior of the coefficients @xmath is different for
large and small values of @xmath . For @xmath , and therefore @xmath ,
we have @xmath , so we have a sign oscillating series. We will see below
that this is in agreement with the observation that exactly at @xmath
the asymptotic expansion is Borel-summable.

For sufficiently small @xmath the coefficients of the series become
positive. So, @xmath for @xmath and @xmath for @xmath . We see that at
least for sufficiently small @xmath the series is non-Borel-summable.
The Borel ambiguity is of order @xmath as it should be from the field
theory point of view (see ( 9.13 )).

For other values of @xmath the behavior of the coefficients is more
complicated. It seems that they reflect the concurrence between two
singularities at @xmath in the Borel plane.

For @xmath the asymptotic behavior of @xmath is estimated by @xmath ,
where @xmath is positive. This shows that we have an additional
singularity in the Borel plane at @xmath . This singularity determines
the asymptotic behavior of the coefficients for @xmath .

Let us compare our results with the predictions of the quantum field
theory. In quantum field theory there are two sources of the
singularities in the Borel plane: instantons and renormalons. Both of
them are present in the @xmath sigma model.

###### Instantons.

Instanton is defined as a solution of the equations of motion in the
imaginary time with finite value of the Euclidian action. As was
observed by Lipatov [ 232 ] , there are singularities in the Borel plane
related to instanton solutions. We will apply the method of [ 232 ] to
find the position of these singularities.

The relation between the coupling constant @xmath that we use and @xmath
that was used in ( 2.1 ) is the following:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

For our discussion it would be sufficient only the leading order. Let us
consider a physical quantity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

The @xmath -th order of the asymptotic expansion of @xmath can be found
from the correspondent residue under the functional integral

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the saddle point approximation at large values of @xmath , both
for @xmath and @xmath , we can estimate that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the extremal value of the action. The smallest nonzero
value of @xmath is @xmath . A particular instanton solution which
corresponds to this value is the following: @xmath , and @xmath form the
instanton solution for the @xmath sigma model with topological charge
equal one, @xmath for @xmath . Of course, we should integrate over all
solutions of this type. This will lead to a common multiplier in ( 9.44
) that does not affect the position of the Borel singularity. Higher
instanton solutions are built analogically. For the @xmath -th instanton
solution @xmath .

Substituting @xmath to ( 9.44 ) we obtain the positions of the Borel
singularities related to the instantons:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

The instanton solutions are not stable for @xmath ⁷ ⁷ 7 To show this we
can consider the one-parametric deformation @xmath , @xmath , where
@xmath is a constant unit vector which satisfies the condition @xmath .
The value of the action, @xmath interpolates monotonously between @xmath
and @xmath . . Naively we could think that an unstable solution is not a
local minimum of the action and therefore it does not lead to
nonperturbative corrections. However, there are examples from the
quantum mechanics which show that the situation is less trivial and that
unstable instantons may lead to the singularities in the Borel plane.

From our explicit calculation we observed for @xmath a leading
singularity in the Borel plane equal to @xmath . It is natural to
identify it with the instanton solution. For @xmath this singularity, if
present, is not a leading one and therefore cannot be seen from our
analysis. Thus we cannot conclude about the presence or absence of
nonperturbative corrections related to instantons for @xmath .

###### Renormalons.

Renormalon ambiguities do not correspond to any physical effects but
reflect an ambiguity in the definition of the asymptotic perturbative
expansion. It is believed that the ambiguities related to renormalons
can be fixed by proper definition of the subleading terms in the
operator product expansion. For a review of the subject see for example
[ 233 ] .

The renormalons in the @xmath sigma model were studied by David [ 234 ,
235 ] . For @xmath the @xmath sigma model is just an @xmath -component
gaussian field theory. It contains only UV renormalons at positions
@xmath with @xmath being negative integer. The @xmath corrections to the
large @xmath solutions suggest that for finite @xmath both UV and IR
renormalons are likely to be present. The IR renormalons are situated at
positions @xmath with @xmath being positive integer.

In view of this field theory prediction we can naturally interpret our
results in the following way. For @xmath we observe that the asymptotic
expansion is governed by the leading UV renormalon singularity at @xmath
. For finite @xmath there are two leading singularities: the UV
renormalon at @xmath and the IR renormalon at @xmath . The concurrence
of them is reflected in the nonsymmetrical with respect to the real axis
oscillating behavior of the coefficients of the expansion.

We see that the results about the large order behavior obtained from the
Bethe Ansatz are in accordance with the predictions of the field theory.
We got a new confirmation that the Bethe Ansatz correctly describes the
@xmath sigma model.

### Conclusions and discussions

The study of the AdS/CFT correspondence gave us an example of integrable
system with remarkable properties and posed new questions to answer in
the field of quantum integrable systems. In this thesis we described the
AdS/CFT integrable system in analogy with known integrable systems based
on the rational @xmath -matrix.

We saw that the symmetry group is always behind all the equations that
describe rational integrable systems, whether these are Bethe Ansatz
equations, fusion Hirota equations or integral equations for the
resolvents of the density functions.

It seems that the deepest way to describe an integrable system is to
consider the Hirota equations ( @xmath -system). Imposing different
requirements on the analytical structure of the transfer matrices we can
obtain different integrable systems, not necessarily based on the
rational @xmath -matrix. In this way the AdS/CFT system can be also
obtained.

It is not always simple to deal with the Hirota equations due to their
quadratic structure. We saw however that the @xmath -system is defined,
roughly speaking, by the ”exponentiation” of the functional equations
for the resolvents (compare ( 3.26 ) and ( 3.50 )). This resembles to
the description of the Lie group via its Lie algebra. The functional
equations for the resolvents are linear and are simple to investigate.
Therefore we may consider them as an indicator of the possible relations
among different integrable theories and then probably raise this
relation to the level of @xmath -systems.

For example, we saw that the structure of the functional equations for
the resolvents in the @xmath XXX spin chain is simple and is defined by
two deformed Cartan matrices (one for @xmath algebra and another for
@xmath algebra) ( 3.26 ). The excitations over the antiferromagnetic
vacuum in such a spin chain in the thermodynamic limit describe a
certain relativistic field theory. To see this we should perform a
particle-hole transformation which is very simple in the language of
functional equations. In this way we also see that an overall scalar
factor of the scattering matrix is defined basically by the inverse
deformed Cartan matrix of the @xmath algebra. The ”exponentiation” of
the functional equations through TBA leads to a @xmath -system which
remarkably coincides with the fusion relations for the transfer matrices
of the spin chain. This leads to a conjecture that transfer matrices of
a spin chain discretization coincide with the @xmath -functions which
appear in the TBA approach that describes the field theory.

Another example is the functional equations for the @xmath integrable
spin chains. We showed that whatever is the choice of the Kac-Dynkin
diagram, the functional equations are always organized into a fat hook
structure (more generally, @xmath -hook structure). Then, through the
TBA we get a @xmath -system defined on such fat hook (or @xmath -hook).
One should then ask what is the meaning of the obtained @xmath
-functions. Provided by proper boundary condition, the @xmath -system on
the fat hook is solved by the Bethe Ansatz equations through the chain
of Backlund transforms [ 40 ] ; the @xmath -functions have the meaning
of the transfer matrices of the corresponding spin chain [ 40 ] .
However the boundary conditions that allow Bethe Ansatz solution are not
the ones that are obtained through TBA, therefore relation between
@xmath -functions of TBA and transfer matrices is not clear.

In the @xmath -hook case the solution in terms of the Bethe equations is
still an open problem, though some progress was made in [ 108 ] . The
@xmath -hook case is more involved also because we do not know how to
identify the representations of the @xmath algebra with the points of
@xmath -hook.

The AdS/CFT integrable system which is much more complicated from the
first glance, in fact can be treated very similarly to the theories with
the rational @xmath -matrix. To show this in a more explicit way we may
use the kernels @xmath and @xmath defined respectively by ( 6.71 ) and (
6.61 ). These kernels are specially designed to treat the presence of
the square root cut. Using @xmath , we can rewrite the Bethe equations
in a more tractable form (see section 6.4 ). For example

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.46)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

We see the appearance of the rational structure in such notation.

As we showed in [ V3 ] , the solution of the crossing equations can be
also naturally formulated in terms of the kernel @xmath and the shift
operator @xmath . Using this representation for the dressing phase, we
can write down the functional representation of the BES and the BES/FRS
equations (as well as the other integral equations which follow from the
Beisert-Staudacher asymptotic Bethe Ansatz). It is particularly simple
to derive these functional equations directly from the Bethe Ansatz.

In the third part of the thesis we presented a way to perturbatively
solve the functional equations at strong coupling. The usefulness of the
functional representation is based first of all on the defining property
of the kernel @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (9.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

which allows performing various analytical transformations of the
functional equations. Such transformations of the BES equation at strong
coupling allow to reduce a problem to a simple functional equation (
8.19 ) which does not contain the kernel @xmath . The solution of ( 8.19
) was found by considering of the related Riemann-Hilbert problems in
two different scaling regimes and then identification of unknown
constants by comparing these two regimes.

We applied the same strategy for the solution of the BES/FRS equation
and for performing weak coupling asymptotic expansion of the energy of
the @xmath sigma model. When solving the latter problem we learned that
our approach can be reformulated in terms of the Wiener-Hopf solution of
the integral equations.

To a great extent, the AdS/CFT integrable system was sufficiently well
studied from the point of view of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. The
asymptotic Bethe Ansatz allows computation of the energy in the infinite
volume. Recent developments based on TBA allowed for study of finite
size operators [ 41 , 42 , 43 ] , [ 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 ] , [ 158 , 157 ]
, [ 161 , 236 ] . The anomalous dimension of the Konishi operator, the
simplest nontrivial finite-size operator, was found analytically at weak
coupling up to five loops [ 159 , 237 ] . This anomalous dimension was
also computed numerically up to a sufficiently large values of the
coupling constant [ 238 ] which allowed predicting first two orders of
the strong coupling expansion. Still, the analytic derivation at strong
coupling expansion is missing.

There is one intriguing question that can be asked on the level of the
asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. The integrable system as we know it now may be
an effective one and there it may be a different, probably much simpler
formulation. The one reason for this idea is that the integrable system
was built around a fast spinning string solution and we would rather
like to describe all possible states. This idea appeared soon after the
discovery of the all-loop integrability. In particular, in [ 155 ] it
was suggested that the @xmath sector can be described in terms of the
Hubbard model. This description turned out to be incorrect starting only
from four loops.

One probable answer to the question what is a simpler formulation is
just a @xmath -system constructed through TBA. Then we still should give
an interpretation for the @xmath -functions. We therefore come back to
the question if there a spin chain behind @xmath -hook. If such spin
chain exists, we can think about it as a discretization of the string
sigma model.

Another possibility is that the Zhukovsky cut appears effectively from
the condensation of particles from a hidden level. This idea was
formulated in [ 239 , 240 ] . In [ 241 ] it was shown on the classical
level of the sigma model that the central equation of the
Beisert-Staudacher Bethe Ansatz can be indeed reproduced by this
approach. The consideration of [ 241 ] was not however generalized to
the quantum level, also it is not evident how to include fermionic
interactions in this approach. We hope that the intuition developed in
our work can help to improve the study in this direction.

Let us finally recall recent promising formulation of the string sigma
model as a Pohlmeyer reduced theory [ 242 , 243 , 244 ] . This
formulation is relativistically invariant and describes excitations
around true vacuum. Therefore finding of the quantum integrable model
behind this theory would potentially give a desired simpler description
of the AdS/CFT system.

We see that despite a huge progress in recent years there are still many
questions to answer and that the study of integrability has many
directions to develop in the future.

### Note added

It is important to mention two papers that appeared after the defense of
this thesis.

In [ 245 ] the calculation of the generalized scaling function at
two-loops from the string theory was done. The result coincides with the
one of [ 48 , 37 ] . Before [ 245 ] string theory calculation [ 187 ]
was in disagreement with [ 48 , 37 ] as we discussed in this thesis.

In [ 246 ] certain infinite dimensional representations of @xmath were
identified with the nodes of the @xmath -hook plotted in Fig. 4.11 .
Hence, the @xmath -functions living on the @xmath -hook can be
interpreted as transfer matrices in these representations.

### Appendix A Conventions for action of the shift operator.

Throughout this text we often use the shift operator @xmath which is
defined in the following way:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

A usage of this operator can potentially lead to a number of
ambiguities. The goal of this appendix is to define the conventions
which will give a precise meaning to all the expressions that contain
the shift operator.

###### Analytical continuation.

When the function @xmath is multivalued, we should define in ( A.1 ) the
path that connects points @xmath and @xmath . The default definition is
the following. For @xmath a default set of branch cuts should be given.
Then the points @xmath and @xmath are to be connected by the path that
do not intersect the cuts.

Sometimes we need also an analytical continuation over the straight line
irrespectively if it crosses any cut or not. To denote this case we use
notations

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Correspondingly, if we want use the operator @xmath to make a shift by
@xmath and the shift must be made by analytical continuation over the
straight line, we use notations

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

The difference between ( A.1 ) and ( A.2 ) is shown in Fig. A.1

###### Function in the power of the operator.

For a given operator @xmath , by definition

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

For example

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

In most cases a choice of the branch of the logarithm is not important
since the logarithm is exponentiated. However, if an ambiguity may
appear we take a standard definition of the branch cut of the logarithm
and consider ( A.4 ) in the region of the variable @xmath where no
crossing of the logarithm cut occurs.

###### Rational function of the shift operator

Whenever the shift operator appears in the denominator, simultaneously
only positive or only negative powers of @xmath are allowed. Then the
denominator is understood as a power series assuming that @xmath or
@xmath is sufficiently small. For example:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

The definition makes sense if the action of ( A.6 ) on a function gives
a convergent series.

Note that according to this definition for example

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

Indeed,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

There is however one situation when we can use simultaneously @xmath and
@xmath in the denominator. That is when due to cancelations the actual
expression is a polynomial. An example is a definition of a ”D-number”

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is used for operations with string configurations (of Bethe roots)
of the length @xmath .

There is also one case when we formally deal with nonconvergent series.
Namely, we define

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The reason for such definition is that the second derivative of the
logarithm of the formal equality ( A.10 ) gives a true equality.

For expressions of type

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a rational function we use the following definition.
First, we represent @xmath as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

All the expressions used in the text allow such representation. The
expression @xmath should be understood as @xmath .

Then we define ( A.11 ) by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

From the definition ( A.13 ) of ( A.11 ) it follows that in general

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

However, since in all the cases presented in this text @xmath is a
convergent series, l.h.s. and r.h.s. of ( A.14 ) may differ only by a
constant:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Throughout the text we track out this constant which is typically @xmath
. However, the essential information about algebraic structure of the
expression is contained in the argument @xmath of the exponent and
reader may not follow the preexponent constants.

### Appendix B Structure of the integral equations for the @xmath Bethe
ansatz.

Here we will derive the formula ( 4.27 ) and give an explicit form for
@xmath in ( 4.28 ).

Let us first consider the bosonic node. One can keep in mind the node 4
in Fig. 4.9 . However all the arguments are applicable for any node. The
Bethe equations are written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

If there are roots @xmath that are part of some stack configuration,
then the terms in ( B.1 ) which contain them will cancel against terms
with @xmath and/or @xmath belonging to the same stack. Therefore what is
left are the roots @xmath which form string configurations themselves.
These roots interact in a standard way with @xmath and @xmath and
therefore ( 4.27 ) is correct for bosonic node. This is because ( 4.27 )
is the same equation that appeared in @xmath case. It also happens that
part of @xmath roots belong to the end of the stack (type B in Fig. 4.8
if @xmath is bosonic or type C if @xmath is fermionic). Such roots
should be separated from other @xmath Bethe roots. The corresponding
node for such roots is joined to @xmath by the colorless (black) line
(in terms of Fig. 4.9 . For @xmath this node is below the node 4).

The fermionic Bethe roots generically form stacks of type B or C. Let us
derive the integral equations for the resolvents corresponding to these
stacks. The most general situation for the fermionic node is shown in
Fig. B.1 . We will also adopt numeration from this figure.

We introduce the following notations for the resolvents:

-   @xmath - resolvent for s-stack generated by the 0 node. If @xmath
    this is the type B stack. If @xmath - type C.

-   @xmath , @xmath - the resolvent of @xmath -string for the node
    @xmath .

-   @xmath , @xmath - the resolvents shown on the picture. Their meaning
    is slightly different depending on whether node @xmath is bosonic or
    fermionic.

    If the node @xmath is fermionic (case I) then @xmath is the
    resolvent for type C @xmath -stacks formed by the nodes @xmath and
    @xmath . @xmath is the resolvent for type C stacks terminated by the
    @xmath -string at the node @xmath .

    If the node @xmath is bosonic (case II) then @xmath is the resolvent
    for type C stacks terminated by the @xmath -string at the node
    @xmath , @xmath is the resolvent for type B stack terminated at the
    node @xmath , and @xmath is the resolvent for @xmath -strings of the
    node @xmath .

    The resolvents @xmath and @xmath and the corresponding Bethe roots
    enter the equations considered below in the same way independently
    of whether we deal with case I or II.

-   @xmath - the resolvent for @xmath -stacks originated by the node
    @xmath .

-   @xmath - the resolvent for @xmath -string if the node @xmath is
    bosonic, otherwise it is the resolvent for @xmath -stack originated
    at the node @xmath .

One have to prove the equations ( 4.27 ) for the @xmath -stacks
originated at the node 0. First we consider the case @xmath when the
considered stacks are of B-type. Using the notations of Sec. 1.3 one can
write Bethe equations for the center of this stack as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

The corresponding integral equations are

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

For @xmath one can apply @xmath operator on this equation. It is
straightforward to check that we reproduce ( 4.27 ) if @xmath satisfies

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

This is indeed the case since the bosonic nodes satisfy ( 4.27 ).

The marginal case @xmath gives the correct equations if we apply @xmath
and ( B.4 ) and define @xmath .

Now we consider the case @xmath (type C stacks). In this case the Bethe
equation for the center of the @xmath -stacks are written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

The corresponding integral equation is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.6)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

This equation is also valid for @xmath and coincides with ( B.3 ) for
the same value of @xmath . Therefore one can safely apply @xmath on (
B.6 ) for @xmath . This application leads again to ( 4.27 ).

The case @xmath should be treated separately. In this case for the
application of @xmath one need both equations ( B.3 ) and ( B.6 ). The
obtained integral equation will coincide with ( 4.27 ) if the following
equation holds:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

This equation is nothing than the integral equation for the simple Bethe
roots of @xmath node.

We are left with the special case when @xmath . In this case the same
considerations show that we again obtain ( 4.27 ) if the following
equation is correct

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

This is indeed the case.

Therefore we considered all possible cases and proved ( 4.27 ).

It is left to derive the integral equation for the corner point @xmath .
If the terminating node of the Kac-Dynkin diagram is fermionic than this
node will be exactly in the corner. One can think of it as the @xmath
node in Fig. B.1 (the @xmath node is absent in this case). Then it is
easy to see that the integral equations will be

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

or in the notations @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The role of @xmath and @xmath can be interchanged depending on the
situation.

If the terminating node of the Kac-Dynkin diagram is a bosonic one, then
in the terms of Fig. B.1 there is no @xmath and @xmath node. The corner
resolvent will be @xmath . The integral equation for it is written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

We did not found a particularly nice equation that follows from the
given one.

### Appendix C Solution of the crossing equations in the mirror theory.

The goal of this appendix is to show how the solution [ V3 ] of the
crossing equations can be modified to be applicable in the mirror
theory. The mirror theory is the initial point for the construction of
the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz. It was formulated in [ 41 , 42 ] as the
analytical continuation of the physical theory. The dressing phase was
also found there as the analytical continuation. We would use a
different way and define the mirror theory from the bootstrap approach.
This would give us mirror crossing equations solution of which leads to
the mirror dressing phase.

While in the physical theory the physical region is defined by the
condition @xmath , in the mirror theory the physical region is defined
by the condition @xmath [ 42 ] . Therefore let us define a mirror
Jukowsky variable @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

for which condition @xmath is satisfied ¹ ¹ 1 Mirror Zhukovsky variables
where also used in [ 47 ] . Mirror and physical Zhukovsky variables are
related by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The mirror theory is conjectured to be integrable. It has the same
symmetry algebra as the physical theory. Therefore we can apply the
bootstrap approach similarly as it was done for the physical theory. We
would get then the Bethe Ansatz equations with the central node equation
given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where dots stay for the interaction with the Bethe roots from nested
levels. This interaction as well as the nested Bethe equations are
exactly the same as in ( 6.41 ) except for the replacement @xmath .

The dressing phase @xmath does not coincide with the dressing phase of
the physical theory. We will now formulate the mirror crossing equations
which this dressing phase should satisfy. The crossing equations can be
derived by simple modification for the case of the mirror theory of the
approach of Janik [ 16 ] . These equations now read

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the @xmath stands for the analytical continuation over the contour
@xmath shown in Fig. C.1 . Note that @xmath is not the same contour as
was used for the crossing transformation in the physical theory. In
fact, @xmath .

Solution of ( C.4 ) undergoes the same steps as in the case of the
physical theory. The only difference is that instead of the cut @xmath (
@xmath ) we use the cut @xmath ( @xmath ). Therefore the solution of the
mirror crossing equations is given by the following expression:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is defined as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Let us find the relation between physical dressing factor @xmath and the
mirror dressing factor @xmath . For this we first need establish the
relation between @xmath and @xmath . When @xmath has singularities only
in the lower half plane then

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.7)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

If @xmath has singularities only in the upper half plane then

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.8)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

If @xmath has singularities in the lower and the upper half planes then
we have to represent @xmath as a sum of two functions and then apply ( C
) and ( C.8 ).

By application of transformations ( C ) and ( C.8 ) to the mirror
dressing factor ( C.5 ) we obtain in the region @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (C.9)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Therefore equation ( C.3 ) can be also written in the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

where ”an.cont.” means that expression in brackets is obtained by
analytical continuation from the region @xmath to the real values of
@xmath and @xmath . Except for this analytical continuation, the r.h.s.
of ( C.10 ) coincides with the r.h.s. of the Bethe Ansatz equation (
6.47 ) for the @xmath sector of the physical theory.

We are now at the point to compare our considerations with the results
obtained in the literature. The mirror theory was initially formulated
as analytical continuation of the physical theory, the mirror dressing
phase was defined not in the way that we define it here, but by the
analytical continuation of @xmath .

It was shown that the bound states of magnons in the mirror theory
appear for the excitations on the AdS [ 42 ] (in the physical theory
analogical bound states appeared for excitations on @xmath ), therefore
the @xmath sector was considered for the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. The
Bethe equations for this sector were given in the form ( C.10 ) [ 42 ] .
Then after studying of the mirror dressing phase and the dressing phase
for bound states obtained from fusion it was realized that the product
of the mirror dressing phase and the BDS factor @xmath has much simple
analytical properties [ 47 , 213 , 247 ] . The product of the mirror
dressing phase and the BDS factor was called in [ 213 ] the improved
dressing phase. A representation analogical to ( C.5 ) was first time
derived in [ 47 ] .

In our approach we define the mirror theory purely by the bootstrap
method and therefore without any reference to the physical theory. We
see that what is called in [ 213 ] the improved dressing phase is in
fact a true dressing phase of the mirror theory which follows from the
solution of the crossing equations ( C.4 ).

Let us finally comment on the dressing factor for the magnon bound
states. The magnon bound states from the point of view of the Bethe
Ansatz are string-type configurations [ 248 ] , exactly as in the case
of XXX spin chain. Using the notations of section 1.3 we can write down
the dressing factor for the interaction of @xmath -string and @xmath
-string as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then, using representation ( C.5 ) we can immediately see that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

In fact, the same derivation can be made in the physical theory. We have
just to replace @xmath with @xmath .

A word of caution should made here. Derivation of ( C.12 ) based on the
string configurations is not valid in the strip where Zhukovsky cut is
defined. This is a strip @xmath for the physical theory and @xmath for
the mirror theory. However, once the dressing factor ( C.12 ) is
established in the permitted region it can be smoothly continued to the
forbidden strips.

### Appendix D @xmath Heisenberg magnet. Technical details

The most general solution of ( 7.27 ) in the @xmath order is the
following

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (D.1)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

To fix the coefficients @xmath and @xmath we should consider the
following solution in the double scaling limit

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (D.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Comparison of large @xmath expansion of @xmath and one that follows from
( D.2 ) fixes the coefficients @xmath and @xmath to be

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (D.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

### Appendix E Mathematica code for asymptotic expansions

#### e.1 Derivatives of the gamma functions

For the calculation of the asymptotic expansion of the cusp anomalous
dimension and the energy density of the @xmath sigma model we need to
know the value of the following ratio:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (E.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

In principle we can evaluate this ratio using the code

            D[Gamma[x], {x, n}]/Gamma[x] // FunctionExpand // Expand           

However, this evaluation at large values of @xmath turns out to be the
most time consuming place in the whole recursive procedure. Therefore we
will present here a quicker code.

The code is based on the equality

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (E.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

and its consequence for @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (E.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

Using the fact that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (E.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the dots stay for the polynomial in @xmath with @xmath , we obtain
the recursive procedure to calculate ( E.1 ). The code for this
recursive procedure is the following:

    DG[a_,1] := DG[a,1] = D[Log[Gamma[a+x]],x]/. x->0//FunctionExpand;
    DG[a_,n_/;n>1] := DG[a, n]=
    (-1)^n Gamma[n]FunctionExpand@Zeta[n,a]-(D[Log[f[x]],{x,n}]/.f[x]->1
    /.Derivative[n][f][x]->0/.Derivative[m_][f][x]:>DG[m])//Expand;

Below we will use a slightly modified version of this code.

#### e.2 Cusp anomalous dimension

We reexpand the solution ( 8.23 ) in the double scaling limit ( 8.25 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (E.5)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

The inverse Laplace transform of this series is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.6)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.7)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

From the other side, the solution in the double scaling limit @xmath is
given by ( 8.28 ):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (E.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

Comparing ( E.6 ) and ( E.8 ) we see that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (E.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

The coefficients @xmath are expanded in the power series of @xmath ¹ ¹ 1
The recursion procedure that we build allows to express all the
coefficients as @xmath times a polynomial in @xmath ; @xmath due to (
E.15 ). :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using this expansion we can find the coefficient for the @xmath term in
( E.9 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the coefficient in the expansion

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since the l.h.s. of ( E.11 ) contains only nonpositive powers of @xmath
, we conclude that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

This gives us the recursion relation:

  -- -- -- --------
           (E.14)
  -- -- -- --------

This relation expresses ² ² 2 @xmath and @xmath are related by ( E.7 ).
@xmath in terms of @xmath with @xmath and @xmath with @xmath . Since
@xmath for @xmath , the recursion finally allows to express @xmath in
terms of @xmath . The latter cannot be found from the condition ( E.13
). It is fixed by the normalization condition ( 8.1 ) which implies that
the coefficients @xmath satisfy the constraint

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

The consequence of this constraint is that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

This completes the recursive procedure and it can be implemented in
Mathemtica . The code is the following:                G              
               = Gamma; ClearAll[a, F1, F2, F3, F4];              
               a[0, 0] = 1; a[0, k_ /; k < 0] = 0;              
               a[0, k_] := a[0, k] = - Sum[a[n, k - n] + a[-n, k - n], {n, 1, k}];

               F2[n_, p_, s_] :=  F2[n, p, s] =              
               FunctionExpand[              
               G                              [n + s/4]/

               F3[n_, p_, k_, s_] :=  F3[n, p, k, s] =

               G

               F4[n_, p_, k_, s_] :=  F4[n, p, k, s] =

               [2 p + 1 - 2 n - k];              

    a[n_ /; n != 0, m_] :=  a[n, m] =  Block[{s = Sign[n], nn = Abs[n]},
      - Expand@Plus@@Expand/@{
      Sum[invT[s, nn + k] F1[nn, k, s] a[0, m - k], {k, 0, m}],
      Sum[invT[s, p] F2[nn, p, s] a[s (nn - p), m], {p, 1, nn - 1}],
      Sum[invT[s, p] F3[nn, p, k, s] a[s (nn+k-p),m-k],{k,1,m},{p,0,k+nn-1}],
      Sum[invT[s, p] F4[nn, p, k, s] a[-s(nn+k-p),m-k],{k,1,m},{p,0,k+nn-1}]}];

The function            invT[s, p]           encodes @xmath . A direct
way to evaluate it is
              invT[s_, p_] :=  invT[s, p] =  Expand@FunctionExpand@SeriesCoefficient[             
              If[s == 1,                            G             
              [3/4 - x/(2                            \[Pi]             
              )]/(                            G             
              [3/4]                            G             
              [1-x/(2                            \[Pi]             
              )]),                           
              G                            [1/4 - x/(2             
              \[Pi]                            )]/(             
              G                            [1/4]             
              G                            [1-x/(2             
              \[Pi]             
              )])], {x, 0, p}];             

Now we can find the coefficients @xmath for the expansion of the scaling
function:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

              ClearAll[f]; f[0] = 4; f[k_] := f[k] =             
              Expand@Sum[4 m ( a[m, k - m] - a[-m, k - m]), {m, 1, k}]             

###### Structure of the result and improvement of the code

The proposed above code for              invT[s,p]             allows
find the first 10 coefficients @xmath in about 20 seconds. The result
obtained in this way is however not well structured, its further
simplification is time consuming. Here we will give another code for
             invT[s,p]             that leads from the beginning to a
nice representation of the result.

We evaluate the derivatives of the gamma functions as was explained in
section E.1 . This evaluation is the recursive procedure with @xmath as
the input. In our case @xmath . For these particular values of @xmath we
have the following explicit expressions:

for @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.18)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

for @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.19)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are defined by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

The ratios @xmath for even values of @xmath and @xmath for odd vales of
@xmath are rational numbers.

Let us look more carefully on the structure of the recursive procedure
which takes ( E.18 ) and ( E.2 ) as the input and gives @xmath as the
output. Each coefficient @xmath has an overall multiplier @xmath due to
the expansion over the combination @xmath . Except for this
multiplication all the operations which are involved in the recursive
procedure reduce to the polynomial combinations, with rational
coefficients, of ( E.18 ) and ( E.2 ).

###### Cancelation of logarithms and @xmath.

As was initially observed in [ 32 ] , the coefficients of the expansion
of the scaling function do not contain @xmath if to expand over the
shifted constant @xmath . The coefficients of the expansion also do not
contain @xmath . We checked these observations up to the tenth order and
will assume that they are true for arbitrary order. Using this
assumption and the rational structure of the recursive procedure, we can
put @xmath and @xmath in ( E.18 ).

###### The property of maximal transcendentality.

Let us assign the transcendentality @xmath to @xmath of odd argument and
to @xmath of even argument. We assign transcendentality 0 to @xmath and
to rational numbers. As we checked up to the tenth order and assume to
be true for any order, the coefficient @xmath of the expansion ( E.17 )
has the transcendentality @xmath which is the maximal possible
transcendentality at this order. This was initially observed also in [
32 ] . Due to this property we can leave only the terms with maximal
transcendentality in ( E.18 ) and ( E.2 ). We put @xmath in ( E.18 ) and
@xmath in ( E.2 ).

After these simplifications we can put @xmath in the combination @xmath
. Indeed, since @xmath is now the only place where @xmath appears,
@xmath becomes an overall multiplier and can be restored at the end of
the calculation ( @xmath should contain @xmath as an overall
multiplier).

Using these simplifications, we propose the following code for @xmath :

                            G             
              = Gamma;ClearAll[DG, DGp, D1G, invT];             

              DG[1] = 0; DGp[1] = 0; DG[0] = 1; DGp[0] = 1; D1G[0] = 1;             

              DG[n_ /; n > 1] := DG[n] = Expand[             

              (-1)^n                            G             
              [n] If[EvenQ[n],  0,             
              \[Zeta]             
              [n]] - (D[Log[h[x]], {x, n}]             

              /.h[x] -> 1/. Derivative[n][h][x] -> 0/. Derivative[m_][h][x] :> DG[m])];             

              DGp[n_ /; n > 1] := DGp[n] =  Expand[(-1)^n 4^n/2             
              G                            [n]             

              If[EvenQ[n], -             
              \[Beta]             
              [n], (1 - 2^-n)             
              \[Zeta]             
              [n]] - (D[Log[h[x]], {x, n}]             

              /. h[x] -> 1/. Derivative[n][h][x] -> 0/. Derivative[m_][h][x] :> DGp[m])];             
               D1G[n_ /; n > 0] := D1G[n] = Expand[D[1/h[x], {x, n}]              

              /. h[x] -> 1/. Derivative[m_][h][x] :> DG[m]];             

              invT[_, 0] = 1; invT[_, 1] = 0;             

              invT[1, p_ /; p >= 2] := invT[1, p] =             

              Expand@Sum[(-1/2)^p 1/(             
              G                            [r + 1]             
              G             
              [p - r + 1]) DGp[r] D1G[p - r],{r, 0, p}];             

              invT[-1, p_ /; p >= 2] := invT[-1, p] =             

              Expand@(invT[1, p] /.             
              \[Beta]                            [x_] -> (-             
              \[Beta]                            [x]));             

Now we can evaluate @xmath , using the improved definition of
              invT[s,p]              . For example, the first five
orders are given by
                 In=   Table[f[n]/\[Pi]^n, {n, 0, 4}]//Expand                

              Out=  {4, 0, -(              @xmath
              [2]/\[Pi]^2), -((27              @xmath
              [3])/32/\[Pi]^3),             

              -(2              @xmath
              [2]^2 + (21              @xmath
              [4])/4)/\[Pi]^4}             

The result coincides with the one given in [ 32 ] . This code allows to
calculate first 10 orders in few seconds and first 30 orders in half of
an hour.

#### e.3 Energy density of the @xmath sigma model

In chapter 9 we gave a general form of the perturbative expansion of the
resolvent in the large @xmath limit ( 9.25 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

We replace in ( E.21 ) @xmath with the double scaling variable @xmath ,
perform large @xmath expansion, and make the inverse Laplace transform (
9.28 ). To do these steps it is useful to represent @xmath as @xmath .
The result is:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (E.22)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

This expression should be equal to the solution in the double scaling
limit ( 9.3 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.23)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

To obtain the expression of type ( E.3 ) we should perform a small
@xmath expansion of ( E.3 ). Before doing this let us rewrite the
argument of the exponent in @xmath in the following way:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

The asymptotic expansion of the energy density @xmath can be expressed
as @xmath times a power series in @xmath and @xmath . Due to the
expected renorm-group properties of the solution it is possible to
introduce a such coupling constant @xmath that this series will be
expressed as the power series of the coupling constant. Assuming this
property, which we checked up to 10 first orders, we replace @xmath with
zero. Below we give a more accurate explanation of this step.

Note that to derive the correct expansion of @xmath and @xmath in the
powers of @xmath and @xmath , given by ( 9.34 ) ³ ³ 3 We leave the
derivation of ( 9.34 ), which requires keeping the term @xmath , as an
exercise for a curious reader (see also formula (22) in [ V2 ] ). The
logic of the derivation remains the same, even if @xmath is present. ,
we cannot do the replacement @xmath . It is only admissible when our
goal is to express @xmath in terms of the coupling constant.

Within @xmath , expansion of ( E.3 ) at small @xmath leads to:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.25)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The requirement

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

unambiguously fixes the coefficients @xmath and @xmath in a recursive
way. To express @xmath in terms of @xmath and @xmath known from the
earlier steps of recursion we need to consider ( E.26 ) with @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath . To do the same for @xmath we need to consider ( E.26 )
with @xmath , @xmath , @xmath . The recursion procedure allows to
express @xmath and @xmath in terms of @xmath which is explicitly known.

Among all the equations ( E.26 ) with @xmath we use only those for which
@xmath . All the other equations with @xmath can serve for the
verification of the self-consistency of our solution.

The evaluation of the derivatives of the gamma-functions is made using
the trick of Sec. E.1 . As in the case of the cusp anomalous dimension,
a special structure of the answer allows to simplify this calculation.
As we observed up to tenth order, the coefficients of asymptotic
expansion are given in terms of zeta-functions of odd argument and
rational numbers only. Assuming that this property holds at any order,
we perform the following replacements in @xmath : @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath .

The Mathematica code for the recursive procedure is the following:

    (* Derivatives of the gamma functions *)
    ClearAll[DG, G, subs]; G = Gamma;
    subs = {_Log -> 0, EulerGamma -> 0, \[Pi] -> 0, Zeta -> \[Zeta]};
    DG[_, 0] = 1;
    DG[a_List, n_?IntegerQ /; n > 0] := DG[a, n] =
      Block[{f, y}, (Plus @@ FunctionExpand@ Flatten[
      {1, -1} D[Log@G@a, {x, n}] /. x -> 0] /. subs) -
      (D[Log[f[y]], {y, n}] /. f[y] -> 1 /. Derivative[n][f][y] -> 0
      /. Derivative[m_][f][y] :> DG[a, m]) // Expand]

    (* Definition of structure constants *)
    ClearAll[F, \[CapitalPhi], Vc, VQ, Q, c];
    F[n_, t_, k_, r_] := F[n, t, k, r] = ((-1)^k 2^(1-2 r))/G[r+1]Binomial[
      k, t](FunctionExpand[(G[1/2] G[-n+1/2-r])/G[n+1/2]/{
      G[-n+1/2-2r],G[-n+3/2-2r]}].{DG[{{-n+1/2-r},{-n+1/2-2r,n+1/2}}+x,k-t],
      2 r Mod[k, 2]DG[{{-n+1/2-r},{-n+3/2-2r,n+1/2}}+x,k-t]}) //  Expand;
    \[CapitalPhi][a_, b_] := \[CapitalPhi][a, b] =
      (1 - 2 \[CapitalDelta])^b/(G[b + 1] G[a - b + 1])DG[
      {{1 + 2 x \[CapitalDelta]}, {1/2 + x}}, a - b] // Expand;
    VQ[n_, 0, t_] := VQ[n, 0, t] =
      (2 (1 - 2 \[CapitalDelta])^t)/(G[t + 1] G[n - t + 1]) DG[
      {{1 + 2 x \[CapitalDelta]}, {3/2 + x}}, n - t] // Expand;

    (* Recursive procedure *)
    Vc[n_, m_, t_] := Plus @@ Flatten[Table[
      pc[n + r, m - r, k] F[n, t, k, r], {k, t, n + m}, {r, Max[0, -n], m}]
      /. If[n >= 0, pc[n, m, t] -> Pc, 0 -> 0] /.  pc -> c] // Expand;
    VQ[n_, m_, t_] := Plus @@ (
      Table[\[CapitalPhi][n+c+1,t]pQ[c,m-c-1],{c, Max[0, t - n - 1], m - 1}]

    Q[a_, b_] := Q[a, b] =  PQ /. Solve[
       VQ[-a - 1, b + a + 1, 0] == Vc[-a - 1, b + a + 1, 0],PQ][[1]]//Expand

The energy density and the particle density represented in the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

can be evaluated using

    (* Energy and particle density *)
    ClearAll[ne, nr];
    ne[0] = nr[0] = 1;
    ne[n_] := ne[n] = Expand@Sum[2^(s + 1) Q[s, n - s - 1], {s, 0, n - 1}];
    nr[n_] := nr[n] = Expand[c[0, n, 0] - 2 c[0, n, 1]];

###### Expression in terms of the coupling constant.

We would like now to express the dimensionless ratio

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

in terms of the coupling constant defined in ( 9.11 ). At this step we
would like to better explain the substitution @xmath , therefore at the
moment we consider that the term @xmath is present. In terms of the
parameter @xmath , the coupling constant is defined as:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

Solving this equation perturbatively at large @xmath , we express @xmath
as a series in @xmath and @xmath . Expression ( E.28 ) is also given by
such series. We can treat @xmath as the independent (from @xmath )
parameter and reexpress ( E.28 ) in terms of @xmath . The expected
renorm-group dynamics predicts that all the @xmath terms cancel out.
Therefore we can put @xmath equal to any quantity. For simplicity
reasons we choose @xmath . Performing this replacement in ( E.29 )
includes one step which should be done carefully:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

Taking this into account, we get the following equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is valid modulo the terms proportional to @xmath ⁴ ⁴ 4 or to
@xmath that also cancel out from the final expression .

Substituting

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (E.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

to ( E.31 ), we find recursively the coefficients @xmath which allows us
to express ( E.29 ) in terms of @xmath and to find the coefficients
@xmath defined in ( 9.7 ). The Mathematica code for this procedure is
the following.

    M = 10;(* Maximal desired order *)
    a = \[Alpha]; ClearAll[b, Binv, Bdir, Bdird, Bdirreg];
    b[1] = 1; b[2] = -\[CapitalDelta];
    Binv[0] = 1; Bdirreg[0] = 1; Bdird[0] = 1;
    Binv[1] = Sum[b[n] a^n, {n, 1, M}] + O[a]^(M + 1);
    Bdir = Expand /@ (1/Binv[1]);
    Bdirreg[1] = 1/a + \[CapitalDelta] - Bdir;
    Bdird[1] = a Bdir - 1 + O[a]^(M - 1);
    Binv[n_] := Binv[n] = (Binv[n - 1] + O[a]^M) (Binv[1] + O[a]^M)
    Bdirreg[n_] := Bdirreg[n] =  Expand /@ (
      (Bdirreg[n - 1] + O[a]^(M - 2)) (Bdirreg[1] + O[a]^(M - 2)))
    Bdird[n_] :=  Bdird[n] =  Expand /@ (
      Bdird[n - 1] + O[a]^(M - 2)) (Bdird[1] + O[a]^(M - 2));

    left = Expand /@ Sum[nr[k] Binv[k], {k, 0, M - 2}] + O[a]^(M - 1);
    right = Expand /@ (Sum[FunctionExpand[Gamma[\[CapitalDelta]]/(
         Gamma[k + 1] Gamma[\[CapitalDelta] - k])] Bdird[k], {k, 0, M - 2}]
         Sum[Bdirreg[n]/Gamma[n + 1], {n, 0, M - 2}]);

    Do[b[n] =  b[n] /. Expand@ Solve[left[[3, n - 1]] == right[[3, n - 1]],
      b[n]][[1]], {n, 3, M}]

    nra = Expand /@ Sum[nr[k] Expand /@ Binv[k], {k, 0, M}];
    nea = Expand /@ Sum[ne[k] Expand /@ Binv[k], {k, 0, M}];
    answer = Expand /@ (Binv[1] nea/nra^2);

The first few coefficients @xmath are given by:

    chi[n_] := answer[[3, n]] // Expand
    Table[chi[n],{n,3,6}]

With this code @xmath can be found in less then one minute using a
single core at 2Ghz. To get the expression for @xmath approximately 20
hours is needed.
