We explore two-dimensional sigma models with @xmath supersymmetry
through their chiral algebras. Perturbatively, the chiral algebras of
@xmath models have a rich infinite-dimensional structure described by
the cohomology of a sheaf of chiral differential operators.
Nonperturbatively, instantons can deform this structure drastically. We
show that under some conditions they even annihilate the whole algebra,
thereby triggering the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry. For a
certain class of Kähler manifolds, this suggests that there are no
harmonic spinors on their loop spaces and gives a physical proof of the
Höhn–Stolz conjecture.
