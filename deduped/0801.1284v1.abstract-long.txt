This work is devoted to the study of Quantum Field Theories (QFT) on
fuzzy spaces .

Fuzzy spaces are approximations to the algebra of functions of a
continuous space by a finite matrix algebra. In the limit of infinitely
large matrices the formulation is exact.

An attractive feature of this approach is that it transparently shows
how the geometrical properties of the continuous space are preserved.

In the study of the non-perturbative regime of QFT, fuzzy spaces provide
a possible alternative to the lattice as a regularisation method. The
thesis is divided into two parts:

1.  We perform Monte Carlo simulations of a @xmath theory on a @xmath
    -dimensional Euclidean space. The regularisation consist of
    replacing space by a fuzzy @xmath -dimensional sphere, namely @xmath
    , and Euclidean time by a conventional lattice. We identify the
    phase diagram of this model. In addition to the usual disordered and
    uniform ordered phases we find a third phase of non-uniform
    ordering. This indicates the existence of the phenomenon called
    UV-IR mixing in the strong coupling regime.

2.  Second we present a geometrical analysis of the scalar field theory
    on a @xmath -dimensional fuzzy sphere, @xmath . An approximation to
    @xmath is of special interest since @xmath is the natural
    replacement of @xmath in studies of Euclidean QFT. Nevertheless a
    fuzzy version of @xmath cannot be achieved by quantisation of the
    classical space.

The problem is circumvented by defining a scalar theory on a larger
space, @xmath which is @xmath -dimensional. It includes degrees of
freedom related to @xmath plus others beyond @xmath . Those extra
degrees of freedom are dynamically suppressed through a probabilistic
method. The analysis of the geometrical structures allows us to
interpret this procedure as a Kaluza-Klein reduction of @xmath to @xmath
.
