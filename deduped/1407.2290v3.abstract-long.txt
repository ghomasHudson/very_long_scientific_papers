In the Masterâ€™s thesis of the author, we investigate certain aspects of
gravitational physics that emerge from stochastic toy models of
holographic gauge theories. We begin by reviewing field theory
thermodynamics, black hole thermodynamics and how the AdS / CFT
correspondence provides a link between the two. We then study a
nonlinear evolution equation for the energy density that was derived
last year from a random walk governed by the density of states. When one
dimension is non-compact, a variety of field theories produce long lived
plasma balls that are dual to black holes. This is due to a trapping
phenomenon associated with the Hagedorn density of states. With the help
of numerical and mathematical results, we show that problems arise when
two or more dimensions are non-compact. A natural extension of our model
involves a system of partial differential equations for both energy and
momentum. Our second model is shown to have some desired, but also some
undesired properties, such as a potential disagreement with
hydrodynamics.
