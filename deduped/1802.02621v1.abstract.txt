We investigate the effect of thermal expansion and gravity on the propagation
and stability of flames in inhomogeneous mixtures. We focus on laminar flames
in the simple configuration of an infinitely long channel with rigid porous
walls in order to understand the effect of inhomogeneities on these fundamental
structures.
