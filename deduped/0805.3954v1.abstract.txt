This thesis is a global, model-independent search for new physics, performed
with CDF Run II data. The Standard Model prediction is implemented in all final
states simultaneously, and an array of statistical probes is employed to search
for significant discrepancies between data and prediction. The probes (also
known as "Vista", "Sleuth" and "Bump Hunter") are sensitive to population
discrepancies, shape disagreements in distributions of kinematic variables,
excesses of events of high total transverse momentum, and local excesses of
data suggesting resonant production of new massive particles. The result of
this search, first in 1 fb-1 and then in 2 fb-1, is null, namely no
considerable evidence of new physics was found.
