In this thesis, we consider a way to construct a rich family of compact
Riemann surfaces in a combinatorial way. Given a 3-regular graph with
orientation, we construct a finite-area hyperbolic Riemann surface by
gluing triangles together according to the combinatorics of the graph.
We then compactify this surface by adding finitely many points.

We discuss this construction by considering a number of examples. In
particular, we see that the surface depends in a strong way on the
orientation.

We then consider the effect the process of compactification has on the
hyperbolic metric of the surface. To that end, we ask when we can change
the metric in the horocycle neighbourhoods of the cusps to get a
hyperbolic metric on the compactification. In general, the process of
compactification can have drastic effects on the hyperbolic structure.
For instance, if we compactify the 3-punctured sphere we lose its
hyperbolic structure.

We show that when the cusps have lengths bigger than @xmath we can fill
in the horocycle neighbourhoods and retain negative curvature.

Furthermore, the condition that the horocycles have length @xmath @xmath
is sharp. We show by examples that there exist curves arbitrarily close
to horocycles of length @xmath , which cannot be so filled in. Such
curves can even be taken to be convex.
