The development of attosecond technology has enabled the real-time
observation of coherent electron motion in atoms, molecules and condensed
phases. Experimentally, it is now possible to generate laser pulses of
durations of only a few tens of attoseconds. These durations are of the order
of the revolution period of the first Bohr orbit (150 asec), opening the way to
visualize and even control electron dynamics at its natural time scale. This
PhD thesis constitutes a theoretical study of fundamental phenomena occurring
in gas-phase molecules upon interaction with light. We have investigated
ultrafast charge migration in biological molecules initiated by attosecond XUV
pulses. In addition, we have studied the high-energy interferences that arise
in the vibrationally-resolved photoelectron spectra of small polyatomic
molecules. In order to explore these complex phenomena, we have employed
numerical methods that describe molecular photoionization by evaluating
continuum scattering wave functions, allowing us to compute different
observables such as time-dependent electron densities or photoionization cross
sections.
