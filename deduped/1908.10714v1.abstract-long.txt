Machine learning has made tremendous progress in recent years and
received large amounts of public attention. Though we are still far from
designing a full artificially intelligent agent, machine learning has
brought us many applications in which computers solve human learning
tasks remarkably well. Much of this progress comes from a recent trend
within machine learning, called deep learning . Deep learning models are
responsible for many state-of-the-art applications of machine learning.

Despite their success, deep learning models are hard to train, very
difficult to understand, and often times so complex that training is
only possible on very large GPU clusters. Lots of work has been done on
enabling neural networks to learn efficiently. However, the design and
architecture of such neural networks is often done manually through
trial and error and expert knowledge. This thesis inspects different
approaches, existing and novel, to automate the design of deep
feedforward neural networks in an attempt to create less complex models
with good performance that take away the burden of deciding on an
architecture and make it more efficient to design and train such deep
networks.
