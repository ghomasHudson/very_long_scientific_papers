In this thesis, we study about three subjects: 
1- Classical simulation of two spin-s singlet correlations for all s involving spin measurements,
2- Quantum correlations in successive single spin measurements,
3- Non locality without inequality for almost all two-qubit entangled states based on Cabello's non locality argument.
