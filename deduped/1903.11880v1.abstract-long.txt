We construct examples in any odd dimension of contact manifolds with
finite and non-zero algebraic torsion (in the sense of [ LW11 ] ), which
are therefore tight and do not admit strong symplectic fillings. We
prove that Giroux torsion implies algebraic @xmath -torsion in any odd
dimension, which proves a conjecture in [ MNW13 ] . These results are
part of the authorâ€™s PhD thesis [ Mo2 ] .
