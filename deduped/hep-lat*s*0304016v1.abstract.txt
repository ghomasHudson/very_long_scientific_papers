This thesis is focused on the implementation and the application of a novel
kind of algorithm which is expected to overcome the limitations of older
schemes. This new algorithm is named Multiboson Method. It allows to simulate
an arbitrary number of dynamical fermion flavors, which can in principle have
different masses. It will be shown that it exhibits better scaling properties
for light fermions than other methods. Therefore, it has the potential to
become the method of choice.
