The thesis deals with recognizing diffeomorphisms from fractal properties of
discrete orbits, generated by iterations of such diffeomorphisms. The notion of
fractal properties of a set refers to the box dimension, the Minkowski content
and their appropriate generalizations, or, in wider sense, to the
epsilon-neighborhoods of sets, for small, positive values of parameter epsilon.
In the first part of the thesis, we consider the relation between the
multiplicity of the fixed point of a real-line diffeomorphism, and the
asymptotic behavior of the length of the epsilon-neighborhoods of its orbits.
We establish the bijective correspondence. At the fixed point, the
diffeomorphisms may be differentiable or nondifferentiable. The results are
applied to the question of cyclicity of some planar limit periodic sets of
polynomial fields, whose first return maps are real-line diffeomorphisms. In
the second part of the thesis, we consider the relation between formal and
analytic classes of complex diffeomorphisms f:C->C and epsilon-neighborhoods of
their orbits. It is shown that the formal class can be read from generalized
fractal properties of any orbit. The results are directly applied to formal
classification of complex saddles in C^2. On the other hand, concerning the
analytic classification, we state problems in reading the analytic class of a
diffeomorphisms from epsilon-neighborhoods of orbits.
