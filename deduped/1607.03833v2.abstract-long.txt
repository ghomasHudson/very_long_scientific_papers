The results summarized here are intended as rigorous mathematical statements on various physical models coming from condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics (classical and quantum), quantum field theory and cold atoms physics. The main tools are mostly those of the mathematical analyst: partial differential equations, functional analysis, spectral theory, calculus of variations, with some incursions into probability theory. A running thread is the construction, by rigorous asymptotic analysis most of the time, of bridges between different levels of mathematical modeling of physical phenomena.
