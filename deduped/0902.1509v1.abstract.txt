This thesis firstly investigates whether D=11 supergravity can be lifted to a
higher dimensional theory without introducing additional bosonic fields by
interpreting the E(7(7))-symmetry of N=8 d=4 supergravity as part of a
coordinate symmetry acting in a 60 dimensional restricted or exceptional
geometry. It is proved that the supersymmetry variations of D=11 supergravity,
truncated to d=7, can be reproduced from this exceptional geometry in the
expected manner. Secondly, Borisov's and Ogievetsky's procedure to construct a
theory with diffeomorphism covariance from the joint non-linear realization of
the affine linear subgroup of diffeomorphisms with the conformal one is
reviewed in detail, which is then extended by discussing torsion in this
context.
