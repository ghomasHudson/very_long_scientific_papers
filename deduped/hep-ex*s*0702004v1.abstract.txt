In this thesis, the first determination of the electric charge of the top
quark is presented using 370pb-1 of data recorded by the D0 detector at the
Fermilab Tevatron accelerator. ttbar events are selected with one isolated
electron or muon and at least four jets out of which two are b-tagged by
reconstruction of a secondary decay vertex (SVT). The method is based on the
discrimination between b- and bbar-quark jets using a jet charge algorithm
applied to SVT-tagged jets. A method to calibrate the jet charge algorithm with
data is developed. A constrained kinematic fit is performed to associate the W
bosons to the correct b-quark jets in the event and extract the top quark
electric charge. The data is in good agreement with the Standard Model top
quark electric charge of 2e/3. The scenario where the selected sample is solely
composed of an exotic quark Q with charge 4e/3 is excluded at 92% confidence
level. Using a Bayesian approach, an upper limit on the fraction of exotic
quarks rho < 0.80 at 90% confidence level is obtained.
