The Higgs boson, relic of the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking, is
one of the most important searches at current hadron colliders. This thesis
wishes to present theoretical predictions for the inclusive production and
decay of the Higgs boson(s) either in the context of the Standard Model (SM) or
in its minimal supersymmetric extension (MSSM) where five Higgs bosons are
present. We will focus on the two major hadron colliders, the Fermilab Tevatron
collider and the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which is running at 7 TeV. We
will present the predictions for the dominant production and decay channels and
describe the thorough analysis of the theoretical uncertainties affecting these
predictions that has been conducted. We will give the implications on
experimental searches and in particular revisit the inferred limits on SM Higgs
boson mass and on the MSSM parameter space. We will also give an important
consequence on the SM Higgs search in the $H \to \tau \tau$ channel. Some
perspectives for futur works will be given in the end.
