The introduction of Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes into the population has
recently been proposed as an alternative strategy against dengue. Although
laboratory experiments have shown that the Wolbachia bacterium can reduce the
levels of dengue virus in mosquitoes, it is also important to assess the
performance of Wolbachia in reducing the incidence of dengue in human
populations.In this thesis, deterministic mathematical models of human and
mosquito populations in which either one or two dengue serotypes circulate are
developed. We adapt these models to enable the investigation of dengue disease
dynamics in the absence and presence of Wolbachia in order to assess the
performance of Wolbachia as a strategy to reduce human dengue incidence. When
studying the situation in which a single dengue serotype is present in the
population, we consider scenarios where dengue is introduced into the human
population once and multiple times.
