In this thesis, we consider semi-algebraic sets over a real closed field
defined by quadratic polynomials. Semi-algebraic sets of @xmath are
defined as the smallest family of sets in @xmath that contains the
algebraic sets as well as the sets defined by polynomial inequalities,
and which is also closed under the boolean operations (complementation,
finite unions and finite intersections). We prove the following new
bounds on the topological complexity of semi-algebraic sets over a real
closed field defined by quadratic polynomials, in terms of the
parameters of the system of polynomials defining them, which improve the
known results.

1.  Let @xmath be defined by @xmath with
    @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath , for @xmath . We prove that @xmath ,
    @xmath .

2.  Let @xmath ,
    with @xmath , @xmath , @xmath . Let @xmath be a semi-algebaic set,
    defined by a Boolean formula without negations, whose atoms are of
    the form, @xmath .
    Let @xmath be the projection on the last @xmath co-ordinates. We
    prove that the number of stable homotopy types amongst the fibers
    @xmath is bounded by @xmath .

We conclude the thesis with presenting two new algorithms along with
their implementations. The first algorithm computes the number of
connected components and the first Betti number of a semi-algebraic set
defined by compact objects in @xmath which are simply connected. This
algorithm improves the well-know method using a triangulation of the
semi-algebraic set. Moreover, the algorithm has been efficiently
implemented which was not possible before. The second algorithm computes
efficiently the real intersection of three quadratic surfaces in @xmath
using a semi-numerical approach.
