developing quantified interest rate models are introduced and analyzed.
Moreover, the classification of interest rate models is introduced to help
audiences understand the intrinsic ideology behind each type of models.
  In the third chapter of the thesis, the related mathematical knowledge is
introduced. This part has the contribution on understanding the terms and
relation among terms in each model introduced previously.
  In the fourth part of the thesis, the renovation of HJM frame work is
introduced and analysis has been initiated.
