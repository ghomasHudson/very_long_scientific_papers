In this thesis we compute motivic classes of hypertoric varieties,
Nakajima quiver varieties and open de Rham spaces in a certain
localization of the Grothendieck ring of varieties. Furthermore we study
the @xmath -adic pushforward of the Haar measure under a hypertoric
moment map @xmath . This leads to an explicit formula for the Igusa zeta
function @xmath of @xmath , and in particular to a small set of
candidate poles for @xmath . We also study various properties of the
residue at the largest pole of @xmath . Finally, if @xmath is
constructed out of a quiver @xmath we give a conjectural description of
this residue in terms of indecomposable representations of @xmath over
finite depth rings.

The connections between these different results is the method of proof.
At the heart of each theorem lies a motivic or @xmath -adic volume
computation, which is only possible due to some surprising
cancellations. These cancellations are reminiscent of a result in
classical symplectic geometry by Duistermaat and Heckman on the
localization of the Liouville measure, hence the title of the thesis.
