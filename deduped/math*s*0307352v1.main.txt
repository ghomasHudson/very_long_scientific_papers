## 1 Introduction

We recall from elementary number theory the notion of multiplicative
order. If @xmath and @xmath are coprime natural numbers, then there is a
smallest positive integer @xmath such that @xmath , this integer @xmath
is the multiplicative order of @xmath , ord @xmath , and divides @xmath
, where @xmath is Euler’s totient (discussed more extensively in the
next section). We say that @xmath is a primitive root of the
multiplicative group @xmath of units of @xmath if ord @xmath . This
means that @xmath is cyclic and @xmath is a generator. Let @xmath be a
prime (indeed, throughout we exclusively use the notation @xmath and
@xmath for primes). It is well-known that @xmath is cyclic and hence it
has at least one primitive root. Indeed, if @xmath is a primitive root
mod @xmath , then so are @xmath with @xmath and @xmath coprime and hence
there are @xmath distinct primitive roots mod @xmath . Let us denote
them by @xmath with @xmath and @xmath . In their paper [ 5 ] the Dence
brothers consider symmetric functions of the primitive roots of primes.
They consider for example

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (1)
  -- -------- -- -----

and show that this quantity, when considered mod @xmath , assumes only
the values in @xmath . They write in particular (p. 79): ‘As a matter of
distribution, we observe that amongst the first 100 primes (beginning
with @xmath ) the residues @xmath of @xmath occur in the ratios @xmath .
The question of what these ratios should be in the limit of infinitely
many primes is an interesting one’. The following table gives the ratios
amongst the first @xmath primes with @xmath (thus beginning with @xmath
).

Table 1: Value distribution of @xmath

  ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------
  @xmath            @xmath            @xmath            @xmath

  @xmath            @xmath            @xmath            @xmath

  @xmath            @xmath            @xmath            @xmath

  @xmath            @xmath            @xmath            @xmath

  @xmath            @xmath            @xmath            @xmath

  @xmath            @xmath            @xmath            @xmath

                                                        
  ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------

The sum in ( 1 ) is the second elementary totally symmetric function of
@xmath . For @xmath let us consider more generally @xmath with @xmath
the @xmath th order totally elementary symmetric function in @xmath .

Question 1 . Fix @xmath . As @xmath ranges over the primes, which values
are assumed by @xmath and with what frequency ?

Likewise we consider, for @xmath , the sum

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For this quantity we consider the same question:

Question 2 . Fix @xmath . As @xmath ranges over the primes, which values
are assumed by @xmath and with what frequency ?

One of the motivations of this M.Sc. thesis is to resolve these
questions. Interestingly, we will see that symmetric functions in
primitive roots are closely related with some important objects in
number theory; cyclotomic polynomials and Ramanujan sums. Both
cyclotomic polynomials and Ramanujan sums arise in many contexts and
hence we devote separate sections to them.
We will see that the question of the Dence brothers naturally leads to
the study of the value distribution of Ramanujan sums and of that of
coefficients of cyclotomic polynomials. These two issues have not been
well studied in the literature. Regarding the value distribution of
Ramanujan sums we could only find an almost forgotten paper by the
famous analyst Aurel Wintner [ 25 ] , which we reconsider in § 7 .
Regarding the value distribution of coefficients of cycltomic
polynomials, we reconsider a paper by Herbert Möller [ 12 ] in § 8 and
establish some new results.

## 2 Preliminaries

### 2.1 Multiplicative functions

An arithmetic function is a function from the natural numbers to the
complex numbers. A very important subclass of these functions are the
so-called multiplicative functions . These functions satisfy @xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Möbius function and Euler totient function are important examples of
multiplicative functions. If @xmath is a multiplicative function, then
so is @xmath with @xmath . Indeed, more generally, if @xmath and @xmath
are two multiplicative functions, so is @xmath , which is the so called
Dirichlet convolution of @xmath and @xmath . If @xmath is the prime
factorisation of @xmath and @xmath is multiplicative, then we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

A closely related formula is the following one; if @xmath is absolutely
convergent and @xmath is multiplicative, then

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (2)
  -- -------- -- -----

The latter identity is known as Euler’s product identity .
If @xmath is multiplicative, then it is an easy observation that

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (3)
  -- -------- -- -----

for all integers @xmath and @xmath , where @xmath denotes the greatest
common divisor of @xmath and @xmath and @xmath the lowest common
multiple. Likewise we define @xmath and @xmath , were we put @xmath and
@xmath . Conversely, a function that satisfies the functional equation (
3 ) is said to be semi-multiplicative . It can be shown [ 20 ] that if
@xmath is semi-multplicative, there exists a non-zero constant @xmath ,
a positive integer @xmath , and a multiplicative function @xmath such
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is easy to see that if @xmath is semi-multiplicative and @xmath is a
constant, then also @xmath is semi-multiplicative in @xmath .

### 2.2 The Möbius function

Let @xmath be an integer having prime divisors @xmath . Then the Möbius
@xmath function is defined as follows:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Note that @xmath and that @xmath iff @xmath is squarefree. The Möbius
function satisfies the following identity:

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (4)
  -- -------- -- -----

An integer @xmath is said to be @xmath th powerfree if @xmath is not
divisible by a @xmath th power of some integer @xmath . Later we will
need the following identity.

###### Proposition 1

For any natural number @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

First proof. Using the multiplicativity of the Möbius-function one sees
that the left hand side is a multiplicative function of @xmath . It thus
suffices to evaluate it when @xmath is a prime power. Now

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

from which the result follows. @xmath
Second proof. Write @xmath , with the number @xmath @xmath th power
free. Then the sum under consideration equals @xmath . The result then
follows by ( 4 ). @xmath

An important formula involving the Möbius function is the celebrated
Möbius inversion formula . It states that @xmath iff @xmath . The Möbius
function often arises in combinatorial problems, we will see several
examples in this M.Sc. thesis. In Section 6 some auxiliary functions
involving the Möbius function are considered.

### 2.3 The Euler totient function

The Möbius function often arises in combinatorial problems where
so-called inclusion and exclusion is being used in counting. We
demonstrate this by deriving an identity for Euler’s totient function
@xmath , which is defined as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proposition 2

Let @xmath denote the number of integers @xmath that are divisible by
@xmath . Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof . Suppose @xmath is an integer. In the expression @xmath , the
integer @xmath is counted in those @xmath for which both @xmath and
@xmath . It is counted with weight @xmath But, using ( 4 ), we see that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus @xmath . In case @xmath , then @xmath . On using that @xmath is a
multiplicative function, the result then follows. @xmath

From Proposition 2 we easily infer that @xmath is a multiplicative
function. Alternatively this can be easily deduced on using the Chinese
remainder theorem.
For later use we note that by Proposition 2 we have

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (5)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath . Note that as @xmath runs over all integers, @xmath will
run over all squarefree divisors of @xmath . In particular, ( 5 )
implies that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

### 2.4 Roots of unity

An @xmath th root of unity is a solution of @xmath in @xmath . Note
there are precisely @xmath solutions; @xmath , with, of course, @xmath .
Instead of @xmath one often writes @xmath with @xmath . Indeed,
throughout this M.Sc. thesis we adopt the notation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

An @xmath th root of unity is said to be a primitive root of unity if it
is of the form @xmath with @xmath and @xmath coprime (which we will
denote by @xmath ). Such a primitive root of unity has the property that
it does not satisfy an identity of the form @xmath with @xmath a divisor
@xmath of @xmath .

Example . For @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are the primitive roots of
unity. Note that @xmath is not a primitive @xmath th order root of unity
as it satisfies the identity @xmath .

Note that there are @xmath primitive @xmath th roots of unity. The roots
of unity form a cyclic group of order @xmath . The primitive roots of
unity correspond with the generators of this group.

## 3 Ramanujan sums

The Ramanujan sum @xmath is defined by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Although Ramanujan was not the first to work with Ramanujan sums, he was
the first tor realize their importance and use them consistently
(especially in the theory of represenation of numbers as sum of squares,
see e.g [ 8 , Chapter IX] ). The next proposition lists some of the
important properties of Ramanujan sums. (These properties are all known
or well-known except perhaps the formula in part 6, for which we do not
have a reference.) By @xmath we will denote the exponent of @xmath in
@xmath , that is we have @xmath iff @xmath and @xmath .

###### Proposition 3

1) We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

2) We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

3) We have @xmath and @xmath .

4) We have @xmath .

5) We have @xmath if @xmath ; i.e. @xmath is multiplicative with respect
to @xmath .

6) The function @xmath is semi-multiplicative in @xmath . For fixed
squarefree @xmath , the function @xmath is multiplicative in @xmath .
For arbitrary natural numbers @xmath and @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

7) The following orthogonality relations hold (when @xmath and @xmath ):

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof . 1) Consider @xmath . Clearly this expression equals @xmath if
@xmath and zero otherwise. Expressing @xmath in terms of Ramanujan sums
we obtain @xmath , which by Möbius inversion gives @xmath . On using
that @xmath if @xmath and vanishes otherwise, the stated formula
follows.
2) This result, due to O. Hölder, follows from property 1 on using ( 5 )
(see e.g. Exercise 1.1.14 of [ 16 ] ).
3) This is a consequence of property 2 and formula ( 5 ).
4) First proof. Immediate by property 1. Second proof. The Ramanujan sum
can be considered as an element of the field extension @xmath . It is
invariant under each of the automorphisms @xmath with @xmath coprime to
@xmath . Hence it is in the fixed field of @xmath , which is @xmath ,
since @xmath is Galois. Since @xmath is an algebraic integer, the
Ramanujan sum must even be an integer.
5) First proof. We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where we use the observation that the set of congruences classes of the
form @xmath , with @xmath and @xmath for @xmath and @xmath , consists of
@xmath distinct congruence classes mod @xmath , all of them coprime with
@xmath .
Second proof. The assumptions on @xmath and @xmath imply that @xmath .
Now note that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where in the last step we use the multiplicativity of @xmath .
6) The semi-multiplicativity is immediate from what has been said in
Section 2.1 and property 2. The second assertion is an easy consequence
of property 2 and the observation that if @xmath is multiplicative, then
@xmath is a multiplicative function in @xmath . The proof of the third
assertio uses in addition to the previous proof ingredients the
multiplicativity of @xmath .
7) For a proof see e.g. p. 17 of [ 22 ] . @xmath

An arithmetic function @xmath is said to be an @xmath function of @xmath
if @xmath for all @xmath (for a survey see [ 4 ] ). By Property 2 @xmath
and hence Ramanujan sums are even. By Property 4 we can alternatively
define @xmath .
An optimality property of Ramanujan sums was discovered by Bachman [ 2 ]
. If @xmath is any real number, he showed that for any sequence of real
numbers @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It follows that if we consider the infimum of the left handside over all
sequences @xmath with @xmath this is assumed in case @xmath for all
@xmath .
For some further properties of Ramanujan sums, such as for example the
Brauer-Rademacher identity, we refer to Chapter 2 of [ 10 ] .

### 3.1 Density and order of growth

If @xmath is a set of natural numbers, by @xmath we denote the limit of
@xmath (as @xmath tends to infinity) if this exists. Let @xmath denote
the number of primes @xmath . Recall that the prime number theorem
asserts that asymptotically @xmath (for a much stronger version see
Lemma 3 below). If @xmath is a set of prime numbers, by @xmath we denote
the limit of @xmath (as @xmath tends to infinity) if this exists.
If @xmath and @xmath are two functions defined on a set @xmath , then we
shall write @xmath (we say @xmath is of order @xmath ) if the ratio
@xmath is bounded for all @xmath . If the ratio @xmath tends to zero for
@xmath tending to a specified value @xmath (which may be infinite), then
we shall write @xmath . The symbols @xmath and @xmath are commonly
called Landau symbols .

### 3.2 Ramanujan expansions of arithmetic functions

Ramaujan sums play a key role in the theory of Ramanujan expansions .
For completeness we discuss this topic, though this will be not needed
in the rest of this thesis.
Let

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

denote the mean-value of @xmath (if it exists). The Ramanujan sums have
the following orthogonality property which is easily deduced from
Property 7 of Proposition 3 :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

On certain spaces of arithmetic functions there is an inner-product
@xmath and this product suggests Ramanujan expansions @xmath for
arithmetic functions @xmath in a suitable Hilbert space with
coefficients @xmath . Indeed, Ramanujan showed that for example

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath denotes the number of representations of @xmath as a sum of
two squares and @xmath as usual the Riemann zeta function (for Re @xmath
we have @xmath and for all other @xmath in the complex plane @xmath can
be uniquely defined by analytic continuation). Rearick [ 20 ] proved
that if @xmath is an arithmetical function and an associated function
@xmath is defined by @xmath such that @xmath , then we have, with @xmath
, that the series @xmath converges absolutely for each @xmath and we
have @xmath . For a readable survey on Ramanujan expansions, see e.g. [
21 ] , for more detailed information see [ 22 ] .

### 3.3 Ramanujan sums and Dirichlet series

Given an arithmetic function @xmath an important quantity in analytic
number theory is the associated generating series, @xmath , which is
usually named after Dirichlet. If we take @xmath , we obtain

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By property 1 of Proposition 3 we have @xmath and hence

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and so

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

(This proof is due to Estermann, for Ramanujan’s (longer) proof see [ 8
, p. 140] ). Taking @xmath we obtain in particular

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which shows in a striking way the oscillation of @xmath about its
‘average’ @xmath . (It is not difficult to show that @xmath as @xmath
tends to infinity:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for which it follows that @xmath .)
Similarly one can consider @xmath . Invoking property 1 of Proposition 3
again, one easily obtains that @xmath .
In § 7 the Dirichlet series @xmath features (with @xmath a non-negative
integer). Define

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (6)
  -- -------- -- -----

Using Properties 5 and 2 of Proposition 3 and Euler’s product identity,
one infers that, for Re @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It follows that

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (7)
  -- -------- -- -----

## 4 Cyclotomic polynomials

The @xmath th cyclotomic polynomial, @xmath , is defined by

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (8)
  -- -------- -- -----

Note that the roots of @xmath are precisely the primitive @xmath th
roots of unity. Clearly @xmath is a monic polynomial of degree @xmath .
We write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is the coefficients @xmath that later will have our special
attention. Using induction with respect to @xmath it is not difficult to
show that @xmath (see e.g. [ 16 , Exercise 1.5.24] ). Note that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By applying Möbius inversion one infers from this that

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (9)
  -- -------- -- -----

Thus, for example,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Furthermore, it is known that @xmath if @xmath is odd and @xmath where
@xmath is the squarefree kernel of @xmath . The latter two properties
are the reason that some authors in this area restrict themselves to
@xmath squarefree and odd. A further important property is that for
@xmath we have @xmath . It is not difficult to infer these three
properties from ( 9 ). In terms of the coefficients these properties
imply (respectively):

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (10)
  -- -------- -- ------

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (11)
  -- -------- -- ------

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It can be shown that @xmath is irreducible over @xmath . This has as
consequence that the degree of the cyclotomic field @xmath over @xmath
equals @xmath . Over finite fields the cyclotomic fields factor in
general. Indeed, over @xmath , @xmath has @xmath distinct irreducible
factors if @xmath . If @xmath , then @xmath if and only if the order of
@xmath is @xmath (Proposition 18 below). This can be used to infer the
infinitude of primes @xmath [ 16 , Exercise 1.5.30] .
Note that the coefficient, @xmath , of @xmath equals

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the last equality follows from Property 5 of Proposition 3 . Since
@xmath for @xmath , we conclude that @xmath . Another connection between
cyclotomic polynomials and Ramanujan sums is given by the following
result due to Nicol [ 18 ] .

###### Proposition 4

We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using cyclotomic polynomials we can give an easy proof of Property 1 of
Proposition 3 . We take the logarithmic of the right hand side of ( 8 )
and compare its Taylor series with that obtained on taking the logarithm
of the right hand side of ( 9 ). The details are left to the reader.

### 4.1 On the size of the coefficients of cyclotomic polynomials

The size of the coefficients of cyclotomic polynomials is a much
researched topic. This presumably stems from wonder over the fact that
so often the coefficients are in @xmath . Indeed, only for @xmath some
coefficients outside this range appear. For example, we have @xmath .
The amazement over the smallness of @xmath was eloquently worded by D.
Lehmer [ 9 ] who wrote: ‘The smallness of @xmath would appear to be one
of the fundamental conspiracies of the primitive @xmath th roots of
unity. When one considers that @xmath is a sum of @xmath unit vectors
(for example @xmath in the case of @xmath and @xmath ) one realizes the
extent of the cancellation that takes place’.
Migotti showed in 1883 that @xmath , with @xmath and @xmath odd primes.
On the other hand Emma Lehmer showed that @xmath can be arbitrarily
large (with @xmath and @xmath odd primes). Sister Marion Beiter put
forward in 1971 the conjecture that in fact @xmath for all @xmath and
for any @xmath and that this bound is best possible. This conjecture
remains unsolved, for some recent progress see [ 3 ] .
Let us put @xmath . For small values of @xmath , Möller [ 13 ] gave a
method to compute @xmath . The next table (taken from [ 13 ] ) gives
some values of @xmath .

Table 2: Value of @xmath for @xmath

  -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The table suggests that @xmath for every @xmath , this is however very
far from the case: Bachman [ 1 ] extended work of several earlier
authors and showed that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (12)
  -- -------- -- ------

In the opposite direction, let us put @xmath . Erdös has shown that
there exists a @xmath and that there are infinitely many @xmath such
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

On the other hand it is known that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the constant @xmath is best possible. So the conspiration of the
primitive roots of unity is not always that efficient !
Jiro Suzuki [ 23 ] proved the following beautiful result, which we
present with a slightly shortened proof. Proposition 17 , using a
slightly more involved argument, strengthens Suzuki’s result.

###### Proposition 5

We have @xmath .

Proof . Given any integer @xmath it is a consequence of the prime number
theorem (cf. the proof of Proposition 9 ) that it is possible to find
primes @xmath such that @xmath . Let @xmath be any prime @xmath . If
@xmath is even, let @xmath , otherwise let @xmath . We claim that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (13)
  -- -------- -- ------

The claim shows that @xmath . By ( 11 ) we have @xmath . On noting that
@xmath the result follows. We next prove ( 13 ). By ( 30 ) and the
observation that @xmath and that for @xmath , @xmath , we infer that mod
@xmath we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (14)
              @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

This concludes the proof. @xmath

The basic idea of this proof seems to have been first formulated by I.
Schur in a letter to E. Landau. He used it to show that @xmath can be
arbitrarily large.
A very readable survey on properties of coefficients of cyclotomic
polynomials is provided by [ 24 ] .
In this thesis we are especially interested in how often certain values
are assumed by @xmath for small fixed @xmath (§ 8 ), where @xmath either
runs over all integers @xmath or over the numbers of the form @xmath
with @xmath a prime (§ 9.3 ).

## 5 Primitive roots

We already stated that for every prime @xmath there exists a primitive
root @xmath mod @xmath and that all other primitive roots mod @xmath are
of the form @xmath with @xmath coprime to @xmath . Since @xmath are all
distinct mod @xmath , there are precisely @xmath distinct primitive
roots mod @xmath .
Emil Artin conjectured in 1927 that for every integer @xmath not equal
to @xmath or a square, there are infinitely many primes @xmath such that
@xmath is a primitive root. More precisely, he conjectured that the set
of primes @xmath for which @xmath is a primitive root has a density
which should equal a rational multiple of @xmath , the Artin constant,
which is defined as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Artin’s conjecture was proved in 1967 under the assumption of the
Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) by C. Hooley. In our consideration
of the problem stated in the introduction, the constant @xmath will also
arise. Artin’s constant (and indeed many similar ones) can be evaluated
with many decimals of precision by expanding it in terms of values of
the Riemann zeta-function evaluated at integers exceeding one, see e.g.
[ 15 ] . We return to the Artin primitive root conjecture in Section
6.2.2 .

## 6 Some sums involving the Möbius function

Two important auxiliary quantities that will arise are, for given
positive integers @xmath and @xmath , are the sums

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (16)
  -- -------- -- ------

A number of the form @xmath with @xmath fixed is said to be a shifted
prime . Note that we can restrict to the case where @xmath and @xmath .
The case @xmath can be dealt with by fairly elementary analytic number
theory. The case @xmath is rather harder, in the case of shifted primes
providing a non-trivial estimate would be considered a major achievement
by the experts we consulted.

### 6.1 Counting squarefree integers

In this section we are concerned with estimating the first sum appearing
in ( 16 ).

###### Lemma 1

Let @xmath be an integer. We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the implied constant is absolute.

Proof . We have, by inclusion and exclusion,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath denotes the number of integers @xmath that are coprime with
@xmath . Note that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and hence @xmath . On using the latter estimate we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where we used that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath . @xmath

We also need to estimate @xmath . Estimating this quantity turns out to
be much harder. The quantity @xmath is the summatory function of the
Möbius function and this function is called the Mertens function . The
prime number theorem is known to be equivalent with the assertion that
@xmath . The celebrated Mertens’ conjecture states that @xmath for every
@xmath . If this conjecture would hold, then from the easily proved
equality

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

it would follow that @xmath has no zeros with Re @xmath , i.e. the
Riemann Hypothesis would follow. In fact, the Riemann Hypothesis is
known to be equivalent with the assertion that @xmath for every @xmath .
In 1986 Odlyzko and te Riele disproved the Mertens conjecture. The
behaviour of @xmath is thus closely related to the zero free region of
the Riemann zeta function. The largest known zero free region of @xmath
, due to Korobov, was used by Walfisz to show that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In this work we will be satisfied with merely determining the average of
@xmath :

###### Lemma 2

We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the implied constant may depend on @xmath .

To prove the lemma, we will apply the Wiener-Ikehara Tauberian theorem
in the following form.

###### Theorem 1

Let @xmath be a Dirichlet series. Suppose there exists a Dirichlet
series @xmath with positive real coefficients such that
(a) @xmath for all @xmath ;
(b) the series @xmath converges for Re @xmath ;
(c) the function @xmath can be extended to a meromorphic function in the
region Re @xmath having no poles except for a simple pole at @xmath .
(d) the function @xmath can be extended to a meromorphic function in the
region Re @xmath having no poles except possibly for a simple pole at
@xmath with residue @xmath .
Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In particular, if @xmath is holomorphic at @xmath , then @xmath and
@xmath as @xmath .

Proof of Lemma 2 . We apply the Wiener-Ikehara theorem with @xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Of course @xmath satisfies the required properties and has a simple pole
at @xmath with residue one. Since the finite product in the formula for
@xmath is regular for Re @xmath , the result follows on using the
well-known fact that @xmath can be extended to a meromorphic function in
the region Re @xmath (and hence @xmath ). @xmath

### 6.2 Counting squarefree shifted primes

In this section we are concerned with estimating the second sum in ( 16
).

#### 6.2.1 On a result of Mirsky

Theorem 2 below is due to Mirsky [ 12 ] (with the difference that in his
version the @xmath -constant depends at most on @xmath and @xmath ). In
his paper Mirsky states two theorems, of which he only proves the first
(the proof of the second being similar). Mirsky’s second theorem is
stated below. For completeness we give the proof here. Recall that the
letters @xmath and @xmath are used to indicate primes.

###### Theorem 2

Let @xmath be any non-zero integer, @xmath any integer greater than
@xmath , and @xmath any positive number. Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the @xmath -constant depends at most on @xmath and @xmath .

Our proof rests on the Siegel-Walfisz theorem:

###### Lemma 3

[ 19 , Satz 4.8.3] . Let @xmath denote the number of primes @xmath with
@xmath . Let @xmath be arbitrary. Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

uniformly for @xmath , @xmath , where the constants depend at most on
@xmath .

Note that if @xmath there is at most one prime @xmath . If @xmath , then
the above result implies that @xmath , thus asymptotically the primes
are equidistributed over the primitive congruence classes mod @xmath .

Proof of Theorem 2 . The dependence of O-constants on @xmath and @xmath
is indicated by using them as index, thus @xmath means that the implied
constant depends at most on @xmath .
Let @xmath . By Proposition 1 we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (17)
              @xmath   @xmath      (18)
              @xmath   @xmath      (19)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

say. We have, using Lemma 3 with @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (20)
              @xmath   @xmath      (21)
              @xmath   @xmath      (22)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

Clearly

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (23)
  -- -------- -- ------

By Euler’s product identity we have

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (24)
  -- -------- -- ------

Using that @xmath and the classical estimate @xmath , we obtain

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (25)
  -- -------- -- ------

On combining ( 20 ) with ( 23 ), ( 24 ) and ( 25 ), we infer that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Note that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where in the second sum the summation is over all integers @xmath
satisfying @xmath . On adding the estimates for @xmath and @xmath , the
result follows from ( 17 ). @xmath

#### 6.2.2 Connection with Artin’s primitive root conjecture

By Theorem 2 the density of primes @xmath such that @xmath is squarefree
equals @xmath , the Artin constant. The Artin constant also arose in
Section 5 in the context of primitive roots. This raises the question
whether there is some connection between the two problems. We will now
show that this is indeed the case; both problems are in fact special
cases of a generalization of Artin’s primitive root conjecture. We
assume some familiarity with algebraic number theory.
We recall that a prime @xmath splits completely in @xmath iff @xmath .
Note that @xmath is squarefree iff @xmath with @xmath any prime. It
follows that @xmath is squarefree iff @xmath does not split completely
in any of the fields @xmath with @xmath a prime. It is a consequence of
Chebotarev’s density theorem that the density of primes @xmath that
split completely in a normal extension @xmath equals @xmath , where
@xmath denotes the degree of the extension. On noting that the
compositum of @xmath , where @xmath are distinct primes, equals @xmath ,
we expect by inclusion and exclusion that the density of primes @xmath
for which @xmath is squarefree equals

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Indeed, the primes @xmath for which a given integer @xmath with @xmath
or a square is a primitive root mod @xmath can be described in a similar
way. Here we want that for each prime @xmath with @xmath we have that
@xmath , which can be reformulated as @xmath does not split completely
in @xmath for any prime @xmath . By inclusion and exclusion we expect
then that that the density of primes @xmath for which @xmath is a
primitive root equals

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (26)
  -- -------- -- ------

In fact Hooley proved in 1967 that the number given in ( 26 ) is indeed
the correct density, under the assumption of GRH. For squarefree @xmath
the degree @xmath is generically equal to @xmath , which is the exact
degree of @xmath and hence the arisal of @xmath in both problems does
not surprise us.
Both problems considered here are in fact special cases of the following
generalization of Artin’s primitive root problem. This generalization
was first studied by Goldstein and later by M. Ram Murty [ 17 ] . Let
@xmath be an algebraic number field. Let @xmath be a family of number
fields, normal and of finite degree over @xmath . Determine the number
of prime ideals @xmath of @xmath such that @xmath and which do not split
completely in any element @xmath of @xmath . On taking @xmath and @xmath
to be the set of fields of the form @xmath , where @xmath runs over the
primes, we obtain Artin’s primitive root problem. On taking @xmath and
@xmath to be the set of fields of the form @xmath , where @xmath runs
over the primes, we obtain the special case of Mirsky’s result
considered above.
From an heuristical point of view the arisal of Artin’s constant in the
squarefree problem is not surprising. The density of primes @xmath such
that @xmath is @xmath . Imposing the condition @xmath for each prime
@xmath and assuming all the conditions to represent independent events,
one arrives at @xmath as the expected density of the primes @xmath with
@xmath squarefree. The independence of the various local conditions is a
consequence of the fact that for any two distinct primes @xmath and
@xmath we have @xmath .
For the Artin problem we impose the local condition that @xmath does not
satisfy both @xmath and @xmath . The density of primes @xmath not
satisfying the latter two conditions is @xmath . If the conditions for
the various primes @xmath would be independent, we would expect (as
Artin original did) the density to equal

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (27)
  -- -------- -- ------

which if @xmath equals a rational number times the Artin constant.
However, it is not always true (with @xmath and @xmath as before) that
@xmath (for example when @xmath , @xmath and @xmath in which case the
intersection equals @xmath ) and hence we expect the density to come out
different from ( 27 ) sometimes (as can be shown true assuming GRH).

#### 6.2.3 A variation of Mirsky’s result

We will need a variation of Mirsky’s result for @xmath and @xmath . Let
@xmath be a (possibly empty) finite sequence of primes satisfying @xmath
. We write @xmath . We say that a number @xmath is @xmath -squarefree if
@xmath for every prime @xmath with @xmath . We put

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If @xmath is the empty set, then @xmath .

###### Proposition 6

Let @xmath be any non-zero integer, Let @xmath and @xmath be natural
numbers. Write @xmath . We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the @xmath -constant depends at most on @xmath and @xmath .

Proof . A variation of Theorem 2 and left to the reader. @xmath

Remark . Again the constant appearing in this result is not surprising.
For each prime @xmath we impose a condition at our prime @xmath
occurring in the sum: if @xmath we prescribe @xmath and if @xmath we
require that @xmath . If for fixed @xmath we compute the densities of
primes satisfying this condition and if we multiply all these ‘local
densities’ together, we arrive at the density

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which equals the density given in Proposition 6

#### 6.2.4 A conjecture

It is generally believed that primes @xmath are such that @xmath does
not have a preference with regards to having an even or odd number of
prime factors. In other words, the following conjecture (thought to be
deep by the experts) is generally believed: we have @xmath as @xmath
tends to infinity. We propose a slightly more general conjecture.

###### Conjecture 1

Let @xmath be any non-zero integer, Let @xmath and @xmath be natural
numbers. We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the @xmath -constant depends at most on @xmath and @xmath .

All the numerical data we came across in this respect seemed to be not
inconsistent with this conjecture.

## 7 Value distribution of Ramanujan sums

We discuss the value distribution of @xmath as @xmath varies over the
integers and @xmath is fixed. We do this following Aurel Wintner’s paper
[ 25 ] . Wintner argues that the prime number theorem is equivalent with
the Möbius function having an asymptotic distribution function and notes
that @xmath . A natural question arising then is whether @xmath for
@xmath fixed has an asymptotic distribution function and if so, what it
looks like. We next recall some facts regarding moments and distribution
functions.

### 7.1 Distribution functions

A sequence @xmath is said to have an asymptotic distribution function ,
@xmath , if there exists a monotone function @xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

holds at every continuity point @xmath of @xmath and, moreover, we have
@xmath and @xmath . It is known that if @xmath , it has an asymptotic
distribution @xmath iff @xmath exists for every @xmath ; in which case

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

(We define @xmath and hence @xmath .) Given a distribution function
@xmath we can consider, @xmath , the Fourier-Stieltjes transform of
@xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If the moments exist for every @xmath , then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is valid for every @xmath . In the case where there are only finitely
many distinct elements in ths sequence (which will happen in our
application), @xmath will be a step function making only finitely many
steps. Then @xmath will be a finite expression of the form @xmath and
the values assumed are then @xmath , each with density @xmath .
As an illustration let us compute the asymptotic distribution for @xmath
. By now the reader should have no difficulties in proving directly that
this is merely the step function which has the saltus (‘jump’) @xmath at
@xmath , respectively. Let us derive this by the method of moments. The
odd moments of @xmath are zero and the @xmath th moment with @xmath
equals @xmath . The zeroth moment equals one. We thus derive that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

from which we arrive at the same conclusion as before.

### 7.2 Computing the moments and asymptotic distribution function

Using the representation ( 7 ) for the Dirichlet series @xmath and
@xmath and the Wiener Ikehara theorem, Theorem 1 , the mean of the
@xmath th moment of @xmath can be determined (note that by property 5 of
Proposition 3 we can take @xmath in that result when we apply it to
@xmath ), We find that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (28)
  -- -------- -- ------

Note that @xmath is a multiplicative function in @xmath . Similarly, we
have @xmath . (We use the subscript @xmath in @xmath to indicate that
the mean is with respect to @xmath .) Since @xmath and hence the same
inequality holds for the mean, it follows that the radius of convergence
of the power series

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (29)
  -- -------- -- ------

is infinite for every @xmath . In case @xmath , @xmath is easily
evaluated using ( 28 ) and ( 6 ). One obtains

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Note that if @xmath is fixed, then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For any given @xmath it is not difficult to compute @xmath using formula
( 28 ). The existence of all the moments @xmath , @xmath implies the
existence of an asymptotic distribution function @xmath . Note that
@xmath and that @xmath . The values assumed are @xmath , each with
density @xmath . Thus, taking @xmath for example we immediately read off
from the formula for @xmath that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

## 8 Value distribution of cyclotomic coefficients

### 8.1 Evaluating cyclotomic coefficients

Write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We consider the value distribution of the cyclotomic coefficients @xmath
for fixed @xmath , as @xmath runs over all the positive integers. By
setting @xmath whenever @xmath is not an integer we have, for @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (30)
  -- -------- -- ------

Note that, for @xmath , we have

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (31)
  -- -------- -- ------

where we used the observation that, for @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (32)
  -- -------- -- ------

From ( 31 ) it is not difficult to derive a formula for @xmath for a
fixed @xmath ; this is just the coefficient of @xmath in the right hand
side of ( 30 ) (this approach seems to be due to D.H. Lehmer [ 9 ] ). We
thus obtain, for @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

More generally, we have

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (33)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the sum is over all partitions @xmath of all the integers @xmath
with @xmath and over all @xmath with @xmath for @xmath . Using this
result we will deduce that the @xmath dependence of @xmath is not that
strong.

###### Proposition 7

Put @xmath . We can uniquely decompose @xmath as @xmath with @xmath and
@xmath and @xmath natural numbers. There exist functions @xmath and
@xmath with as domain the divisors of @xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof . The assertion regarding the uniqueness of the decomposition
@xmath is trivial. For a given @xmath only those partitions @xmath
contribute to ( 33 ) for which @xmath is an integer for @xmath . Note
that @xmath . Thus, we can write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If @xmath , then none of the integers @xmath is squarefree and @xmath ,
so assume that @xmath . On using that @xmath with @xmath either equals
@xmath or @xmath , the result follows from ( 33 ). @xmath

The above proposition shows that @xmath is a finite set, thus if we fix
@xmath , there are only finitely many possibilities for the values of
the coefficient of @xmath in a cyclotomic polynomial. We will now show
that @xmath and @xmath are always amongst these values. In the formula
for @xmath there is always the term @xmath . Let us take @xmath , where
@xmath only has prime divisor @xmath . Then all the terms of the form
@xmath with @xmath are zero (since either @xmath or @xmath is not
squarefree) and we obtain that @xmath , where @xmath as usual denotes
the number of primes @xmath not exceeding @xmath . In particular, it
follows that @xmath always assumes the values @xmath and @xmath .
Combining this insight with the previous proposition we arrive at the
following result.

###### Proposition 8

Let @xmath be fixed. Let @xmath and let @xmath be any prime exceeding
@xmath . We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using formula ( 10 ) it is seen that in the latter proposition @xmath
can be replaced by @xmath . We have @xmath . See Table 2 for the values
of @xmath for @xmath .
We next show that the inclusion in Proposition 8 is strict for @xmath .
Our proof rests on the following rather elementary result on prime
numbers.

###### Proposition 9

For @xmath there are consecutive odd primes @xmath such that @xmath .

Proof . Breusch proved in 1934 that for @xmath there is at least one
prime in @xmath (this strengthens Bertrand’s Postulate asserting that
there is always a prime between @xmath and @xmath , provided @xmath ).
Let @xmath . A little computation shows that the above result implies
that for @xmath there is at least one prime in @xmath . One checks that
the assertion is true for @xmath . Assume that @xmath . Let @xmath be
the largest prime not exceeding @xmath and let @xmath and @xmath be
primes such that @xmath and @xmath are consecutive primes. Then @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath . On noting that @xmath , the proof is then completed.
@xmath

###### Proposition 10

For @xmath we have @xmath (and thus @xmath ).

Proof . Let @xmath and @xmath be odd primes satisfying the condition of
Proposition 9 . Using ( 30 ) we infer that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where we computed modulo @xmath . It follows that @xmath . The proof is
completed on invoking Proposition 8 . @xmath

#### 8.1.1 Numerical evaluation of @xmath for small @xmath

For our purposes it is relevant to be able to numerically evaluate
@xmath for small @xmath and large @xmath . A computer package like Maple
evaluates @xmath be evaluating the whole polynomial @xmath . For large
@xmath this is far too costly. Instead it is more efficient to use ( 30
) and expand for every @xmath for which @xmath , @xmath as a Taylor
series up to @xmath and multiply all these series together. The most
efficient method to date is due to Grytczuk and Tropak [ 7 ] . First
they apply formula ( 10 ). Thus it is enough to compute @xmath with
@xmath squarefree. If @xmath , then @xmath , so we may assume that
@xmath . Let @xmath . Put @xmath . Compute @xmath recursively by @xmath
and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then @xmath . The proof uses the formula

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (34)
  -- -------- -- ------

which follows by Viete’s and Newton’s formulae from ( 8 ) and it uses
Property 2 of Proposition 3 . An alternative proof of ( 34 ) is obtained
on using the following observation together with Property 1 of
Proposition 3 .

###### Proposition 11

Suppose that, as formal power series,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

then @xmath .

Proof . Taking the logarithmic derivative of @xmath we obtain

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

whence the result follows. @xmath

For every integer @xmath it is a consequence of Proposition 5 that there
exists a minimal integer @xmath , @xmath , such that there exists a
natural number @xmath with @xmath . Grytczuk and Tropak [ 7 , Table 2.1]
used their method to determine @xmath for the integers in the interval
@xmath . Gallot has extended this range from @xmath . From Table 11 one
can determine @xmath for the range @xmath .

### 8.2 Möller’s paper reconsidered

In this section we reconsider Möller’s paper [ 13 ] . In Möller’s
approach @xmath is connected with partitions of @xmath . A partition of
a positive integer @xmath is an expression of the form @xmath with all
the @xmath . Ordering is disregarded. Thus, @xmath and @xmath are
considered to be the same partitions of 7. A partition can be identified
with a sequence @xmath of non-negative integers satisfying @xmath .
W.l.o.g. we can denote a partition, @xmath , of @xmath as @xmath , where
@xmath (thus the number @xmath occurs @xmath times in the partition).
The set of all partitions of @xmath will be denoted by @xmath . The
number of different partitions of @xmath is denoted by @xmath . Hardy
and Littlewood in 1918, and Uspensky independently in 1920, proved that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proposition 12

[ 13 , Satz 2] . We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof . The taylor series of @xmath equals, for @xmath , @xmath , where
@xmath . Using this we infer that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (35)
  -- -------- -- ------

The proof now follows from ( 35 ) and ( 30 ). @xmath

Our proof above shows that the formula given in Proposition 12 is a
triviality, whereas Möller’s ingenious and rather involved proof of it
obscures this.
Möller uses Proposition 12 to show that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

exists and gives a formula for it. To do so he first determines the
average of @xmath . He does this by expanding it out as a sum of terms
of the form @xmath with @xmath , which is possible by ( 36 ). The
average of each term @xmath is easily determined. He then invokes
Proposition 12 and uses combinatorics to simplify his expressions. His
final result is still quite complicated and we did not feel inclined to
check its equivalence with our more simple formula in Theorem 3 below.
We will now follow Möller’s trail, in spirit, but not in detail and see
where it leads us.

###### Proposition 13

Let @xmath , @xmath be distinct integers and @xmath . If @xmath we let
@xmath be the largest integer @xmath for which @xmath , otherwise we let
@xmath . Let @xmath and @xmath . We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Corollary 1

We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof of Proposition 13 . Put

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Comparison of ( 32 ) and ( 35 ) yields

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (36)
  -- -------- -- ------

Note that for @xmath the binomial coefficient is only non-zero if @xmath
. Using ( 36 ) it follows that a necessery condition for the argument of
@xmath to be non-zero is that @xmath . Now write @xmath . Note that
@xmath if @xmath for @xmath and equals zero otherwise. It is not
difficult to show that @xmath and using this, that @xmath are squarefree
iff @xmath is squarefree. It follows that if @xmath , then @xmath and we
are done, so next assume that @xmath . We infer that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let us first consider the (easy) case where @xmath . Then we obtain
@xmath . If @xmath is odd, then by Lemma 2 it follows that @xmath and we
are done, so next assume that @xmath is even. Then we apply Lemma 1 and
obtain that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The assumption @xmath implies that @xmath .
Next we consider the case where @xmath . The corresponding binomial
coefficient is only non-zero if @xmath . Similarly, we must have @xmath
for @xmath . It follows that if it is not true that @xmath , then @xmath
and hence @xmath as asserted, so assume that @xmath . We have

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

On invoking Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 the proof is then completed. @xmath

Proof of Corollary 1 . Follows from a case by case analysis from
Proposition 13 on using ( 36 ). @xmath

###### Theorem 3

We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

@xmath and @xmath .

Proof . The result follows from Proposition 12 together with Corollary 1
. @xmath

In case @xmath is a prime, @xmath for every partition and the above
formula further simplifies. The above formula suggests a connection with
the group or representation theory of the symmetric group @xmath . The
conjugacy classes in @xmath are in 1-1 correspondence with the
partitions of @xmath . If @xmath , then the order of every element in
the corresponding conjugacy class equals @xmath . In particular, @xmath
, where @xmath denotes the maximum of all orders of elements in @xmath .
It was shown by E. Landau in 1903 that @xmath as @xmath tends to
infinity (for a nice account of this see [ 11 ] ), whereas by Stirling’s
theorem @xmath .
From Proposition 12 Möller infers that @xmath . To see this note that
the partitions having 1 occurring at least twice do not contribute if
@xmath . If @xmath , then either @xmath or @xmath . This in combination
with ( 11 ) allows us then to argue as before and leads us to the same
bound. By a much more involved argument, using some analytic number
theory, Möller concludes that @xmath for @xmath . This result was
sharpened by several later authors culminating in Bachman’s estimate (
12 ).
Möller used Proposition 12 to evaluate @xmath for @xmath . He did this
by hand. The outcome is in Table 2. We redid this computation by
computer and arrived the same result. Note that @xmath , with @xmath a
rational number. For @xmath we give the value of @xmath in Table 3 (our
table agrees with the one given in [ 13 ] , except for the incorrect
values @xmath and @xmath appearing there).

Regarding @xmath Möller proposed:

###### Conjecture 2

[ 13 ] . Let @xmath . Write @xmath .
1) We have @xmath .
2) We have @xmath .

Möller stated that with help of an IBM 7090 he wanted to check his
conjecture for further values of @xmath . Had he carried this out, he
would have discovered that @xmath . Other counterexamples occur at
@xmath and @xmath . Indeed, we would not be surprised if part 2 of the
Conjecture is violated for infinitely many @xmath .
On the other hand, part 1 of the Conjecture is true for @xmath . The
numbers @xmath seem to be decreasing to zero and their size seems to be
related to the number of prime factors of @xmath , the more prime
factors the larger @xmath seems to be. In Table 11 (kindly computed by
Yves Gallot) we give values for @xmath for @xmath up to @xmath .

### 8.3 Average and value distribution

We give, using Proposition 7 , a simpler formula for @xmath involving
@xmath for a finite set of @xmath .

###### Theorem 4

Let @xmath be fixed. Put @xmath and let @xmath be any prime. Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Furthermore, when @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof . Let @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . We have

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where we used Proposition 7 and Lemma 2 . On invoking Lemma 1 we then
obtain that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

On noting that @xmath (and @xmath , but this is not needed), the first
formula follows, but with @xmath instead of @xmath . On invoking formula
( 10 ) it is easily seen that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and hence the first formula follows. The proof of the second formula is
similar and left to the reader. @xmath

Using identity ( 11 ) we arrive at the following corollary to this
theorem:

###### Corollary 2

Let @xmath be fixed and odd and @xmath and @xmath as in Theorem 4 . Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Furthermore, when @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

As a corollary of Theorem 4 and Corollary 2 we have:

###### Proposition 14

We have @xmath . In case @xmath is odd we have @xmath .

Yves Gallot observed that actually for @xmath , we have @xmath .

In case @xmath is prime, the divisor sum in the previous corollary can
be further reduced:

###### Proposition 15

Let @xmath be a fixed prime. Put @xmath and let @xmath be any prime.
Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof . We consider the formula given in the previous corollary. The
divisors of @xmath are either of the form @xmath with @xmath or of the
form @xmath with @xmath . For the latter @xmath we find, using ( 10 )
that @xmath and hence @xmath . Now suppose that @xmath . Using
Proposition 12 we infer that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using this observation it follows that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

whence the result follows. @xmath

Clearly @xmath , where the latter sum has only finitely many non-zero
values and it is a finite computation to determine those @xmath for
which @xmath for some @xmath . For @xmath the non-zero values of @xmath
are given in Table 4 (except for @xmath ). A more extensive version of
Table 4 is provided by Table 11.

Table 4: Value of @xmath

           @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath

Let us now look at Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 from the viewpoint of
computational complexity. In Theorem 3 the sum has @xmath terms and the
famous estimate of Hardy and Littlewood yields that @xmath as @xmath
tends to infinity. In Theorem 4 we sum over @xmath terms where @xmath .
So Theorem 3 yields the computational superior method. Theorem 4 is,
however, much more easily implemented. Using Proposition 12 in
combination with Theorem 4 a result comparable with Theorem 3 is
obtained. Indeed, if one starts with Proposition 15 and invokes
Proposition 12 , one obtains a sum over partitions of @xmath , where now
@xmath for example does not occur in the partition. This yields a result
superior in complexity to that provided by Theorem 3 .
As already pointed out by Möller one could use his method to study the
value distribution of @xmath in case e.g. @xmath by considering the
integer @xmath to determine @xmath for example. This then yields a sum
with @xmath terms and this results in an algorithm that has worse
complexity than that provided by Theorem 4 . Aside from this, this seems
to be, from the practical point of view, an unwieldy method.

#### 8.3.1 Some observations related to Table 4

In this section we make some observations regarding Table 4 and Table
11, which is a much more extensive version of Table 4.
Let us put @xmath . Recall that @xmath . Recall also that @xmath . Using
this and Corollary 2 we infer that if @xmath is odd, then @xmath is
symmetric: we have @xmath iff @xmath . For @xmath is even numerical
results suggest that often @xmath is not symmetric. For @xmath it is
true that if @xmath and @xmath is negative, then @xmath . An other
observation that can be made is that for @xmath it is true that @xmath
consists of consecutive integers, i.e. if @xmath are in @xmath , then so
are all integers between @xmath and @xmath .
Let us define @xmath , for @xmath . It is easy to see that always @xmath
. Note that for @xmath is even we have @xmath . For @xmath is odd we
have @xmath iff @xmath . We could also express this as @xmath . Thus in
this case, if we know @xmath , we also know @xmath . Inspection of Table
11 shows that for odd integers @xmath with @xmath often @xmath and
@xmath differ by a factor two. Regarding this situation we have the
following result:

###### Proposition 16

Let @xmath be odd and @xmath . We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof . ‘ @xmath ’ An easy consequence of Corollary 2 . ‘ @xmath ’ This
uses in addition that @xmath . @xmath

Example. Inspection of Table 4 shows that the condition of the
proposition is satisfied for @xmath and @xmath . It thus follows that
there is no even integer @xmath for which @xmath (whereas @xmath ).
Further examples can be derived from Table 5.

Table 5: Set theoretic difference @xmath

  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  -------- -------- -------- --------
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath

  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath

For Proposition 16 to be of some mathematical value we would hope that
infinitely often @xmath is strictly contained in @xmath . The next
result shows that @xmath assumes all values as @xmath and @xmath range
over the integers.

###### Proposition 17

We have @xmath .

Proof . Given any integer @xmath it is a consequence of the prime number
theorem that it is possible to find primes @xmath . Let @xmath and let
@xmath be any prime @xmath . If @xmath is even, let @xmath , otherwise
let @xmath . We claim that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (37)
  -- -------- -- ------

The claim together with @xmath yields the result. We next prove ( 37 ).
Using the observation that @xmath we infer from ( 30 ) that mod @xmath
we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (38)
              @xmath   @xmath      (39)
              @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ------

This concludes the proof. @xmath

The above argument shows for example that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

## 9 Value distribution of @xmath and @xmath

### 9.1 Ramanujan sums, cyclotomic polynomials and primitive roots

Proposition 19 connects the mod @xmath reductions of totally symmetric
functions in primitive roots to totally symmetric functions in primitive
roots of unity. Our proof rests on the following simple result.

###### Proposition 18

Let @xmath be a prime not dividing @xmath . Then @xmath iff the order of
@xmath is @xmath .

Proof . If the order of @xmath equals @xmath , then @xmath for every
@xmath and @xmath . By ( 9 ) we then infer that @xmath . Since there are
@xmath elements of order @xmath in @xmath , the equation @xmath has at
least @xmath distinct solutions mod @xmath , however since the degree of
@xmath equals @xmath , these are all the solutions. @xmath

Remark. We think this proof is more enlighting than that given in [ 16 ,
p. 209] . A related, less well-known result is that @xmath is congruent
to @xmath if @xmath is a primitive root mod @xmath and divisible by
@xmath otherwise [ 18 ] .

###### Proposition 19

Let @xmath be a prime. Put @xmath . Let @xmath be the modulu @xmath
distinct primitive roots. Let @xmath be the natural numbers coprime to
@xmath . Let @xmath be any totally symmetric function in the variables
@xmath . Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof . By Newton’s result on totally symmetric polynomial functions it
is sufficient to prove the result for all elementary totally symmetric
polynomial functions. By Proposition 18 we infer that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (41)
  -- -------- -- ------

On the other hand we have

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (42)
  -- -------- -- ------

From ( 41 ) and ( 42 ), the result easily follows. @xmath

Let @xmath denote the distinct primitive roots mod @xmath with @xmath .
Recall that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and that @xmath is the @xmath th elementary totally symmetric function
in @xmath . By Proposition 19 we infer that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The latter congruence together with part 2 of Proposition 3 then yields
the following lemma.

###### Lemma 4

Let @xmath be a prime. Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This result is due to Moller [ 14 ] , who proved it in a different (and
more roundabout) way. Note that in case @xmath we have @xmath , a result
first established by Gauss [ 6 ] .

If @xmath , then @xmath . If @xmath , then we have, by Proposition 19 ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If @xmath , then @xmath . Taking the results of these three cases
together we infer that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The latter congruence and the congruence @xmath are the starting point
of our analysis of their value distribution which is carried out in the
next two sections.

### 9.2 Value distribution of @xmath mod @xmath

As we have seen @xmath and so instead of the value distribution of
@xmath mod @xmath we can investigate the value distribution of @xmath .
Given a natural number @xmath , let @xmath denote the set of prime
divisors of @xmath , ordered in size. We have @xmath . The following
observation will play an important role.

###### Proposition 20

On each prime @xmath with @xmath prescribed and @xmath (respectively
@xmath ) prescribed, @xmath (respectively @xmath ) assumes the same
value. If @xmath , this value is zero.

Our most general result regarding the value distribution of @xmath reads
as follows.

###### Theorem 5

Let @xmath .
1) For every @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the @xmath -constant depends at most on @xmath and @xmath and
@xmath is a rational number. 2) If we assume in addition Conjecture 1 ,
then the density of primes @xmath with @xmath exists and equals @xmath .

Proof . Part 1. Write @xmath . If @xmath for some @xmath , then @xmath
and hence @xmath . It follows there are only finitely many possibilities
for @xmath to be considered. To each of them, by Proposition 20 , we can
associate an unique non-zero value of @xmath . We then have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for some effectively computable set @xmath . The result then follows by
Proposition 6 . Part 2. The proof of part 2 is similar to that of part 1
and left to the reader. @xmath

Conjecture 1 together with Theorem 2 (with @xmath and @xmath ) and the
observation that @xmath , then yields the following result demonstrating
part 2 of Theorem 5 (with @xmath ).

###### Proposition 21

Assuming Conjecture 1 we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Numerically we find up to the first @xmath primes ‘densities’ of @xmath
, @xmath and @xmath respectively (for @xmath ). This should be compared
to the conjectural values @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , respectively.

We demonstrate part 1 of Theorem 5 in Table 6 for @xmath , where we took
@xmath such that @xmath and rounded the result in the column ‘numerical’
to the sixth decimal.

  @xmath   @xmath        @xmath      @xmath

Let @xmath be a prime and let @xmath for some @xmath . By Lemma 4 and (
5 ) we deduce

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (43)
  -- -------- -- ------

As regards to the average size of @xmath we have the following result.

###### Theorem 6

Let @xmath be any natural number, and @xmath any positive real number.
Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the @xmath -constant depends at most on @xmath and @xmath .

###### Corollary 3

The average of @xmath over the primes @xmath is a multiplicative
function in @xmath .

Thus the average of @xmath is a semi-multiplicative function in @xmath .
The analog of this for the natural number case also holds true: @xmath
is a semi-multiplicative function in @xmath (we leave this as an
exercise to the reader).

Proof of Theorem 6 . Let us denote by @xmath the density of primes
@xmath such that @xmath . By Lemma 3 one infers that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By property 6 of Proposition 3 , Proposition 6 , the remark following
Proposition 6 and ( 43 ), we infer that the theorem holds with a
constant given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

On evaluating this constant, the result follows. @xmath

Theorem 6 is demonstrated in Table 7 (with again @xmath such that @xmath
).

  ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------

Our most general result in this section concerns the moments of @xmath .

###### Theorem 7

Let @xmath be a natural number.
1) . Let @xmath be a positive real number and @xmath be a positive real
number. Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the @xmath -constant depends at most on @xmath and @xmath .
2) . If we assume Conjecture 1 and @xmath is an odd natural number, then
we have @xmath , where the @xmath -constant depends at most on @xmath
and @xmath .

Proof . Part 1. Proceeding as in the proof of Theorem 6 we infer that
the result holds with constant

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which is easily seen to equal the claimed constant.
Part 2. Similar to the proof of Theorem 5 . @xmath

Remark. If in part 1 we take the limit for @xmath tending to one, then
we obtain Theorem 6 .

### 9.3 Value distribution of @xmath mod @xmath

Recall that @xmath . It follows that @xmath . A presumably difficult
question is to investigate under which conditions equality holds here. A
related question is what the set @xmath looks like (cf. Suzuki’s result
in Section 4.1).

First we consider the value distribution of @xmath for some small values
of @xmath . When @xmath we have @xmath and hence for this case we refer
to the previous section. Note that @xmath . In the remainder of this
section we assume that @xmath (some of the assertions will also be valid
for @xmath ). Using Lemma 4 we infer that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the latter identity is Theorem 3 of [ 5 ] . By ( 5 ) we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

On using this we infer that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (44)
  -- -------- -- ------

(For notational convenience we will write @xmath for @xmath .) Since
@xmath it follows that the reduction of @xmath mod @xmath is in @xmath .
The following assertion conjecturally resolves the question of the Dence
brothers stated in the introduction.

###### Proposition 22

We have, assuming the validity of Conjecture 1 ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proof . Equation ( 44 ) suggests to consider the primes @xmath with
@xmath and @xmath separately. Note that for @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The latter quantity we (conditionally) evaluated in Proposition 21 . It
follows that the density of primes @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath
equals @xmath and that the density of primes @xmath such that @xmath and
@xmath equals @xmath .
The case @xmath can be dealt with Proposition 6 (with @xmath , @xmath

By Newton’s formula @xmath can be expressed as a polynomial in @xmath
with @xmath . To be precise, we have

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (45)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the sum extends over all solutions @xmath of @xmath . Next we
consider @xmath . Taking @xmath in ( 45 ) we compute

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Invoking Lemma 4 a more explicit formula for @xmath can then be derived.
With @xmath we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In each of these cases Proposition 6 and Conjecture 1 yield the
densities with which the values @xmath and @xmath are assumed. The
results are summed up in Table 9.

Adding up the various contributions we infer the following result.

###### Proposition 23

We have, assuming the validity of Conjecture 1 ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Similarly, for @xmath we find, with @xmath and @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Proceeding as before we infer the following result.

###### Proposition 24

We have, assuming the validity of Conjecture 1 ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The above approach of dealing with the value distribution of @xmath for
small @xmath clearly becomes more laborious as @xmath increases. The
following result is more systematic; it is analogous to Theorem 4 .

###### Theorem 8

Let @xmath be fixed. Let @xmath and let @xmath be any prime. Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If @xmath , then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In both cases the @xmath -constant depends at most on @xmath .

Proof . Put @xmath . Let @xmath be the set of primes not exceeding
@xmath and @xmath . Furthermore, let @xmath . We first consider @xmath .
Let @xmath and suppose that @xmath satisfies @xmath . Since @xmath , it
follows that @xmath . Note that @xmath . Conjecture 1 implies now that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (46)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the o-constant depends at most on @xmath .
Next we consider

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (47)
  -- -------- -- ------

By Proposition 6 we then find that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using Proposition 7 we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

From the latter formula in combination with ( 46 ) and ( 47 ), we infer
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

On noting that @xmath and using ( 10 ), the proof of the first assertion
is completed. The proof of the second assertion is a variation of the
argument above and left to the reader. @xmath

The latter theorem is demonstrated in Table 10. Using that the sum of
the densities equals one, one can easily find the density of primes for
which @xmath from the table, so we omitted this information. Notice that
the averages given for @xmath are the same as can be inferred from the
earlier presented results on the value distribution of @xmath and @xmath
respectively. The averages given also seem to be consistent with
numerical simulations.

  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   Average
  -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath
  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath

It is not difficult to see that @xmath if and only if @xmath for some
prime @xmath . We infer from the table that there is no prime @xmath
such that @xmath , whereas by Table 4 it follows that @xmath . Indeed,
the example following Proposition 11 shows that there are no even
integers @xmath for which @xmath .

## 10 Open problems

During research usually more questions are being raised than being
resolved and the present work is no exception. We conclude by
formulating some questions. Gallot’s data show that 2, 5 and 9 hold true
for @xmath .
1) Is Conjecture 1 true ?
2) Is Möller’s conjecture that @xmath true ?
3) What is the behaviour of @xmath for large @xmath ?
4) Compute @xmath .
5) Is @xmath ?
6) Determine @xmath .
7) Does @xmath , @xmath , imply there is an integer @xmath with @xmath ?
8) Is @xmath infinitely often ?
9) Is @xmath ?
10) What is the behaviour of @xmath for large @xmath ?
