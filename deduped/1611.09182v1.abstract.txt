This thesis constitutes a first attempt to derive aspects of standard model
particle physics from little more than an algebra. Here, we argue that physical
concepts such as particles, causality, and irreversible time may result from
the algebra acting on itself. We then focus on a special case by considering
the algebra $\mathbb{R}\otimes\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}\otimes\mathbb{O}$.
Using nothing more than
$\mathbb{R}\otimes\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}\otimes\mathbb{O}$ acting on
itself, we set out to find standard model particle representations.
  From the complex quaternionic portion of the algebra, we find generalized
ideals, and show that they describe concisely all of the Lorentz
representations of the standard model. From the complex octonionic portion of
the algebra, we find minimal left ideals, and show that they mirror the
behaviour of a generation of quarks and leptons under $su(3)_c$ and
$u(1)_{em}$. We then demonstrate a rudimentary electroweak model which yields a
straightforward explanation as to why $SU(2)_L$ acts only on left-handed
states. This holds in the case of leptons.
  Finally, we demonstrate how $\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{O}$ can generate a
64-$\mathbb{C}$-dimensional algebra, wherein we find the $SU(3)_c$ irreducible
representations corresponding to three generations of quarks and leptons. We
then conclude by showing how to arrive at all 48 electric charges.
