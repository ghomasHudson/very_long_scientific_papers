This dissertation presents an experimental search for the Standard Model
Higgs boson produced in association to the W boson in proton antiproton
collisions at a center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV and recorded with the
Collider Detector at Fermilab. We improve the sensitivity of the WH search by
17% through increased signal yield by 33% by introducing a novel method to
reconstruct charged lepton candidates based on an isolated track, as well as a
novel method to combine triggers in order to maximize the signal yield and yet
not use an OR between triggers. The observed (median expected) 95% confidence
level SM Higgs upper limits on cross section times branching ratio vary between
2.39 x SM (2.73 x SM) for a Higgs mass of 100 GeV/c^2 to 31.1 x SM (31.2 x SM)
for a Higgs mass of 150 GeV/c^2, while the value for a 115 GeV/c^2 Higgs boson
is that of 5.08 x SM (3.79 x SM).
