## Part I Introduction

### Chapter \thechapter Hawking Radiation

Black holes - so-called because of the apparent impossibility of escape
from them - are not entirely black. That was the surprising claim made
by Hawking [ 1 , 2 ] over thirty years ago. Examining the behaviour of
quantum fields in the vicinity of a black hole, he showed that, far from
being emission-free, it should emit a steady flux of thermal radiation,
with a temperature proportional to @xmath , the gravitational field
strength at the event horizon:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (0.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

With this remarkable result, Hawking completed a thermodynamic treatment
of black holes that had been developed previously by Bekenstein [ 3 , 4
] , who had concluded that the temperature of a Schwarzschild black hole
should be proportional to @xmath [ 3 ] (though his analysis is based
mainly on entropy, and he did not consider the possibility of thermal
emission). The work of Bekenstein and Hawking - and of others [ 5 , 6 ,
7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] , rederiving Hawking’s result in various ways - brings
together the normally disparate areas of gravity, quantum theory and
thermodynamics; a glance at the various fundamental constants appearing
in Eq. ( 0.1 ) makes this fusion clear. Thirst for understanding of the
underlying connections between these mighty realms of physics provides
ample motivation for the study of what has come to be known as Hawking
radiation.

A pre-requisite for any such study must be the acknowledgement that
Hawking radiation is not without its own problems, both practical and
conceptual. On the practical side, the predicted temperature - at least
in the gravitational context in which it was first derived - is
virtually untestable. A solar mass black hole would, according to Eq. (
0.1 ), have a temperature of about @xmath - six orders of magnitude
smaller than the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
Any radiation from the black hole would be drowned out by the CMB.
Therefore, experimental verification of black hole radiation would seem
to require an unusually light black hole, orders of magnitude lighter
than the Sun - a very unlikely object.

Conceptually, there is the trans-Planckian problem [ 11 , 12 , 13 ] ,
which has to do with the validity of the derivation of Hawking
radiation. Let us briefly explain the problem; it is discussed further
in § 5 . In most derivations, the spacetime is assumed to collapse, as
in a star collapsing to form a black hole. Modes of the quantum vacuum
are incident from infinity, propagating through the collapsing spacetime
and out to infinity again, experiencing a gravitational redshift as they
climb out of the ever-deepening gravitational well. The steady thermal
flux seen at late times can be traced back to those vacuum modes which
just manage to escape the event horizon, slowed and redshifted to
greater and greater degrees. Thus, any low-frequency mode seen in the
late-time thermal spectrum can be traced back to an incident vacuum mode
of ever-increasing frequency; indeed, to an exponentially increasing
frequency! The frequencies of these incident modes very quickly exceed
the Planck scale [ 13 ] , widely believed to be a fundamental quantum
limit. We cannot justify the use of quantum field theory at such scales,
yet it appears that Hawking radiation is dependent on the existence of
these initial trans-Planckian frequencies. Whatever is the correct
physics, can we be sure that it will preserve Hawking radiation?

These difficulties can be tackled by appealing to artificial event
horizons, or physical systems possessing horizons analogous to those of
gravitational black holes [ 14 , 15 ] . This idea was first proposed by
Unruh [ 16 ] , who found that perturbations of a stationary background
fluid flow behave just as a scalar field in Lorentzian spacetime [ 16 ,
17 ] . In particular, if the flow velocity crosses the speed of sound,
the surface where it does so is entirely analogous to a black-hole event
horizon, and on quantizing the perturbation field, one predicts analog
Hawking radiation in such a system. Of course, this model is subject to
the same trans-Planckian problem as the gravitational case. In reality,
however, the trans-Planckian problem tends not to arise, because sound
waves in fluids - or, indeed, propagating waves in any of the
experimentally-realisable analog systems - exhibit dispersion . That is,
the behaviour of waves changes at different scales by mechanisms which
are better-understood than quantum gravity; for example, the sizes of
atoms or molecules places a fundamental limit on the wavelengths of
sound waves. Unruh showed numerically that even after taking
high-frequency dispersion into account (and assuming that the dispersion
is not too strong), Hawking radiation is still predicted, with the same
temperature as in the dispersionless model [ 18 ] . The conclusion is
that the trans-Planckian problem is a mathematical artifact, while the
Hawking radiation exists regardless of the physics at the high-energy
scale. This discovery has prompted a great deal of interest in a range
of black-hole analogue systems: in Bose-Einstein condensates [ 19 , 20 ,
21 , 22 , 23 ] , in ultracold fermions [ 24 ] , in superfluid Helium-3 [
25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 ] , in water [ 30 , 31 , 32 ] , and in optics [
33 , 34 , 35 , 36 ] . These black-hole analogies might not teach us
about quantum gravity directly, but they can give insight into the
particle creation process, hopefully pointing towards the real origin of
Hawking radiation [ 37 ] .

As we shall see, Hawking radiation derives from the conversion of
incident positive -norm vacuum fluctuations into outgoing modes with
negative norm. Determination of the resultant spectrum is achieved
through the calculation of the relevant coefficients (known as
Bogoliubov coefficients ). In the absence of dispersion, Hawking’s
original result is obtained. Unsurprisingly, the introduction of
dispersion complicates the derivation, and its general effects on the
Hawking radiation are not yet clear. It has been shown that, in the
limit of a low velocity gradient or weak dispersion (the adiabatic
limit), Hawking’s prediction is preserved in the low-frequency regime.
This was first demonstrated numerically by Unruh [ 18 ] , using a
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm for wavepacket
propagation and introducing a high-frequency truncation to the
dispersion relation. The result was explained analytically by Brout et
al. [ 38 ] by solving the wave equation in momentum space, where, in the
vicinity of the horizon, the equations become more tractable. Corley and
Jacobson considered stationary modes of a single frequency, reducing the
wave equation to an ordinary differential equation. Thus, they were able
to calculate entire spectra numerically [ 39 , 40 ] , and to
characterise their deviations from thermality. Corley used equations in
momentum space to solve for the stationary modes analytically [ 41 ] ,
using a different dispersion relation from that used by Unruh but coming
to the same conclusion that the Hawking prediction remains valid for low
frequencies in the adiabatic limit. He also found that the spectrum
remains thermal in the non-adiabatic limit, i.e., in the limit of very
large velocity gradient, but that this can still be solved for
analytically [ 40 ] ; a similar result has been demonstrated more
recently in the context of Bose-Einstein condensates [ 42 ] . Further
numerical [ 43 , 44 , 45 ] and analytic [ 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 ] works have
extended the context in various directions, but all are agreed that, in
the adiabatic limit and low-frequency regime, Hawking radiation behaves
as it does in the dispersionless case. While deviations and lowest-order
approximations for the high-frequency regime have been studied [ 47 , 44
] , a general expression for the spectrum valid over the entire
frequency range has never been found; nor has such an expression for the
low-frequency temperature, connecting the adiabatic limit with the
step-discontinuous limit. Furthermore, the regime which contains no
horizon in the dispersionless limit has not yet been explored.

In this thesis, we shall examine two analogue systems. In Part II we
discuss Unruh’s original model of acoustic waves in a moving fluid; in
Part III, we focus on the lesser-known analogy of light in optical
fibres. We shall see that Hawking radiation is robust, remaining when
high-frequency modes are suppressed, and even when there is no event
horizon (in the usual sense); that said, thermality is not so robust,
for only in the dispersionless case is the Hawking spectrum strictly
thermal. We shall see that, in the cases examined, we can find general
analytic expressions for the Hawking spectrum and for the low-frequency
temperature. For the rest of this introduction, we shall use the
acoustic model to examine how black hole analogies arise in theory and
how, in the strictly dispersionless case, Hawking radiation derives from
trans-Planckian vacuum modes.

#### 1 The Schwarzschild metric as a moving medium

General Relativity identifies gravity with curvature of spacetime,
described by the spacetime metric @xmath . It has a unique spherically
symmetric vacuum metric: the Schwarzschild metric [ 50 ] , which in
coordinates @xmath takes the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the angular line element, @xmath is the Schwarzschild
time coordinate and @xmath is the Schwarzschild radius. This describes,
for example, the spacetime around a star or planet with relatively low
rotation rate. As @xmath , the Schwarzschild metric approaches the flat
Minkowski metric, so the coordinates @xmath correspond to the usual
spherical coordinates of flat spacetime for an observer at infinity.
However, Eq. ( 1.1 ) contains two singularities, at @xmath and @xmath .
The singularity at @xmath is a genuine singularity of Schwarzschild
spacetime [ 50 ] ; we shall not be concerned with it here. It is the
surface @xmath - the event horizon - that is of interest to us.

Let us briefly review the effects of the event horizon by examining
light trajectories, or null curves, with @xmath . Since the spacetime is
spherically symmetric, we shall not concern ourselves with angular
trajectories, so we also set @xmath . This leaves us with a differential
equation for the null curves:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Far from the Schwarzschild radius, where @xmath , @xmath , so that light
behaves just as it does in flat spacetime. However, as we approach the
Schwarzschild radius, @xmath diverges: light takes longer and longer to
travel any distance, and, if travelling towards the event horizon, can
never reach it in a finite time @xmath . The time @xmath comes to a
standstill at the event horizon.

Despite this peculiar behaviour, the event horizon is not a genuine
singularity of Schwarzschild spacetime; it simply appears as such in the
coordinates @xmath , which are unsuited to the region @xmath . The
Schwarzschild time @xmath is the main culprit, for we may follow in the
footsteps of Painlevé [ 51 ] , Gullstrand [ 52 ] and Lemaître [ 53 ] by
defining a new time,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

this has the differential

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

which, when substituted in Eq. ( 1.1 ), yields the metric

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the coordinates @xmath , the metric clearly has no singularity at
@xmath . (It is true that the coefficient of @xmath vanishes there, but
this is easily remedied by considering a new position coordinate @xmath
such that @xmath , so that @xmath . This is not too important, however,
and we can gain a more intuitive understanding of the metric by keeping
@xmath as our position coordinate.) Notice that, while the definition of
@xmath , Eq. ( 1.3 ), is applicable only when @xmath , the metric of Eq.
( 1.5 ) is easily extendable to all values of @xmath greater than zero.
The new coordinate @xmath has opened up a previously inaccessible region
of the spacetime. Keeping @xmath fixed while decreasing @xmath , we see
from Eq. ( 1.3 ) that, as we approach the Schwarzschild radius, we must
have @xmath to compensate for the divergence of the logarithm. Thus,
with respect to our original coordinates, the transformation to the
coordinates @xmath is accompanied by an extension of the spacetime into
the infinite future. Our discussion of light trajectories anticipated
this: since an ingoing light ray approaches the horizon at an infinitely
slower rate (with respect to @xmath ), crossing the horizon requires
@xmath .

Let us take a moment to interpret the metric ( 1.5 ). Again, we shall
consider only radial trajectories, setting @xmath . The key point to
note is that, if @xmath , the metric reduces to @xmath . @xmath , then,
is the proper time measured by an observer on the trajectory @xmath .
Since this condition clearly maximises @xmath , these trajectories are
geodesics, and @xmath measures proper time along them. It is as though
space consists of a fluid [ 54 , 55 ] , flowing inwards with velocity
@xmath to converge on the point @xmath . The geodesics just defined are
those which are stationary with respect to this fluid. The coordinate
@xmath , defined above, is constant on such a geodesic, and can be
thought of as the proper spatial coordinate; its differential, combining
@xmath and @xmath , is derived from simple addition of velocities (which
can be done in the Galilean fashion since all velocities are measured
with respect to the proper time @xmath ). The fluid should be thought of
as the fabric of space itself, for the speed of light is measured with
respect to it. At the Schwarzschild radius, the fluid flows inward with
speed @xmath ; anything that falls beneath this radius will inexorably
be dragged towards the centre, @xmath . This view is reinforced by
looking at the radial null curves in the coordinates @xmath . Setting
@xmath and @xmath , we find two possible trajectories for light:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.6)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

The forms of these trajectories near the point @xmath are shown in
Figure 2 . The first possibility represents rays which are ingoing with
respect to the fluid; the total velocity is @xmath , the sum of the
light’s velocity and the fluid’s velocity. It is perfectly regular at
the horizon, and tilts over as it propagates, travelling faster and
faster as it moves to ever smaller radii. The second possibility
represent rays which are outgoing with respect to the fluid, having a
total velocity of @xmath . This is not regular at the horizon, nor
should it be: there, the competing velocities of the fluid and the light
exactly cancel, giving a total velocity of zero. Rays at higher radii
will have a positive total velocity, and will eventually escape to
infinity; rays at smaller radii will have a negative total velocity,
unable to overcome the fluid flow, and will propagate inwards to @xmath
.

This analogy with a moving medium forms the basis of artificial black
holes and event horizon analogies. We may simply replace @xmath in Eq. (
1.5 ) with the more general velocity profile @xmath to obtain, in @xmath
-dimensional spacetime, the metric

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where now @xmath is to be interpreted as the velocity with respect to
the medium in question (not necessarily the speed of light). For
example, this generalized metric may be applied to a system so far
removed from astrophysics as a river flowing towards a waterfall, so
that the flow speed increases in the direction of flow, as illustrated
in Figure 3 . Imagine this river is populated by fish who can swim only
up to a maximum speed @xmath ; this speed is, of course, with respect to
the water, not the coordinate @xmath . Then the above metric suffices to
describe the trajectories of fish in this river. Fish who are far from
the waterfall, where the current is low, are free to swim around as they
please, experiencing no significant resistance in either direction.
However, as the current increases, there may be a point at which @xmath
. As the fish approach this point, they will find it increasingly
difficult to swim back upstream; passing this point, motion upstream is
impossible, for the current is so strong that the fish, no matter how
hard or in which direction they swim with respect to the water, are
doomed to be swept over the waterfall. The point where @xmath is the
event horizon, and the trajectories of fish swimming at exactly the
speed @xmath are analogous to the trajectories of light near a black
hole horizon (see Eqs. ( 1.6 ) and Fig. 2 ).

It is important to note that the existence of a point at which @xmath
does not necessarily imply that the metric ( 1.7 ) is equivalent to a
black hole spacetime. Nothing can escape from a black hole once the
horizon is crossed; more precisely, the region where the flow is
superluminal ( @xmath ) flows away from the horizon. But the opposite is
also possible: starting with a black hole-like spacetime and performing
the transformation @xmath - or, equivalently, @xmath - we find that the
superluminal region flows towards the horizon. This is a white hole
spacetime, the time-reverse of a black hole spacetime, and white hole
trajectories are simply time-reversed black hole trajectories.
Therefore, all light rays initially in the superluminal region are
dragged towards the horizon. Those moving counter to the flow will come
to a standstill there: whether on the superluminal or subluminal side,
they will approach the horizon asymptotically, never actually reaching
it. In the river analogy, this is equivalent to water flowing from a
waterfall, so that its flow is initially very fast but slows as it
travels; this is shown in Figure 4 . The horizon is again where @xmath .
Fish far from the waterfall, where the current is low, may come and go
as they please; but as they travel upstream, they will find it
increasingly difficult to continue, and must come to a standstill at the
horizon.

The white hole is of limited use in astrophysics. It is encoded in
Schwarzschild spacetime, from which it is derived by changing the sign
of the @xmath -dependent terms in Eqs. ( 1.3 )-( 1.5 ), but it extends
the spacetime into the inifinite past. Therefore, its validity requires
that the Schwarzschild metric is valid for @xmath , which is seldom the
case, for black holes are believed to form from gravitational collapse.
However, turning away from gravity to the more general case of moving
media, white holes are just as realisable as black holes, and we shall
make use of them in Part III when we discuss light in optical fibres.

#### 2 The acoustic field and its wave equation

Having now shown the spacetime metric ( 1.7 ) of a moving medium to be
analogous to that of a Schwarzschild black hole, let us study the
behaviour of fields in such a spacetime. For simplicity, we shall assume
a massless scalar field; in the context of a fluid, such a field may
arise from small perturbations in the background flow [ 16 , 14 ] . If
the fluid is irrotational (as it must be in one spatial dimension), the
flow velocity may be expressed as the derivative of a potential: @xmath
. Variations in pressure and density (i.e., sound waves) give rise to
small deviations @xmath . We shall treat the background flow as constant
in time, and the small variations as the independent field @xmath ,
which will be referred to as the acoustic field. Being massless, the
acoustic field has speed @xmath with respect to the medium; since this
holds for all frequencies, this implies that the fluid is
dispersionless. (Dispersion is introduced in Part II.)

Let us begin with the Principle of Least action: the acoustic field
@xmath varies from one configuration to another in such a way that the
action integral is an extremum (usually a minimum). The action is the
integral of the Lagrangian:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

so all the physics of the model is contained in the Lagrangian, @xmath .
An extremum of the action is found by infinitesimally varying the field
@xmath and its derivatives, @xmath and @xmath , then setting the
resulting variation in @xmath to zero. This yields the Euler-Lagrange
equation:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Being scalar and massless, the Lagrangian for the acoustic field is [ 56
]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

@xmath is the inverse metric tensor, and @xmath is the determinant of
the metric tensor @xmath . Using the metric ( 1.7 ), the Lagrangian
becomes

  -- -- -- -------
           (2.4)
  -- -- -- -------

and plugging this into the Euler-Lagrange equation yields the wave
equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Solutions of the wave equation are more easily derived once its
conservation laws have been identified. These are directly related to
symmetries of the Lagrangian. There are two nontrivial symmetries of the
Lagrangian ( 2.4 ). One is time translation: @xmath is invariant under
the transformation @xmath . This leads to conservation of frequency;
more precisely, it implies the existence of stationary modes of the form
@xmath , which are examined in § 3 below. The other symmetry is phase
rotation: @xmath is invariant under the transformation @xmath , where
@xmath is a real constant. This implies conservation of the scalar
product, defined as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.6)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where @xmath and @xmath are both solutions of the wave equation ( 2.5 ),
and the canonical momentum

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The scalar product of a solution with itself is of particular
importance, and is called the norm .

A general solution to the acoustic wave equation ( 2.5 ) is easily
found. We define new variables @xmath and @xmath as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Then, after some algebra, we find that the wave equation in the
coordinates @xmath is simply

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

So, in the absence of horizons where @xmath , @xmath is simply a sum of
two arbitrary functions, one a function of @xmath only, the other a
function of @xmath only:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.10)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

With respect to the fluid, @xmath is right-moving while @xmath is
left-moving. The fact that the two functional forms maintain their
shapes is a consequence of the absence of dispersion: all wave
components have the same velocity, @xmath , with respect to the fluid,
and so does the waveform as a whole. The only ambiguity is in the
direction of travel; thus the solution splits into a right-moving and a
left-moving part.

If horizons are present, the coordinates @xmath and @xmath defined in
Eqs. ( 2.8 ) do not cover the entire spacetime, so that extra
coordinates - and hence extra functions in the general solution ( 2.10 )
- must be added. This is examined in greater detail in § 5 .

#### 3 Stationary modes

The general solution ( 2.10 ) ceases to apply when dispersion is
introduced (although the labels @xmath and @xmath , representing waves
which are right- and left-moving with respect to the fluid, continue to
be useful). However, even with dispersion, the symmetries of the
Lagrangian described above remain valid, as do their corresponding
conservation laws. We shall present here a more comprehensive form for
the general solution: a linear superposition of stationary modes.

As previously mentioned, the invariance of the Lagrangian under time
translation implies the existence of solutions of the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

called stationary modes . In the present case of no dispersion, Eq. (
2.10 ) implies that the spatial part of the solution takes the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.2)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

It thus splits into two independent parts, one right-moving and one
left-moving with respect to the fluid. Defining the local wavevector
@xmath such that @xmath , we see that

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

which are summarized by the relation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

This formula is very intuitive once we recognise that @xmath is related
to the free-fall frequency @xmath (i.e., the frequency measured in the
frame in which the medium is at rest) via the Doppler formula: @xmath .
Equation ( 3.4 ), then, is simply @xmath - the dispersion relation in
the free-fall frame. Comparing with Eqs. ( 3.3 ), we see that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Consider the stationary modes

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

with canonical momenta

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

The scalar product between @xmath -modes is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.8)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where the last line is found by making the substitution @xmath , and the
integration is taken over the whole real line of @xmath . If @xmath is
nowhere zero, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the @xmath -
and @xmath -axes, and the integration thus extends over all @xmath .
(When @xmath for some @xmath , the mode must be split between separate
regions; this is dealt with in § 5 .) Similarly, the scalar product
between @xmath -modes is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.9)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where the last line is found via the substitution @xmath , and the
integration is taken over the entire @xmath -axis. (Again, if @xmath for
some @xmath , the mode must be split into regions; see § 5 .) Finally,
we remark that the @xmath - and @xmath -modes are orthogonal to each
other, as are modes and their conjugates:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

Notice, from Eqs. ( 3.8 ) and ( 3.9 ), that the sign of the norm is
equal to the sign of the wavevector @xmath for @xmath -modes, but to
minus the sign of @xmath for @xmath -modes. More succinctly, with the
use of Eq. ( 3.5 ), the sign of the norm is equal to the sign of the
free-fall frequency:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

This correspondence continues to hold in dispersive systems.

We may redefine the stationary modes so that they are normalized: for
@xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.12)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.13)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

so that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

A complete set of modes must include the complex conjugates of these.
According to Eq. ( 2.6 ), complex conjugation changes the sign of the
scalar product:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Finally, then, any solution of the wave equation ( 2.5 ) can be written
as a linear superposition of modes:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (3.17)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

#### 4 Quantization of the acoustic field

Having expressed the acoustic field in terms of orthonormal modes, it is
readily quantized via the usual methods of Quantum Field Theory [ 56 ] .
Firstly, however, we note that the physical acoustic field is a
real-valued quantity, so that we may write Eq. ( 3.16 ) in the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.1)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where @xmath stands for complex conjugate. We may now promote the
real-valued field variable @xmath to the Hermitian operator @xmath , the
coefficient variables @xmath to annihilation operators @xmath and the
complex conjugate coefficient variables @xmath to creation operators
@xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.2)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where @xmath stands for Hermitian conjugate. We also have a Hermitian
operator for the canonical momentum:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

These may be inverted, as in ( 3.17 ), to find expressions for the
annihilation and creation operators:

  -- -- -- -------
           (4.4)
  -- -- -- -------

where the Hermitian conjugate gives the operator @xmath and a similar
expression holds for the @xmath -mode operators.

To complete the quantization, the commutators of the various operators
must be specified. This is done for @xmath and @xmath , the other
operators following suit. We define

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Then the annihilation and creation operators obey the Bose commutation
relations

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

all other commutators being zero.

#### 5 Event horizon

Suppose there exists a point at which @xmath . Since the flow is to the
left at precisely the wave speed with respect to the flow, the total
speed of right-moving waves here is zero. This is an event horizon for
right-moving waves.

Let us suppose that the event horizon is situated at the origin, @xmath
; and, moreover, that the derivative of @xmath is non-zero there. Then
we may approximate the flow velocity to first-order in @xmath as
follows:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

If @xmath , the magnitude of the velocity increases in the direction of
flow; this is equivalent to a black hole horizon. However, if @xmath ,
the speed decreases in the direction of flow, and we have a white hole
horizon. We shall assume in what follows that @xmath , so that we have a
black hole. It should be borne in mind that the white hole is entirely
analogous, and behaves as the time reverse of a black hole.

Equation ( 2.10 ) states that waves which are right-moving with respect
to the fluid are described by the arbitrary function @xmath , where
@xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

the second equality holds in the vicinity of the horizon. It is evident
from Eq. ( 5.2 ) that a horizon is located at @xmath , for the space is
divided into two separate regions, with @xmath marking the boundary
between them. To see this, imagine first that we have a wavepacket
centred at a certain value of @xmath , and that this is located, at a
certain time, at a positive value of @xmath . If @xmath increases, then
@xmath must increase by exactly the same amount, and so @xmath
increases. Since @xmath is positive, @xmath itself increases, and the
wavepacket moves to the right. Similarly, if we trace the wavepacket
back in time by decreasing @xmath , @xmath must also decrease by the
same amount, and @xmath decreases; the wavepacket has come from the
left. But the logarithm diverges to @xmath at the origin; this means
that, no matter how far back in time we look, @xmath can be decreased by
a corresponding amount without @xmath ever becoming negative . The
wavepacket must have originated arbitrarily close to the event horizon,
moving very slowly forwards at first, picking up speed the further it
travels. (The trajectories are precisely those plotted on the right-hand
side of Fig. 2 @xmath .) If the horizon has existed since the infinite
past, then the wavepacket could never have been in the left-hand region
(where @xmath is negative). Since this applies to the entire wavepacket,
it also implies that the wavepacket must initially have been arbitrarily
thin; or, equivalently, that it must have originated from arbitrarily
short wavelengths. This is precisely the trans-Planckian problem.

Exactly the same analysis holds in the left-hand region, but in the
opposite direction. Any wavepacket that exists there moves to the left,
and must have originated arbitrarily close to the left-hand side of the
horizon. If the horizon has existed since the infinite past, then at no
point in the past could the wavepacket have been located at a positive
value of @xmath . Moreover, the further back in time the wavepacket is
traced, the thinner it becomes. (This corresponds to the left-hand side
of Fig. 2 @xmath .)

Since a complete set of modes must be able to account for the existence
of waves throughout all space, there must be two separate @xmath -modes
for each frequency, one for each of the regions separated by the
horizon:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.3)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.4)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The modes of Eqs. ( 5.3 ) and ( 5.4 ) are normalized according to Eq. (
3.14 ). The change in sign of the exponent between the right-hand and
left-hand regions comes about because of the change in sign of @xmath
(see Eq. ( 3.12 )); it ensures that both @xmath and @xmath have positive
norm.

#### 6 Out-modes and in-modes with an event horizon

The modes @xmath and @xmath - defined above for the case of an event
horizon for @xmath -modes - are not unique. Each has the same frequency
(in the observer’s frame) as the complex conjugate of the other.
Therefore, any linear combination of one with the complex conjuate of
the other is itself a stationary mode. In order to normalize such a
linear combination, we simply employ the linearity of the scalar
product:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So, if @xmath , the linear combination @xmath is normalized with
positive norm; it is also automatically orthogonal to any such
combination involving a different frequency or the modes @xmath and
@xmath , since the individual modes are orthogonal to these. Therefore,
any set of modes

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (6.1)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

form a complete set of orthonormal, positive-norm @xmath -modes. A
transformation between different sets of modes is called a Bogoliubov
transformation .

Despite the limitless possibilities, very few of these sets of modes are
useful. We should deal only with those sets of modes which correspond to
possible measurements. Consider the simplest example: @xmath , @xmath .
This, of course, is simply the set of localized modes given in Eqs. (
5.3 ) and ( 5.4 ). As we have seen, these modes correspond to single
outgoing wavepackets. An outgoing phonon travelling to the right with
frequency @xmath is precisely an excitation of the mode @xmath ;
similarly, a phonon travelling to the left with frequency @xmath is an
excitation of @xmath . They differ in this respect from the other linear
combinations, which correspond to two outgoing wavepackets rather than
just one. In light of this property, the set of modes @xmath and @xmath
are termed out-modes : they correspond to a single outgoing wave.

We expect that there should also exist a set of modes that correspond to
a single ingoing wave. However, the behaviour of the modes already found
would seem to belie this expectation. As noted in § 5 above, all @xmath
-modes drift away from the horizon; how can we possibly form an ingoing
wavepacket from these? We cannot, of course; not while there is a
horizon. There is a trick, however, due to Unruh and others, which we
borrow from the gravitational case [ 6 , 7 , 57 ] . There, the analysis
normally begins by assuming that a horizon has not always existed, but
forms at some finite time from a collapsing spacetime. The in-modes,
then, are well-defined, for they are constructed in a spacetime where a
horizon has not yet formed. It is found that the results of this
analysis, in which in-modes are defined as positive-norm with respect to
the initial time coordinate, are identical to the results obtained by
ignoring the formation process and defining the in-modes as
positive-norm with respect to the Kruskal coordinate. Now, near @xmath ,
the unit vector defined by the Kruskal coordinate is proportional, but
opposite in direction, to the unit vector defined by the @xmath
-coordinate. Therefore, purely positive-norm modes with respect to the
Kruskal coordinate must be analytic in the upper-half @xmath -plane near
@xmath . This completely defines the in-modes: @xmath , on traversing
the upper-half complex plane to @xmath , simply picks up a phase factor
of @xmath , so that the relative amplitude of the left-hand mode
compared to the right-hand mode is @xmath . After normalizing, we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.3)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The in-modes and out-modes - together with their complex conjugates -
are distinct sets of orthonormal @xmath -modes. Taken together with the
@xmath -modes, they form a complete set of orthonormal modes which are
solutions of the wave equation ( 2.5 ). Therefore, we have two natural
ways of decomposing the @xmath part of the field operator in Eq. ( 4.2 )
when a horizon is present:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.4)
              @xmath   @xmath      (6.5)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Given that these two representations are equivalent, and that we know
the Bogoliubov transformation that relates the in- and out-modes, we
also find that an analogous transformation exists between the quantum
amplitude operators. Plugging the transformation into Eq. ( 6.4 ) and
comparing with Eq. ( 6.5 ), we find:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.6)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

#### 7 Spontaneous creation of phonons

The quantum amplitudes @xmath and @xmath are to be interpreted as
annihilation and creation operators, respectively. That is, the operator
@xmath has the effect of exciting its corresponding mode by a single
quantum, while the operator @xmath has the opposite effect. The vacuum
state is that in which no modes are excited: it is the absence of
“particles”. Since one cannot annihilate an excitation from the vacuum
state, it must vanish when acted on by any annihilation operator.
Mathematically speaking, then, the vacuum state is uniquely defined as
the eigenstate of all annihilation operators with eigenvalue zero:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath denotes the vacuum state.

The vacuum state would seem to depend on the specific set of
annihilation operators - and, hence, on the specific set of orthonormal
modes - used to define it. However, if the positive-norm modes of one
set are formed from linear combinations of positive-norm modes of the
other set - and, equivalently, one set’s negative-norm modes are linear
combinations of the other set’s negative-norm modes - then the
annihilation operators of each set are also linear combinations of each
other. In this case, the vacuum states defined by the two sets of modes
are identical, for all annihilation operators, of either set, give zero
when acting on @xmath . Thus, the vacuum state is uniquely defined by
the space spanned by the positive-norm modes, and is not so sensitive to
the individual modes themselves.

The corollary of the previous statement is perhaps more interesting: two
sets of modes, whose positive-norm elements span different spaces,
define different vacuum states. Although the entire space, combining
both positive- and negative-norm modes (that is, the field operator
@xmath ), is exactly the same, a state which is empty with respect to
one set of modes can look non-empty with respect to another, provided
the elements of one set combine positive- and negative-norm modes of the
other.

This is precisely the situation with the in- and out-modes of Eq. ( 6.3
). We conclude that the vacua defined by these two sets of modes -
called, respectively, the in-vacuum and the out-vacuum - are different.
The in-vacuum is that state which contains no phonons in the infinite
past; since all wavepackets are incoming (travelling towards the
horizon) in the infinite past, this is the same as saying that there are
no incoming phonons. Conversely, the out-vacuum contains no phonons in
the infinite future, and since all wavepackets are outgoing there, this
is equivalent to there being no outgoing phonons. The inequality of the
two vacua means that, if there are no incoming phonons - the in-vacuum
@xmath being the usual, and most natural, assumption for the state -
then there will be outgoing phonons. The event horizon leads to
spontaneous particle creation.

We may show this explicitly using Eq. ( 6.6 ). The expectation value of
right-moving outgoing phonons in the in-vacuum is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.2)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Remarkably, the spectrum of phonons emitted is precisely a bosonic
thermal distribution with temperature @xmath ; replacing fundamental
constants,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

Although the result in Eq. ( 7.2 ) has been derived as a number
expectation value, the appearance of the delta function shows that it is
really a density. In § 13 (and Ref. [ 39 ] ), it is shown that this is
proportional to the spectral flux density,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

the number of phonons emitted per unit frequency interval per unit time.

Due to the symmetry of the transformation ( 6.6 ), the expectation value
of left-moving outgoing phonons is exactly equal to the thermal spectrum
of ( 7.2 ). There is a deeper significance to this than just symmetry,
however. The transformation of the in- and out-operators allows us to
write the in-vacuum explicitly in terms of the out-vacuum. Using the
Fock basis, in which the annihilation and creation operators behave in
the standard way:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (7.5)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

the in-vacuum state is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.6)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where @xmath is a normalizing prefactor defined such that @xmath . The
fact that the out-creation operators appear only in @xmath - @xmath
pairs shows that the radiation, though it looks thermal in the right and
left sides separately, is strongly correlated between the two sides.
Phonons are emitted in pairs, one in the subsonic, the other in the
supersonic region; and a measurement of the number of phonons in any
state on one side of the horizon infers that there are equally many
phonons in the corresponding state on the other side. The left and right
systems, separated by the horizon, are entangled .

#### 8 Conclusion and discussion

The above derivation is quite general, in that it applies to any
spacetime that can be described by the metric ( 1.7 ). Of course, this
includes gravitational black holes (see Eq. ( 1.5 )): using @xmath , we
find that, at the Schwarzschild radius, @xmath , and plugging into Eq. (
7.3 ), we have @xmath - exactly Hawking’s original formula, Eq. ( 0.1 ).

In the absence of dispersion, the event horizon is a well-defined point;
for there is only one wave speed, @xmath , and it is precisely where
@xmath that a horizon is established. Hawking radiation is derived by
linearizing @xmath around this point; and since, as discussed in § 5 ,
any wavepacket can be traced back in time to arbitrary thinness and
arbitrary closeness to the horizon, it does not matter how small is the
region over which this linearized velocity profile is valid. Thus, the
Hawking temperature can depend only on the first derivative, @xmath , of
@xmath at the horizon.

This is no longer true once dispersion is taken into account. In that
case, the wave velocity with respect to the medium is not constant but
varies with frequency. The horizon, then, is no longer so well-defined,
and it is impossible to pick out a single parameter which determines the
Hawking spectrum. Moreover, as has been demonstrated by Unruh [ 18 ] and
as will be shown in Chapter II , an outgoing wavepacket does not
originate from an arbitrarily thin wavepacket squeezed up against its
own horizon. Instead, dispersive effects cause a change in the speed of
the wavepacket as its wavelength is reduced, and the wavepacket turns
around at a shifted frequency, originating from infinity. Thus, with the
introduction of dispersion, we are inclined to ask: does the Hawking
spectrum survive? And if so, what is its shape, and on what parameters
does it depend?

In the next chapter, we formulate the theoretical framework for a
quantized acoustic field, much as in the present chapter, but with
dispersion taken into account. Chapter II examines some ways of finding
the spectrum in specific circumstances, and Chapter II presents some
numerical results. Later chapters extend the analogy to the case of
optical fibres.

## Part II Hawking Radiation in Dispersive Fluids

### Chapter \thechapter The Acoustic Model

In Chapter I , we examined the acoustic model in the absence of
dispersion. We shall now deal with the generalization of this model to a
dispersive fluid. Much of the following treatment is directly analogous
to the analysis of Chapter I . However, the solutions are more
complicated: dispersion leads to the new phenomenon of frequency
shifting, whereby a wavepacket is reflected from a group-velocity
horizon at a different frequency. The trans-Planckian problem is in this
manner avoided, but the solutions are not so tractable as Eq. ( 2.10 ),
nor is the Bogoliubov transformation of Eqs. ( 6.3 ) and ( 6.6 ) so
simple. The present chapter describes the theoretical model; the methods
used to determine its solutions, and some numerical results of these
methods, are left to Chapters II and II .

#### 9 The wave equation and its solutions

Dispersion - which describes a frequency-dependent wave velocity -
manifests itself as a breakdown of Lorentz invariance. The wave
behaviour can no longer be described by a spacetime metric, and we must
instead take the Lagrangian as the starting point. Dispersion is
modelled by the appearance of higher-order derivatives in the
Lagrangian, so we must now write the action integral as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Lagrangian, given in the absence of dispersion by Eq. ( 2.4 ), is
now generalized to [ 18 , 39 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

@xmath describes the dispersive properties of the fluid; as a function
of an operator, we consider it as a Taylor series in that operator. We
require that @xmath is an odd function, so that @xmath contains only
odd-degree derivatives of @xmath .

An extremum of the action is found by infinitesimally varying the field
@xmath and its derivatives @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , etc., then setting
the resulting variation in @xmath to zero. The result is the following
Euler-Lagrange equation:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

Substituting @xmath from Eq. ( 9.2 ) - and using the fact that @xmath is
odd when performing integration by parts - we find the acoustic wave
equation [ 18 ] :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

If @xmath is a polynomial of finite degree, this is a partial
differential equation that can be solved numerically. However, @xmath
need not be of finite degree, and it is useful to express its operation
on @xmath in terms of its Fourier transform [ 18 ] : by definition, we
have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

so that

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.6)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Let us assume for now that the flow velocity @xmath is constant in
space. Then, taking the Fourier transform of Eq. ( 9.4 ) by making the
substitutions @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , we find

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

so that @xmath can only be non-zero when @xmath and @xmath satisfy

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (9.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

This is the generalization to dispersive media of Eq. ( 3.4 ). We see
that the function @xmath simply gives the free-fall frequency, @xmath ,
as a function of the wavevector @xmath . (The sign is determined as in
Eq. ( 3.5 ).) In the absence of dispersion, the relation is one of
direct proportionality: @xmath . Typically, waves exhibit very little
dispersion for low values of @xmath , so that @xmath as @xmath . For
higher values of @xmath , the dispersion can take two basic forms:
superluminal and subluminal. These are defined according to whether the
magnitude of the phase velocity, @xmath , becomes higher or lower than
@xmath as @xmath increases; examples are shown in Figure 5 . Our
specification that @xmath be an odd function means that the fluid (in
its rest frame) is isotropic, for @xmath is simply a spatial inversion
of @xmath .

For a given frequency, the possible (real) values of @xmath can by found
by plotting @xmath and the line @xmath , then reading off their points
of intersection; examples are shown in Figure 6 . (The sign now
determines the sign of the free-fall frequency, and not whether the mode
is on the @xmath - or @xmath -branch.) When the fluid is static, the
possible wavevectors always occur in pairs of opposite sign and
velocity: the @xmath - and @xmath -branches, familiar from the
dispersionless case. When the fluid is flowing, the possible wavevectors
still split into @xmath - and @xmath -branches. But now, as in Fig. 6
@xmath , something else can occur: a given @xmath can have several
different wavevectors on the same branch. It can even have wavevectors
with different signs of the free-fall frequency, and given remarks made
in § 3 , this suggests that a given @xmath may have solutions of
oppositely-signed norm. We should bear this possibility in mind, for it
lies at the heart of the Hawking effect. While the route may not be
obvious at this stage, the fact that mixing of modes of
oppositely-signed norm leads to Hawking radiation in the dispersionless
case (see § 7 ) would suggest that the same is true here.

The case of a constant fluid flow is not particularly interesting, for
any wavepacket, centred around any of the possible solutions of the
dispersion relation ( 9.8 ), simply propagates from one infinity to the
other. The analysis can be performed in any Galilean frame, for the
fluid flow velocity will always be constant. The fact that certain
values of @xmath share the same value of @xmath in a certain reference
frame is of no consequence, because this will not be so in another
reference frame; this mathematical relationship is purely incidental. In
particular, the relationship between @xmath -values with different signs
of the free-fall frequency is physically meaningless and purely a matter
of definition; for, we can always transform to the free-fall frame,
where such a relationship cannot (by definition) occur.

This picture changes radically when the fluid flow velocity is not
constant, but has some spatial dependence. In this situation, we cannot
transform into any Galilean frame without forcing the fluid velocity
profile to take on a time dependence as well as a spatial one. There is
now a naturally preferred reference frame: that in which the fluid
velocity profile is dependent only on position and not on time. The
Killing frequency - that which is conserved - is the value of @xmath
measured in this preferred reference frame. During the propagation of a
wavepacket, @xmath may be forced to change, but it can only change to a
value of @xmath with the same value of @xmath . It is in this frame that
such relationships - including that between different signs of the
free-fall frequency - are physically meaningful.

#### 10 Scalar product

As discussed in § 2 , invariance of the Lagrangian under phase rotation,
@xmath , leads to conservation of the scalar product:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath                     (10.1)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where the canonical momentum is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

As before, the norm is defined as the scalar product of a wave with
itself.

If @xmath is constant, or if two wavepackets are localised in a region
where @xmath is constant, the scalar product takes a simple form. Here,
@xmath and @xmath are related via the dispersion relation in Eq. ( 9.8
), so that @xmath , where, as has already been mentioned, the plus or
minus sign refers to a positive or negative free-fall frequency. Rather
than splitting the dispersion relation into @xmath - and @xmath
-branches, then, we may split it into branches of positive and negative
free-fall frequency. A general solution of the wave equation can be
expressed as a sum of two Fourier integrals, one over each branch:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

The canonical momentum is given by Eq. ( 10.2 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then, applying Eq. ( 10.1 ), we find that the scalar product is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (10.5)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

That is, the two branches of the dispersion relation are decoupled,
contributing separately to the scalar product, and the integrand is
simply the product of the Fourier transforms multiplied by the free-fall
frequency. This formula is particularly useful when calculating the norm
of a wave, in which case it becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (10.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

Conservation of the scalar product, and the norm in particular, is a
very important characteristic of the acoustic wave equation. Much like
conservation of energy and momentum in mechanics, it places a
restriction on the types of evolution that can occur. On quantizing the
acoustic field, normalized modes are multiplied by quantum amplitudes,
and the norm corresponds to the excitation or “particle” number. Taking
this into account, Eq. ( 10.6 ) makes the importance of mixing positive
and negative free-fall frequencies more apparent: these different
spectral components contribute to the norm with different signs (thus
confirming that Eq. ( 3.11 ) continues to hold once dispersion is
introduced). If a positive-norm mode is partly converted into a
negative-norm mode, this must be accompanied by an increase in the norm
from purely positive-norm modes; the positive-norm modes are amplified.
Thus, a positive-norm particle is not converted into a
negative-frequency particle; rather, two particles, one with positive
and one with negative norm, are created, so that the total particle
number increases. If the original state is vacuum, then these pairs of
particles are created out of vacuum fluctuations. This is the process
that gives rise to Hawking radiation.

#### 11 Decomposition into modes

The following analyis is inspired by, and closely follows, that of
Macher and Parentani [ 44 ] .

Let us continue to assume that @xmath is constant. We saw in Eq. ( 10.3
) that we can write @xmath as a sum over the plane waves @xmath , where
@xmath . These two branches of the dispersion relation have a very
simple correspondence - a plane wave on one branch is the complex
conjugate of a plane wave on the other:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, we needn’t worry about there being two branches to the dispersion
relation. For every value of @xmath , we uniquely define @xmath , and
then we include the complex conjugates of the resulting plane waves.
This exhausts the possible modes; that is, they form a complete set of
solutions. (Note that we are presently working in the @xmath
-representation, since we may write an exact expression for @xmath as a
function of @xmath , but not vice versa.)

Before making use of the completeness of this set, we should first
normalise them with respect to the scalar product. Applying Eq. ( 10.1
), we find, for two positive-norm plane waves,

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

while, for two plane waves of oppositely-signed norm,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This agrees with the corresponding result in the dispersionless case
(see § 3 ), where an extra factor of @xmath appears because the delta
function has its argument in @xmath rather than @xmath .

An inspection of Eq. ( 10.1 ) reveals the identities

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (11.1)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (11.2)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Defining the mode @xmath as follows:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (11.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

then the @xmath and their complex conjugates @xmath form a complete
orthonormal set, with

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (11.4)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

We refer to the @xmath as positive-norm modes and to the @xmath as
negative-norm modes . In the free-fall frame, positive-norm modes are
those that:

-   if @xmath , are right-moving (i.e., @xmath -modes);

-   if @xmath , are left-moving (i.e., @xmath -modes).

For negative-norm modes, this correspondence is reversed.

We may now write @xmath in terms of the modes defined in Eq. ( 11.3 ).
As before, we note that @xmath represents a real-valued quantity, so
that the coefficients of complex conjugate modes must themselves be
complex conjugates; we have

  -- -- -- --------
           (11.5)
  -- -- -- --------

with canonical momentum given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (11.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

The orthonormality of the modes, characterised by Eq. ( 11.4 ), allows
us to express the coefficients very simply:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (11.7)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The mode decomposition of the field in Eq. ( 11.5 ) is readily quantized
as before (see § 4 ). We promote the real-valued quantities @xmath and
@xmath to Hermitian operators @xmath and @xmath ; the coefficient of the
positive-norm modes, @xmath , to an annihilation operator, @xmath ; and
the coefficient of the negative-norm modes, @xmath , to a creation
operator, @xmath , the Hermitian conjugate of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (11.8)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (11.9)
  -- -------- -- --------

Imposing the equal time commutation relation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (11.10)
  -- -------- -- ---------

the annihilation and creation operators are found to satisfy the Bose
commutation relations,

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (11.11)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

#### 12 Transforming to the @xmath-representation

Eq. ( 11.8 ) describes the field operator @xmath as an integral over
modes characterised by the wavenumber @xmath . However, since in the
general case of an inhomogeneous velocity profile it is the frequency
@xmath which is conserved rather than @xmath , we would like to change
this to an integral over @xmath , so that each mode is separately
conserved. In the dispersionless case, @xmath and @xmath are directly
proportional, and the transformation is straightforward. In the presence
of dispersion, however, the transformation depends on the dispersion
profile, and one must be careful to include all possible solutions
corresponding to each value of @xmath .

For the sake of example, let us suppose that the dispersion is
subluminal. We need only deal with the integral over the positive-norm
modes, i.e., those modes with @xmath , keeping in mind that this does
not necessarily mean that @xmath is positive (although the free-fall
frequency @xmath certainly is). The cases of supersonic and subsonic
flow are qualitatively different, so let us examine them separately.
(Note that, although the following analysis has been kept fairly
general, it may require some modification given specific examples.)

##### 12.1 Supersonic flow

It is easily seen that, if @xmath and the dispersion is subluminal, then
each value of @xmath corresponds to a single positive-norm mode. (See
Figure 7 .) If @xmath is positive, the positive-norm mode has a negative
value of @xmath , and is therefore left-moving in the free-fall frame;
these are the @xmath -modes. On the other hand, a negative @xmath has a
positive-norm mode with a positive value of @xmath , which is
right-moving in the free-fall frame; these are the @xmath -modes.
Denoting the corresponding @xmath -values by @xmath and @xmath , we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (12.1)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (12.2)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

We want to have integrals similar to those on the left-hand side,
parameterised by @xmath rather than @xmath , without the extra factor in
the integrand:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (12.3)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (12.4)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

We would also like the modes and operators which appear in the integrand
of the right-hand side to obey the usual normalisation and commutation
relations:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (12.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (12.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

with analogous relations for the @xmath -branch. The conditions in Eqs.
( 12.3 )-( 12.6 ) are all satisfied if the modes and operators in the
@xmath -representation are defined as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (12.7)
     @xmath   @xmath      (12.8)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Then, writing explicitly the exponential time dependence of the modes,
the operator @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (12.9)
  -- -------- -- --------

where, substituting Eq. ( 11.3 ) in Eq. ( 12.7 ) and recognising @xmath
as the group velocity @xmath , we have defined

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (12.10)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with an analogous identity for the @xmath -branch.

Although Eq. ( 12.9 ) is correct, it is not yet in its most useful form.
Since @xmath is a conserved quantity, any modes with the same value of
@xmath can be scattered into each other by an inhomogenous flow. What we
have tried to do by writing @xmath as an integral over @xmath rather
than @xmath is split the modes into groups according to their frequency.
Eq. ( 12.9 ) does not quite achieve this, because while we have
separated the modes into the complex conjugate pairs of positive and
negative norm, we have also included negative values of @xmath in the
range of integration. Each value of @xmath , then, actually applies to
two different terms of the integrand; this can be seen in Figure 7 ,
where each value of @xmath clearly corresponds to one positive-norm and
one negative-norm mode. These terms should be grouped together, because
mixing between them is possible. To do this, we note simply that the
integration over @xmath should be over positive values only if the
complex conjugate modes are included explicitly in the integrand.
Therefore, we need to rewrite the second integral as follows:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so that Eq. ( 12.9 ) can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (12.11)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

where we have defined

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (12.12)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Eq. ( 12.12 ) shows that mixing between positive- and negative-norm
modes corresponds to mixing of annihilation and creation operators.
However, it must again be emphasised that, given the present physical
situation of a background flow which is both temporally and spatially
constant, such mixing cannot occur because @xmath and @xmath are
independently conserved. The grouping of @xmath with @xmath in Eq. (
12.12 ) is, at present, merely a mathematical convenience with no
physical significance.

##### 12.2 Subsonic flow

If @xmath so that the slope of the line @xmath is less than @xmath ,
then, as was remarked previously, there are some frequencies with more
than two possible values of @xmath . The analysis performed for
supersonic flow is also applicable here. The transformation of the
@xmath -branch carries over exactly, and the only change that occurs for
the @xmath -branch is that it begins at some @xmath such that @xmath ,
so that the lower limit of the left-hand integral in Eqs. ( 12.2 ) and (
12.4 ) is @xmath rather than zero. Of course, this means that the
operator @xmath in Eq. ( 12.9 ) is not equal to the operator @xmath in
Eq. ( 11.8 ), since we have not yet included those values of @xmath in
the interval from zero to @xmath . This region also splits into two
branches, separated by a value @xmath for which the line @xmath is
tangent to @xmath . The frequency of this mode is the maximum frequency
with more than two solutions, and we denote it by @xmath . This
wavevector therefore has zero group velocity, since @xmath there. Let us
call the region from zero to @xmath the @xmath -branch, and that from
@xmath to @xmath the @xmath -branch; these are illustrated in Figure 8 .
These labels are chosen to indicate that, while all these modes are
right-moving in the free-fall frame and therefore on the @xmath -branch,
those in the interval @xmath are right-moving in the observer’s frame
while those in the interval @xmath are left-moving in the observer’s
frame. The remainder of the analysis proceeds exactly as before, and
relations analogous to those in Eqs. ( 12.7 ) and ( 12.8 ), with an
additional two relations for the @xmath - and @xmath -branches, are
found to implement the transformation to the @xmath -representation. The
contribution to the field from the @xmath - and @xmath -branches is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (12.13)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The complete operator @xmath of Eq. ( 11.8 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (12.14)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -- -- ---------
           (12.15)
  -- -- -- ---------

##### 12.3 Inhomogeneous flow

Let us now allow @xmath to be spatially dependent, although we shall
always assume that @xmath approaches constant limiting values as @xmath
. The Lagrangian of Eq. ( 9.2 ) is no longer invariant under spatial
translations, and @xmath is no longer conserved. However, since @xmath
is time-independent, the Lagrangian is still invariant under time
translations, and frequency remains a conserved quantity. In Figure 9 ,
we represent pictorially the @xmath -dependence of @xmath simply by
varying the slope of the line @xmath in Figs. 7 and 8 , while its @xmath
-intercept, being equal to @xmath , is kept fixed.

Firstly, let us remark that, in the context of an inhomogeneous flow,
the existence of the @xmath - and @xmath -branches in subsonic regions,
coupled with their absence in supersonic regions, is of very special
importance. If the flow varies from subsonic to supersonic, these
wavevectors experience a horizon: we see from Figure 9 that, as the flow
speed increases, the two solutions vary continuously towards each other,
until they merge into a single value; as the flow speed increases
further, there are no real wavevectors corresponding to these branches.
Instead, the wavevector becomes complex, in such a way that the solution
is exponentially decreasing in the supersonic region. The point at which
the wavevectors merge is a group-velocity horizon : the line @xmath is
tangent to @xmath there, so that the group velocity @xmath vanishes.
Since the @xmath - and @xmath -branches have oppositely-directed group
velocities, reflection of a wavepacket from a group-velocity horizon is
possible if its wavevector varies smoothly from one branch to the other.
Numerical simulations of wavepacket propagation - discussed in § 15 -
show that this is indeed what happens. In particular, there is no
shifting to arbitrarily short wavelengths as the horizon is approached,
as in the dispersionless case (compare the out-modes of Fig. 2 @xmath
with those of Fig. 10 @xmath ). Dispersion regularizes the wave
behaviour at the horizon such that wavevectors remain always finite;
that is, there is no trans-Planckian problem.

Since @xmath is no longer a conserved quantity, the @xmath
-representation of @xmath developed above is now the only natural
description of the field. However, in this representation, we still have
to assign a different mode to each value of @xmath , indicated by which
branch ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath or @xmath ) it lies on. There arises
an ambiguity: if @xmath is not conserved, what do these separate modes
mean? If a wavepacket centred at @xmath is scattered by the
inhomogeneous flow into other wavepackets with wavenumbers @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath , on what basis can we still designate this the @xmath
mode? There are two natural ways of assigning labels to the various
modes:

-   Modes may be determined by a single incoming wavenumber, which is
    then scattered into several outgoing wavenumbers; these are known as
    in-modes ;

-   Modes may be determined by a single outgoing wavenumber, which
    results from the scattering of several ingoing wavenumbers; these
    are known as out-modes .

This is the same way in which we categorized the modes in the
dispersionless case (see § 6 ).

Although the modes have a purely exponential time dependence, @xmath ,
and therefore represent stationary solutions, their designation as in-
or out-modes is made more intuitive if we consider them as wavepackets
strongly peaked at the corresponding values of @xmath and @xmath . In
that case, we can visualise the time evolution of the modes by the
scattering of wavepackets, and the in- and out-modes are determined by
whether we have a single incoming wavepacket at early times or a single
outgoing wavepacket at late times. (See Figure 10 for an illustration.)
Wave packets offer an intuitive way of determining whether a particular
wave number is incoming or outgoing, for this is clearly determined by
the direction of the group velocity @xmath , rather than the phase
velocity @xmath . (For an illustration of how the group velocity is
determined, see Figure 14 .)

The wavepacket picture also provides a simple way of seeing that the set
of in-modes and the set of out-modes form complete orthonormal sets of
solutions to the wave equation. Consider, for example, a pair of
in-modes with different values of the initial incoming wavenumber. At
early times, each of these lives entirely in one of the asymptotic
constant velocity regions, and can be considered as wavepackets strongly
peaked around their respective values of @xmath . Their scalar product,
as given in Eq. ( 10.5 ), will nearly vanish, and can be made
arbitrarily close to zero by lengthening the wavepackets or,
equivalently, narrowing their Fourier transforms; this is illustrated in
Figure 11 . Since the scalar product is conserved, this will also be
true at late times, when the modes have scattered into several outgoing
wavepackets. In the limit of infinitely long initial wavepackets,
corresponding to the stationary modes, the scalar product vanishes.
Thus, the in-modes are orthogonal to each other. Moreover, they must be
complete, for they span all possible values of @xmath , which form a
complete set. Therefore, Eqs. ( 12.14 ) and ( 12.15 ) are valid when the
modes are interpreted as in-modes. Exactly the same argument applies to
the out-modes, the only difference being that the scalar product between
different modes is considered at late times, where it is found to vanish
in the same manner as the in-modes. So, we may equally well interpret
the modes as out-modes, which also form a complete orthonormal set.

Henceforward, we shall assume that the asymptotic constant velocity
regions comprise one subsonic and one supersonic region. (This need not
be true, of course. In § 43 , we perform a similar analysis for light in
an optical fibre, analogous to the present case but with both asymptotic
velocities subsonic.) The existence of a group-velocity horizon for
@xmath - and @xmath -modes, discussed above, causes a slight change in
the mode decomposition: since the solution must be exponentially
decreasing in the supersonic region, only one linear combination of the
@xmath - and @xmath -modes is allowed, and they degenerate into a single
mode. This is the mathematical expression of the fact that one of these
modes is ingoing while the other is outgoing, and there is no sense in
which these roles can be swapped. The resulting mode shall be labelled
the @xmath -mode. For @xmath , Eq. ( 12.15 ) becomes

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath                     (12.16)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

In the case, considered previously, of a velocity profile which is
constant in @xmath , it still makes sense to define in- and out-modes by
considering the evolution of wavepackets. However, this case is special
in that the in-mode and out-mode corresponding to a certain wavenumber
are identical: an incoming wavepacket is not scattered, and emerges as a
single outgoing wavepacket with the same value of @xmath . So the modes
and operators in each line of Eq. ( 12.16 ) are identical, and the
superscripts @xmath and @xmath superfluous. Inhomogeneity of @xmath
breaks this degeneracy.

Completeness of each set of modes ensures that we can express one set as
a linear transformation of the other. That is, we can write

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (12.17)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The normalization of the modes, as expressed in Eq. ( 12.5 ), allows the
Bogoliubov coefficients to be written as scalar products between
in-modes and out-modes, e.g. @xmath or @xmath . Using the identity in
Eq. ( 11.2 ), we can then express the out-modes in terms of in-modes,
using the same coefficients of Eqs. ( 12.17 ). The result is:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (12.18)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Substitution of Eqs. ( 12.17 ) in Eq. ( 12.16 ) yields the
transformation for the operators:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (12.19)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Performing the same substitution with Eqs. ( 12.18 ) yields the inverse
transformation:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath               (12.20)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The mixing of creation and annihilation operators is here made explicit:
a single annihilation or creation operator corresponding to an outgoing
particle can be equivalent to a sum of both annihilation and creation
operators for several incoming particles (and vice versa). We have seen
this before, in the dispersionless case (see § 6 ); and, as there, it
leads to inequivalence of the in- and out-vacua.

#### 13 Spontaneous creation of phonons

Making the reasonable assumption that the field is in the in-vacuum,
@xmath - that is, that there are no incoming particles, and the quantum
state is annihilated by all in-mode annihilation operators:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (13.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

- we find that the number expectation value of outgoing particles is
non-zero. For example, in the outgoing @xmath -mode, the number
expectation value is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (13.2)
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where we used the commutator in Eq. ( 12.6 ) and the normalization of
the state @xmath . Similar calculations give the number expectation
values for the other outgoing modes:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
              @xmath   @xmath      (13.3)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (13.4)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Before moving on, let us determine how these values are to be
interpreted; for this we follow an argument made in §IV B of Ref. [ 39 ]
. The appearance of the @xmath functions shows that the results of Eqs.
( 13.2 )-( 13.4 ) are densities rather than numbers. This is because the
orthonormal modes form a continuous spectrum, and are not normalized to
unity but to a delta function, as in Eq. ( 12.5 ). We can overcome this
problem by again turning to wavepackets. If @xmath is constant - as in
the asmyptotic regions where phonons are detected - then the wavepackets

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (13.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

form a complete orthonormal set. This splits the entire space of modes
into wavepackets of reasonably well-defined wavevector (labelled by
@xmath ) and position (labelled by @xmath ). The wavepacket @xmath is
localised at the point where the derivative of the phase in the
integrand vanishes, i.e., at the point

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (13.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

and, at a fixed position @xmath , the time between one wavepacket and
the next - or equivalently, the temporal width of a single wavepacket -
is @xmath . The frequency width of a single wavepacket is related to its
wavevector width - and from the limits of the integral in Eq. ( 13.5 )
we see that @xmath - by the formula @xmath . Thus,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (13.7)
  -- -------- -- --------

The number expectation value @xmath of a single wavepacket at frequency
@xmath contains no @xmath function, and does indeed describe the
particle content of the wavepacket. In a time @xmath , then, the rate of
particles of frequency @xmath is approximately

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (13.8)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the limit @xmath , the first equality of Eq. ( 13.8 ) becomes exact,
and since @xmath becomes infinitesimal, we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (13.9)
  -- -------- -- --------

The wavepackets themselves become plane waves in this limit, and @xmath
is simply the factor multiplying the @xmath functions in Eqs. ( 13.2 )-(
13.4 ). So, upon division by @xmath , these expressions give the
spectral flux density of phonons: the number of phonons emitted per unit
frequency interval per unit time.

Particle creation arises from pairings of oppositely-signed modes - in
this case, the @xmath -mode with the @xmath -mode and the @xmath -mode
with the @xmath -mode. Indeed, as was earlier remarked, conservation of
the norm in the form of Eq. ( 10.6 ) suggests that particles are created
in precisely such pairs, and never singly. We can show this to be true
from the expectation values above: calculating the norms of the modes
@xmath and @xmath in Eqs. ( 12.17 ) and ( 12.18 ), we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and, therefore,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (13.10)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Comparing with Eqs. ( 13.2 )-( 13.4 ), we see that the expectation value
for the @xmath -out mode is equal to the sum of the expectation values
for the @xmath -out and @xmath -out modes, consistent with their being
produced in pairs of oppositely-signed norm.

That spontaneous creation occurs in such pairs can be shown explicity by
writing the in-vacuum @xmath in terms of out-modes, similar to Eq. ( 7.6
). We define the outgoing Fock state @xmath as that state with @xmath
quanta in the state @xmath , and similarly for other modes. The out-mode
creation and annihilation operators act on these states according to the
standard relations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (13.11)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (13.12)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

with analogous relations for the other modes. Then

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (13.13)
  -- -------- -- ---------

for this is the quantum state which is annihilated by all the in-mode
annihilation operators of Eqs. ( 12.20 ). Note that the only states
appearing in the expansion are those with pairs of oppositely-signed
norm - @xmath with @xmath , or @xmath with @xmath . Phonons must be
created only in such pairs.

Eq. ( 13.13 ) is a generalization to a dispersive fluid of the
dispersionless in-vacuum of Eq. ( 7.6 ). One noticeable difference is
that it is now possible for @xmath - and @xmath -modes to couple to each
other, but in practice this is unimportant since the strength of this
coupling is typically very small. In what follows, we shall normally
neglect the Bogoliubov coefficients @xmath and @xmath , so that Eq. (
13.10 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (13.14)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and the creation rates of the @xmath - and @xmath -modes are
approximately equal. Eq. ( 13.13 ) becomes

  -- -- -- ---------
           (13.15)
  -- -- -- ---------

There are two remaining differences with Eq. ( 7.6 ). One is that, while
the two out-modes of the dispersionless case are definitely localized on
opposite sides of the horizon, this is not necessarily true in the
dispersive case. The main part of the @xmath -mode is certainly
localized in this way, but the @xmath -mode is not, for, as seen in Fig.
9 , it behaves perfectly regularly and experiences no group-velocity
horizon. Thus it can happen that, for a black hole horizon, the two
modes are emitted on opposite sides of the horizon, whilst for a white
hole, they are emitted on the same side. The final difference is that,
in the dispersionless case, the coefficients in the expansion ( 13.15 )
are generally unknown, depending on the dispersion profile and the flow
velocity profile. However, their occurrence as Bogoliubov coefficients
in Eqs. ( 12.18 ) provides a way of calculating them numerically; the
methods for this are described in Chapter II , with some results given
in Chapter II .

#### 14 Conclusion and discussion

This chapter has shown how an acoustic field in a dispersive fluid can
be quantized via the usual methods of quantum field theory. The process
is very similar to that for a dispersionless fluid: a complete set of
orthonormal modes is found, into which the field is decomposed; and the
amplitudes of these modes are promoted to creation and annihilation
operators. If the fluid flow is not constant in space, there are two
natural sets of modes: those of a single ingoing wavevector, and those
of a single outgoing wavevector. Either of these sets can be used to
define a vacuum state, whose expectation value for any of the
corresponding “particles” is zero. Under certain conditions - the mixing
of modes with norms of opposite sign - these two vacua are not equal:
the in-vacuum contains outgoing particles, and vice versa.

Dispersion does alter the picture, however. The correspondence between
in- and out-modes is now one of scattering, and the Bogoliubov
coefficients are simply the elements of a scattering matrix, as seen in
Eqs. ( 12.17 ) or Eqs. ( 12.18 ). In this sense, the origin of mixing of
positive- and negative-norm modes is simpler to understand than in the
dispersionless case. There is no need to rely on there having been a
formation, sometime in the past, of an event horizon; whereas, in the
dispersionless case, the assumption of a past with no horizon allows us
to determine how the in-modes should be defined. This poses a problem
for an eternal horizon; but in the presence of dispersion, there is no
such problem. This is closely related to the trans-Planckian problem,
which is also swept away by dispersion. Tracing any outgoing wavepacket
back into the past, we no longer find it having arisen from arbitrarily
short wavelengths; rather, it scatters into several well-defined - and
certainly finite - ingoing wavevectors.

Of course, there are drawbacks. Although the Bogoliubov coefficients
have an intuitive interpretation as scattering amplitudes, they are not
so easy to calculate, and in general must be found numerically. In
Chapter II we shall attempt an analytic treatment by linearizing the
velocity profile; but, as remarked in § 8 , since the wavepackets cannot
now be traced back in time arbitrarily close to the horizon, this
linearized profile can only give an approximate amplitude at best.

But perhaps the most surprising consequence of dispersion is that there
is no need to talk of an event horizon in the derivation of spontaneous
creation. Beginning with Eq. ( 12.16 ), we did assume the existence of
one; but this only has the effect of reducing the dimensionality of the
modes because of the degeneracy of the @xmath - and @xmath -modes, as
discussed previously. We could have assumed that both asymptotic regions
are subsonic, so that Eq. ( 12.15 ) continues to be valid, and it would
have made no significant difference to the conclusions. Only the
scattering between positive- and negative-norm modes is required for
spontaneous creation to be possible. It may be that the existence of an
event horizon has a significant effect on the calculated rate; we have
yet to examine this. But even the smallest of velocity changes, which
comes nowhere near to establishing an event horizon, can, in principle,
induce particle creation.

### Chapter \thechapter Methods of Acoustic Model

Having derived the existence of Hawking radiation and a formula for the
radiation rate, we come now to the problem of how to calculate this
rate. Comparing Eqs. ( 12.18 ) with Eqs. ( 13.2 )-( 13.4 ), we see that
finding the rate is equivalent to finding the coefficients of scattering
into negative-norm modes. Neglecting the coupling into @xmath -modes so
that Eqs. ( 13.14 ) and ( 13.15 ) are valid, and assuming that @xmath
varies between a subsonic and a supersonic region so that the merging of
the @xmath - and @xmath -modes into a single @xmath -mode occurs, the
only coefficient of interest is that for scattering between the @xmath -
and @xmath -modes: @xmath . (We also use the standard notation for the
elastic scattering, @xmath .) We may examine one of several different
modes to find this coefficient.

In this chapter, we shall examine two numerical methods for finding
@xmath : in § 15 , an FDTD (Finite Difference Time Domain) algorithm,
which solves for wavepacket propagation; and in § 16 , an ordinary
differential equation solver, for calculating steady-state solutions.
Steady-state solutions can be found algebraically for velocity profiles
constant everywhere except for step discontinuities, and this is also
examined. Finally, in § 17 , we examine the linearized velocity profile,
in imitation of § 5 for the dispersionless case, to try to find an
approximate analytic expression for @xmath .

#### 15 Wavepacket propagation

Here, we present an FDTD algorithm (due to Unruh [ 18 ] ) that solves
directly for the propagation of a wavepacket. This is not so useful for
calculating @xmath : since a wavepacket is a linear superposition of
solutions, the negative-norm contribution is likewise such a
superposition and will not be exactly equal to @xmath . Furthermore,
@xmath is a spectral density, required to be integrated over a broad
frequency range, and the FDTD algorithm is too time-consuming to be
practical for repetition over a range of frequencies. However, it is
useful in visualising the solutions as scattering processes, as
illustrated in Figure 10 ; it shows clearly that the @xmath - and @xmath
-branches are shifted into each other by a group-velocity horizon, and
that the wavepacket does not simply come to a standstill.

We begin by expressing the second-order wave equation ( 9.4 ) as two
coupled first-order equations. This can be done using the canonical
momentum, @xmath , as defined in Eq. ( 2.7 ). We have:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (15.1)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (15.2)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Recall (see Eq. ( 9.6 )) that the action of the operator @xmath on
@xmath can be expressed more explicitly using the Fourier transform
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (15.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

The action of @xmath may be calculated by repeated application of a Fast
Fourier Transform algorithm. (See, for example, Ref. [ 58 ] for a
description.)

We now imagine a spatial grid, with separation @xmath between
neighbouring points, on which we specify the values of @xmath and keep
track of the values of @xmath and @xmath . Since @xmath is now replaced
by a discrete variable, which we label @xmath , the continuous function
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath are replaced by their discretized versions
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath . The @xmath -derivative at a point is
approximated by the formula

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (15.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

A time grid is also introduced, with separation @xmath between
neighbouring times. However, it is convenient to let the times on which
we specify @xmath and those on which we specify @xmath to be offset by
@xmath . Replacing @xmath by the discrete variable @xmath , the
continuous functions @xmath and @xmath are replaced by their discretized
versions @xmath and @xmath . Since we have to relate values of one to
derivatives of the other, we form time derivatives using the formula

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (15.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

while spatial derivatives are taken to be the average of the spatial
derivatives at times @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (15.6)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Applying Eqs. ( 15.5 ) and ( 15.6 ) to Eqs. ( 15.1 ) and ( 15.2 ), we
find the finite-difference equations

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

which can be written in the more suggestive form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (15.7)
                                @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (15.8)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Equations ( 15.7 ) and ( 15.8 ) are almost closed, except at the
boundaries, where the values of @xmath or @xmath at @xmath or @xmath
depends on their values at @xmath or @xmath . The latter are not
included in the grid, but this problem can be overcome by imposing
periodic boundary conditions; that is, we identify @xmath with @xmath
and @xmath with @xmath .

There remains the problem of specifying the initial profile for the
momentum @xmath , once the initial form of @xmath has been specified. In
principle, there are no limitations on @xmath , for there are two
possible dispersion branches and a general solution of the wave equation
can contain an arbitrary mixture of the two. However, we wish to have a
wavepacket centred at well-defined values of @xmath and @xmath ; this
selects a single dispersion branch, and the momentum is uniquely
specified. Given that we use wavepackets which are right-moving in the
free-fall frame, and which are initially in a region of constant flow
velocity, we have @xmath and the momentum is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (15.9)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus, the momentum at time @xmath - which shall be labelled @xmath ,
since it comes half a timestep before @xmath - is easily calculated
using the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. @xmath is then found by
propagating forward @xmath using the modified difference equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (15.10)
  -- -------- -- ---------

With these conditions, Eqs. ( 15.7 ) and ( 15.8 ) form a closed linear
system for each value of @xmath : given @xmath and @xmath , we can use
Eq. ( 15.7 ) to find @xmath , and this in turn allows us to use Eq. (
15.8 ) to find @xmath . At each stage, the right-hand side is known. The
term @xmath is found via Eq. ( 15.3 ), using a Fast Fourier Transform
algorithm first to find @xmath , and then again to take the inverse
Fourier transform after multiplying by @xmath . The knowns of the
right-hand side form an @xmath -dimensional vector; the left-hand side
contains @xmath unknowns in total. The whole linear system can be
written in matrix form as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where we have defined

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (15.11)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (15.12)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (15.13)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The linear systems above are known as cyclic equations, given their
periodic nature, and are easily solved using an appropriate algorithm.
(See Ref. [ 58 ] , §2.4.)

Calculation of the norm of the solution before and after the propagation
provides a check on the accuracy of the numerical procedure. Recall (see
Eqs. ( 2.6 ) and ( 10.6 )) that the norm is given by Eq. ( 10.1 ) or, in
regions where @xmath is constant, by Eq. ( 10.6 ). The negative-norm
contribution, equivalent to the radiation rate, is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (15.14)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the Fourier transform of the negative-norm branch.
Therefore, if we begin with a positive-norm @xmath -mode wavepacket and
allow it to scatter completely into outgoing wavepackets, @xmath is
found by integrating Eq. ( 15.14 ) over the @xmath -mode part of the
resulting Fourier transform.

See Figure 12 for an example which shows frequency shifting between the
@xmath - and @xmath -modes.

#### 16 Steady-state solution

The creation rate @xmath is exact only for a stationary solution, the
wavepackets of § 15 being superpositions of stationary solutions peaked
at a certain value of @xmath . Solving for the stationary solutions
directly is also faster than performing the FDTD algorithm of § 15 ,
which makes it the more practical method for calculating a spectrum
which extends over many frequencies. Here, we determine how to find the
stationary solutions. We begin with a general velocity profile, which
must be solved by numerical integration and linear algebra; such a
method is also described and used in Refs. [ 39 , 40 , 44 ] . We then
examine the special case of a velocity profile that is constant except
for step discontinuities, which is solvable by linear algebra only; see
also Refs. [ 40 , 42 ] .

##### 16.1 General velocity profile

The time-independent acoustic wave equation is the ordinary differential
equation satisfied by @xmath , where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (16.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is a stationary solution, whose time-dependence is purely
oscillatory. Plugging it into Eq. ( 9.4 ), we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (16.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

If @xmath is constant for all @xmath , we may take the Fourier transform
of this equation to obtain Eq. ( 9.7 ), with @xmath now interpreted as a
fixed parameter. The general solution is simply a linear combination of
plane waves,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (16.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the index @xmath enumerates all possible solutions of the
dispersion relation ( 9.8 ), and the @xmath are complex constants. Note
that some of the @xmath might be complex (and if so, they will occur in
complex conjugate pairs, since the dispersion relation is real);
however, given that they will increase exponentially in one direction,
these do not represent physical solutions and can be discarded. Also
note that there may be infinitely many such plane waves, so that Eq. (
16.3 ) is an infinite series; we shall, however, assume @xmath to be a
finite polynomial, so that @xmath has a maximum value.

Now let @xmath be spatially varying, yet still asymptotically constant:
@xmath as @xmath . Then, in the asymptotic regions, @xmath can still be
represented by the sum in Eq. ( 16.3 ). In general, the sums that
correspond to the negative and positive asymptotic regions will not
agree, even if @xmath . This allows the appearance of complex values of
@xmath which are exponentially decreasing towards infinity, for such a
value of @xmath need not (indeed, will not, for physical solutions)
appear in the opposite asymptotic region.

The sums in the asymptotic regions are not arbitrary, but related to
each other via Eq. ( 16.2 ). Suppose we specify that, in the negative
asymptotic region, @xmath should be given by the plane wave @xmath .
This is a boundary condition, and in a differential equation solver -
such as the Mathematica function NDSolve, used for this thesis - we can
set @xmath and the necessary number of derivatives of @xmath equal to
those of @xmath in the negative asymptotic region, and solve Eq. ( 16.2
) through to the positive asymptotic region; this is illustrated in
Figure 13 . Here, @xmath is again expressible as a sum of exponentials:
@xmath . This solution is wholly determined by the constants @xmath ,
which form a vector: @xmath . The same integration can be performed for
all other @xmath in the negative asymptotic region, whose solutions in
the positive asymptotic region are wholly determined by vectors @xmath .
Moreover, since Eq. ( 16.2 ) is linear in @xmath , a linear
superposition of solutions is itself a solution. Thus, if we form a
solution in the negative asymptotic region of the form @xmath - which
can be represented as the vector @xmath - the solution in the positive
asymptotic region, @xmath , will be represented by the vector @xmath .
It is clear that the vectors which specify the solutions in each of the
asymptotic regions are related via a linear transformation, which can be
written in matrix form:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (16.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

The importance of Eq. ( 16.4 ) is that it makes clear that there are
only @xmath values which need be specified to pick out a particular
solution of @xmath ; and, moreover, one of these is simply an overall
multiplicative constant, which is unimportant. The @xmath values
remaining need not refer to coefficients in a single asymptotic region.
Indeed, when we solve for in- and out-modes, it will be found that some
of the coefficients on either side must be set to zero, depending on
whether they are ingoing or outgoing. The remaining coefficients are
found by solving Eq. ( 16.4 ), with one of them set to an arbitrary
constant which determines the overall multiplicative factor; in
practice, we usually set the coefficient of the single ingoing or
outgoing wave to unity.

If solving for an in- or out-mode, the @xmath and @xmath which should be
set to zero are determined by the direction of propagation of the
corresponding wavevectors. For example, if we are solving for an in-mode
as in Fig. 10 @xmath , then only the initial wavevector can propagate
towards the horizon, whilst any wavevectors propagating away from the
horizon are allowed; any ingoing wavevectors other than the initial one
must have a coefficient of zero. Whether a wave is ingoing or outgoing
depends on the sign of the group velocity,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (16.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore, if the slope of @xmath is greater than the slope of @xmath ,
the group velocity is positive and a wavepacket centred at the
corresponding value of @xmath travels to the right; whereas, if the
slope of @xmath is less than the slope of @xmath , the group velocity is
negative and such a wavepacket travels to the left. In Fig. 14 , @xmath
, @xmath and @xmath have negative group velocities and travel to the
left, while @xmath has a positive group velocity and travels to the
right. Therefore, for a given value of @xmath , we can easily determine
the possible real values of @xmath and the direction of travel of their
wavepackets.

The Bogoliubov coefficients describe transformations between normalized
solutions, which are given by Eq. ( 12.10 ). Having calculated the
coefficient @xmath of the plane wave @xmath , the norm of this wave -
relative to the norm of the incoming or outgoing wave - is given by [ 40
]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (16.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation allows us to determine the accuracy of the solution by
checking that the norm is conserved, i.e., that the sum of the norms of
all incoming waves is equal to the sum of the norms of all outgoing
waves. We can also find the creation rate @xmath , which is simply the
relative norm between wavevectors of oppositely-signed norm.

##### 16.2 Discontinuous velocity profile

Given the complexity of Eq. ( 16.2 ), purely analytic solutions are
often impossible to obtain. An exception to this, however, occurs when
@xmath is constant everywhere except at discrete points, where any
changes are marked by a sudden discontinuity. Such discontinuous
velocity profiles form limiting cases, where the derivative of @xmath
has been allowed to increase without bound. Similar step-discontinuous
profiles have been examined in References [ 39 ] and [ 42 ] .

We have already observed that, in regions where the flow velocity is
constant, @xmath is simply a linear combination of plane waves. Suppose
that @xmath is of order @xmath , giving @xmath solutions to the
dispersion relation; then, in any such constant-velocity region, the
general solution is characterised by the @xmath coefficients
corresponding to the different possible plane waves. Suppose also that
the velocity profile @xmath has @xmath constant velocity regions (and
therefore @xmath points of discontinuity). Then there are @xmath
coefficients in total, and all must be specified to completely
characterise the solution. Of course, we still have only @xmath in- or
out-modes, so the @xmath coefficients are not all independent: they are
restricted by @xmath conditions to be imposed at the points of
discontinuity, or @xmath conditions at each such point. These conditions
relate the function @xmath and its first @xmath derivatives on either
side of the point of discontinuity, and are derived such that, as the
velocity profile is gradually altered towards the formation of the
discontinuity, Eq. ( 16.2 ) is always satisfied.

Firstly, note that Eq. ( 16.2 ) contains @xmath and its first derivative
@xmath only. A step discontinuity in @xmath results in @xmath being
infinite (i.e. proportional to the delta function) at the point of
discontinuity. These must be compensated for by corresponding
discontinuities and delta functions appearing in the derivatives of
@xmath . We can immediately conclude that, since the highest derivative
of @xmath appearing in Eq. ( 16.2 ) is of order @xmath , @xmath and its
first @xmath derivatives are continuous everywhere; for, if this were
not the case, @xmath would contain derivatives of the delta function,
which would not be compensated for by similar infinities in another
quantity. Therefore, at any point of discontinuity, the first @xmath
conditions imposed are that @xmath @xmath , @xmath , @xmath be
continuous, their values on either side of the point being equal. This
leaves one condition remaining, which relates @xmath on either side of
the point. There must be a discontinuity in @xmath in order to generate
a delta function in @xmath to cancel that in @xmath ; but what is this
discontinuity?

Let us proceed along lines suggested by Figure 15 . We consider a
velocity profile which varies between two velocities, which are constant
in their respective regions. The variation between them is assumed to be
linear. We therefore have a discontinuity not in @xmath , but @xmath ,
which is zero for @xmath and @xmath , and equal to @xmath for @xmath .
Our task is to calculate the change in @xmath between @xmath and @xmath
, and then to take the limit as @xmath .

With the velocity profile of Fig. 15 (a), in order that Eq. ( 16.2 ) be
satisfied on either side of the point @xmath there must be a
corresponding discontinuity in another quantity to cancel that from
@xmath . For reasons similar to those given above, only the
highest-order derivative of @xmath that appears in Eq. ( 16.2 ) can be
discontinuous; for, if a lower-order derivative were discontinuous, all
higher-order derivatives would be infinite at @xmath , and these
infinities would not be cancelled. So, the discontinuity in @xmath is
compensated for by a corresponding discontinuity in @xmath . Writing
@xmath explicity as a finite polynomial,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (16.7)
  -- -------- -- --------

Eq. ( 16.2 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (16.8)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the limit as we approach the point of discontinuity - which we label
@xmath - we must have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (16.9)
  -- -------- -- --------

Therefore, defining @xmath , and similarly for @xmath , we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (16.10)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

where it is understood that @xmath and @xmath are evaluated at @xmath
(since they are continuous, there is no ambiguity). Although this step
discontinuity in @xmath will cause @xmath to become infinite (i.e.
proportional to the delta function) precisely at the point of
discontinuity, there may also be a discontinuity in the limiting values
of @xmath . This can be found exactly as above, but to find the
differential equation containing @xmath , we must differentiate Eq. (
16.8 ). The result is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (16.11)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We have already argued that all derivatives up to and including @xmath
must be continuous at @xmath ; therefore, the only possible
discontinuous derivative appearing in Eq. ( 16.11 ) is @xmath .
Moreover, note that @xmath , though infinite precisely at @xmath (as is
@xmath ), is zero on either side of this point. The discontinuity in
@xmath must be balanced by a corresponding discontinuity (or, rather, a
difference in limiting values) in @xmath ; indeed, we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (16.12)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which implies

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (16.13)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

where, again, @xmath and @xmath are understood to be evaluated at @xmath
.

Note that higher derivatives of @xmath will also have discontinuities,
which can be found by differentiating Eq. ( 16.11 ) further. In the
resulting differential equations, however, this will never yield a
higher power of @xmath than @xmath . Therefore, the discontinuities in
higher derivatives can, at most, vary as @xmath .

The change in @xmath over the region of change in @xmath can be found
using a Taylor expansion:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Letting @xmath , we find that the first three terms of the second line
vanish, since they are unaffected by the discontinuity. Moreover, since
the discontinuities can have at most a @xmath dependence, only the terms
in @xmath and @xmath can yield terms that are independent of @xmath .
Consequently, we find that there is a discontinuity in @xmath which is
given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (16.14)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

Eq. ( 16.14 ) is the final condition to be imposed at each point of
discontinuity. (To the author’s knowledge, this general expression for
the discontinuity in @xmath has not been presented previously in the
literature.) Having begun with @xmath coefficients, we have seen that
the differential equation imposes @xmath linear conditions on them,
which leaves only @xmath degrees of freedom: precisely the number
required to uniquely specify a solution of the @xmath -order
differential equation ( 16.2 ).

#### 17 Linearized velocity profile

In our quest to find @xmath , the amount of mode conversion into
negative-frequency modes, we would like to have even an approximate
analytic formula for the process. This allows us to see which parameters
are important, and the derivation of such a formula can offer insight
into the fundamental nature of the process.

Let us continue to deal with stationary solutions of the form ( 16.1 ),
and which satisfy the differential equation ( 16.2 ). Dispersion adds
higher derivatives to this equation through the operator @xmath , making
it difficult to solve in position space and generally requiring
numerical integration to do so, as in § 16 . However, in Fourier space,
the operator simply becomes a multiplicative function @xmath , and does
not determine the order of the differential equation. Instead, the
velocity profile @xmath is replaced by the operator @xmath , so it is
@xmath which determines the order of the differential equation.
Generally, the resulting equation is also very complicated; but, if we
make the simplifying assumption that the origins of mode conversion are
mainly in the vicinity of the horizon, we may approximate @xmath by its
linearized form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (17.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

(having taken the zero of @xmath to be at the horizon, and assuming that
@xmath is non-zero there). This is illustrated pictorially in Figure 16
. The mathematical result is the reduction of Eq. ( 16.2 ) to a
second-order differential equation, making it much more tractable. (Such
a transformation is also performed in Refs. [ 41 ] and [ 48 ] .)

##### 17.1 Solution in Fourier space

Performing the transformation just described - that is, replacing @xmath
with the approximation in Eq. ( 17.1 ), then transforming to the Fourier
representation via the substitutions @xmath , @xmath and @xmath - the
differential equation ( 16.2 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (17.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

This can be reduced to a standard form second-order differential
equation by defining another field @xmath such that

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (17.3)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

for Eq. ( 17.2 ) then becomes the remarkably simple equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (17.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is identical in form to the time-independent Schrödinger equation.
By direct analogy, we can apply the WKB method [ 59 ] (see also [ 38 ,
41 , 48 ] for applications to Hawking radiation) to find the approximate
solution

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (17.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are arbitrary constants. (The meaning of the
labels shall soon become clear.) Eq. ( 17.5 ) is valid so long as the
“de Broglie wavelength”, @xmath , varies negligibly over a single cycle;
more precisely [ 59 ] ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (17.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

The full Fourier transform @xmath is found via substitution in Eq. (
17.3 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (17.7)
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

##### 17.2 Transforming back to position space

@xmath is, of course, the inverse Fourier transform of @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (17.8)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where we have defined

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

We can find an approximate solution to Eq. ( 17.8 ) using the
saddle-point approximation. This states that the main contribution to
the integral in this equation comes from those points where the first
derivatives of the phases @xmath and @xmath vanish. Then, to lowest
order, the contribution from each of these points behaves like an
overall constant multiplied by a Gaussian integral, so long as the
integration contour may be taken along the direction of steepest
descent. Given that the phases are integrals themselves, the saddle
points are those where the integrands vanish, i.e.,

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Recall that, since we have linearized the velocity around the horizon,
@xmath is simply the flow velocity @xmath . Therefore, we can rewrite
the above conditions in the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (17.9)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (17.10)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

At any position @xmath , the saddle points of the phases in Eq. ( 17.8 )
are simply those values of @xmath that solve the dispersion relation
with the local value of the flow velocity. The phase @xmath has saddle
points at those solutions which are right-moving with respect to the
fluid, and therefore lie on the @xmath -branch; the saddle points of the
phase @xmath are solutions that are left-moving with respect to the
fluid, and lie on the @xmath -branch. For the sake of simplicity, we
shall continue to assume that there is negligible coupling between the
@xmath - and @xmath -branches, dealing exclusively with the @xmath
-branch; that is, we set @xmath .

In order to perform the integration by approximation with Gaussian
integrals, we also need the second derivative of the phase at its saddle
points:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (17.11)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

where, in the second equality, we have evaluated @xmath at the saddle
points using Eq. ( 17.9 ). Therefore, in the vicinity of a solution
@xmath of Eq. ( 17.9 ), the phase @xmath is approximately given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath                     (17.12)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

where from Eq. ( 17.9 ) we have identified @xmath , the local group
velocity. (Note that, as a solution of Eq. ( 17.9 ), @xmath is itself
@xmath -dependent.)

We may now perform the integral in Eq. ( 17.8 ). Firstly, note that the
integral is properly Gaussian if @xmath increases in the @xmath
direction; therefore, the direction of steepest descent is proportional
to @xmath . Assuming that the integration contour may be deformed so as
to pass through each saddle point in its direction of steepest descent,
the position-space solution becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (17.13)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Notice that the factors of @xmath are exactly those required to
normalize the various plane waves in the @xmath -representation
according to Eq. ( 12.10 ). Therefore, the relative norms of the modes
themselves are entirely determined by the phases @xmath .

##### 17.3 Generalization to nonlinear velocity profiles

Within the limits of the saddle-point approximation, Eq. ( 17.13 ) is
strictly valid only in the case of the linear velocity profile ( 17.1 ).
However, this fact has been made implicit by writing the solution in its
present form, and it is easy to extrapolate the solution to nonlinear
velocity profiles. To see this, note that the prefactor is unimportant,
and its dependence on @xmath can be removed simply by making @xmath
proportional to @xmath . @xmath appears in the sign of the @xmath part
of the phase; however, it is only the sign of @xmath that matters here,
and so long as @xmath is monotonic in @xmath , this sign is uniquely
determined. We thus restrict our attention to monotonic velocity
profiles. Now the only part of Eq. ( 17.13 ) still dependent on the
linear form of Eq. ( 17.1 ) is the phase @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (17.14)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

where the function @xmath is defined according to Eq. ( 17.9 ) with the
linearized velocity profile ( 17.1 ) substituted for @xmath . @xmath ,
then, is the position @xmath at which the wavevector @xmath is a
solution of (the @xmath -branch of) the dispersion relation. Although
this has been derived for the special case of a linear velocity profile,
it is easily extendable to any monotonic velocity profile. When
expressed in this general form, we also note that @xmath , the
derivative of @xmath at the horizon, no longer has a privileged status.
We may not interpret Eq. ( 17.13 ) as being applicable to any monotonic
velocity profile, and we may write

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (17.15)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Note that, while Eq. ( 17.15 ) is not an original result, its
application to the entire velocity profile - not just the linearized
form - is a novel approach, and leads to original results.

Not only are the velocity profiles we are interested in monotonic, but
they also approach asymptotic limiting values as @xmath . Thus, at those
values of @xmath which solve the dispersion relation in the asymptotic
regions, @xmath rapidly diverges. The @xmath -dependence of the phase is
not obvious in the form of Eq. ( 17.14 ); however, differentiating with
respect to @xmath , and recalling that @xmath is itself a function of
@xmath , we find @xmath , and so

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (17.16)
  -- -------- -- ---------

up to an unimportant additive constant. (This is simply the formula for
integration by parts.) The right side of Eq. ( 17.16 ) is the more usual
form of the phase generated by the WKB approximaton in position space,
and it clearly shows that the individual components become plane waves
in the asymptotic regions.

The first equality of Eq. ( 17.16 ) is the most useful for relating
different wavevectors (as opposed to different positions ) to each
other. Their relative phase is simply the integral of @xmath between
them; their relative norm, or squared amplitude, is determined by the
imaginary part of this integral. Since @xmath is always real, it is the
imaginary part of the function @xmath which is important. Thus the norm
of one wavevector @xmath relative to that of another wavevector @xmath
is given by

  -- -- -------- -- ---------
        @xmath      (17.17)
  -- -- -------- -- ---------

In particular, for particle creation, the relative weight between the
Bogoliubov coefficients is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (17.18)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Eqs. ( 17.17 ) and ( 17.18 ) are new results, derived simply from the
extension of the applicability of Eq. ( 17.15 ) to the entire velocity
profile. Thus the validity of the former depends on the validity of the
latter. Certainly, they cannot be applied when the WKB approximation
breaks down and the condition ( 17.6 ) is not satisfied - that is, in
the non-adiabatic limit of large @xmath . The question of when Eqs. (
17.17 ) and ( 17.18 ) are applicable is rather more difficult to
address, for, strictly speaking, Eq. ( 17.15 ) is in valid for any
nonlinear velocity profile! Since the limits of the integrals in Eqs. (
17.17 ) and ( 17.18 ) correspond to asymptotic regions where @xmath
approaches constant values, they implicity imply that @xmath is
nonlinear, and we cannot expect a priori that are valid in any regime.
That they do possess a regime of validity will be shown in the following
chapter by comparison with numerical results, but the reason for the
existence of this regime remains a mystery.

It is important to note that, apart from the considerations just
discussed, Eqs. ( 17.17 ) and ( 17.18 ) are valid only for a wave
solution which can be expressed in terms of a single contour integral of
the form in Eq. ( 17.8 ). In general, owing to the multivaluedness of
the imaginary part of @xmath , there are several possible such
integrals, with different results. This is to be expected: there are
generally several solutions to the dispersion relation, each one giving
rise to an independent solution of the wave equation. It is also
generally true that, as described in § 16 , a particular in- or out-mode
is formed via linear combination of these solutions. In this case, the
relative norm of a particular wavevector will be given by some linear
combination of its various norms of the form ( 17.17 ).

#### 18 Summary

This chapter has demonstrated three ways of determining the amount of
mode conversion induced by a given velocity profile:

-   an FDTD algorithm to solve for the evolution of a wavepacket
    directly;

-   numerical integration of an ordinary differential equation to find
    the steady-state solution for a given Killing frequency; this is
    done both generally and for the case of a profile with step
    discontinuities; and

-   an analytic treatment involving linearizing the velocity profile
    around the horizon and extrapolating the result to more general
    profiles.

### Chapter \thechapter Results for Acoustic Model

In chapters I and II , we demonstrated, from a purely theoretical
standpoint, that mode conversion between positive- and negative-norm
modes in both nondispersive and dispersive fluids leads to spontaneous
creation of phonons. Chapter II turned to the practicalities of
calculating the amount of mode conversion, and consequently the phonon
creation rate. The descriptions and derivations of these chapters have
been kept as general as possible, so as to be applicable to many
different velocity and dispersion profiles.

In the present chapter, we turn our attention to specific examples, so
as to provide a quantitative account of the Hawking phonon radiation
expected in fluids. The velocity and dispersion profiles used are kept
as simple as possible, and we expect many of the qualitative features of
the results still to be applicable in the general case.

#### 19 Dispersion profile

Firstly, let us define the dispersion relation to be used. Recall that
the dispersionless case (see Eqs. ( 3.4 ) and ( 9.8 )) has @xmath ; and
that, since the fluid is isotropic in its rest frame, @xmath should
contain only even powers of @xmath . Since the complexities of
dispersion arise through the introduction of higher-order derivatives in
the wave equation, the simplest deviation from the dispersionless model
is through the inclusion of a quartic term in @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (19.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is usually found that @xmath approaches a dispersionless form for low
values of @xmath , and this feature has been incorporated in Eq. ( 19.1
); @xmath , then, is the limiting wave velocity (both phase and group
velocity) for small wavevectors. These are quantitatively defined as
being much smaller than the parameter @xmath , i.e., there is no or
little dispersion for wavevectors @xmath such that @xmath . The
parameter @xmath , then, determines the point at which significant
deviations from nondispersive behaviour first appear, and can be said to
signify the strength of the dispersion: the larger is @xmath , the
larger is the value of @xmath at which dispersive effects begin to take
hold, and so the weaker is the dispersion. Finally, the minus attached
to the deviation @xmath corresponds to subluminal dispersion (phase
velocity becoming less than @xmath ); had this been a plus sign, it
would describe superluminal dispersion (phase velocity becoming greater
than @xmath ). We have restricted ourselves to subluminal dispersion,
since superluminal dispersion gives results which are qualitatively very
similar, the main difference occurring in the coupling to @xmath -modes
[ 44 ] which is neglected here. Both Eq. ( 19.1 ) and its superluminal
counterpart are plotted in Figure 17 .

#### 20 Velocity profile

Endeavouring to keep the physical system as simple as possible, we shall
use a velocity profile that varies monotonically between two asymptotic
values; such a profile shall then be invertible, which is useful for
application of the analytic results in Eqs. ( 17.15 ) and ( 17.17 ). The
simplest candidate is the hyperbolic tangent function, and accordingly
we restrict ourselves to velocity profiles of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (20.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath and @xmath are the asymptotic values of @xmath as @xmath tends to
@xmath or @xmath , respectively. The parameter @xmath characterizes the
steepness of the velocity profile, but this also depends on the
difference @xmath ; a more direct interpretation of @xmath is that it
governs the length of the region of transition between @xmath and @xmath
, which is of order @xmath as shown in Figure 18 .

It may be argued that a velocity profile with equal asymptotic
velocities would be a more desirable option. Certainly, such a profile
would have greater practical applicability: the change in flow velocity
is normally caused by a local disturbance, such as an obstacle that
alters the depth of fluid and hence the speed of its flow, or an intense
pulse of light that alters the refractive index of an optical fibre. In
these practical scenarios, the change is local, and the physical
conditions in a region far from the change are the same whether we are
ahead of the change or behind it. But the corresponding velocity profile
is not invertible, so that the analytic treatment of § 17 is
inapplicable; and a horizon, should one occur, must be accompanied by a
partner horizon on the other side of the change. Since the derivatives
of the flow velocity at these horizons must have opposite signs, one of
them will be a black hole horizon, the other a white hole horizon. The
Hawking spectrum emitted by such a system will be some superposition of
the spectra of each horizon, and might exhibit interference. Given these
complications, it is wise to limit ourselves to the investigation of a
single horizon, or at least a monotonic variation, for which we must pay
the reasonable price of physical equivalence of the asymptotic regions.

#### 21 Normalizing the wave equation

With the dispersion and velocity profiles given by Eqs. ( 19.1 ) and (
20.1 ), the acoustic wave equation ( 9.4 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (21.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation contains five parameters: @xmath and @xmath from the
dispersion profile; and @xmath , @xmath and @xmath from the velocity
profile. However, two of these correspond to the scaling of space and
time; in normalizing the variables to make them dimensionless, we can
reduce the number of independent parameters to three.

Firstly, let us normalize the velocity profile with respect to @xmath ,
the low- @xmath limit of the wave velocity. We define the dimensionless
velocity @xmath , and rewrite the wave equation in the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Next, let us normalize the position variable @xmath (and, consequently,
the wavenumber @xmath ) by requiring that the dispersion parameter
@xmath be normalized to unity. This is done by defining the
dimensionless position variable @xmath ; then the partial derivative
@xmath , and the dimensionless wavenumber @xmath . With this
substitution, the wave equation becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (21.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

and @xmath . Finally, we shall normalize the time variable @xmath (and
the frequency @xmath ). The present form of the wave equation shows that
the tidiest way to do this is to define the dimensionless time variable
@xmath ; consequently, the partial derivative @xmath , the dimensionless
frequency @xmath is given by the relation @xmath , and the wave equation
takes the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (21.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

This can be factorized to give

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (21.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the rescaled dispersion relation is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (21.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

The wave equation now contains only three parameters:

-   @xmath and @xmath , the asymptotic values of the flow velocity
    relative to the low-frequency wave speed; and

-   @xmath , a parameter that combines steepness of the flow velocity
    profile with dispersion strength. A higher value of @xmath indicates
    greater steepness / stronger dispersion.

Often, the central value of the velocity is taken to be @xmath , so that
this point would be the event horizon in the dispersionless case. Then,
@xmath is fixed (at @xmath ), and the number of parameters is reduced to
two: one is still @xmath ; the other is taken to be @xmath , the
“height” of the velocity profile, where @xmath and @xmath . We shall
examine this case; but we will also go on to examine more general
velocity profiles where @xmath is not the central value, including those
where @xmath is nowhere equal to @xmath . Although, in the latter case,
there is no horizon for low wavevectors, the discussion in § 14 suggests
that spontaneous phonon creation is still a possibility.

#### 22 Thermal behaviour

Purely thermal behaviour, as in Eq. ( 7.2 ), is characterized by the
Planck spectrum

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (22.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

Clearly, @xmath as @xmath , and the low-frequency temperature of any
spectrum which behaves in a similar way can be defined accordingly; that
is, we say that the spectrum has low-frequency temperature @xmath if

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (22.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

In order to regularize the spectrum, it is useful to define a new
quantity [ 44 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (22.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is some predicted value for the temperature. Since @xmath
is a number spectrum, @xmath is proportional to the energy spectrum. Its
behaviour as @xmath is very instructive, for if @xmath has a
low-frequency temperature @xmath in the sense defined above, we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (22.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath , then, measures the low-frequency temperature relative to @xmath
; and in the special case when @xmath , the spectral form of @xmath
provides a reference thermal curve (shown in Figure 19 ) against which
other spectra may be compared.

Thermal effects, then, are dominant at low frequencies. Generally, the
Hawking spectra are not purely thermal (see § 23 for further
discussion). However, when there is a point at which @xmath , there is
an event horizon for all wavevectors in the limit @xmath , since the
dispersion profile approaches the dispersionless limit in this regime.
We might reasonably expect that low-frequency thermal behaviour is
preserved when @xmath at some point; the numerical results of § 25 show
that this is the case. To determine the value of the low-frequency
temperature, we must look at two separate regimes.

##### 22.1 Validity of linearized velocity profile

If the linearized velocity profile of Eq. ( 17.1 ) is valid over some
length scale, we expect the phase integral form of the creation rate in
Eq. ( 17.17 ) to hold; and, moreover, it should agree with Eq. ( 7.3 )
for the temperature in the dispersionless case,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (22.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

With the velocity profile given in Eq. ( 21.2 ), the event horizon
occurs at the point @xmath that satisfies

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

or

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The derivative of the velocity profile at the event horizon is

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Thus, the temperature predicted by the dispersionless model is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (22.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

which reduces to @xmath when @xmath is the central value of @xmath ,
i.e. when @xmath and @xmath .

For the purpose of consistency, when we form the scaled energy spectrum
of Eq. ( 22.3 ) it is the predicted temperature of Eq. ( 22.6 ) that
shall be used.

##### 22.2 Validity of discontinous velocity profile

If the change in velocity occurs over a much shorter length than some
characteristic length scale, the linearized velocity profile is invalid
and the system is better approximated by a step-discontinuous profile.
Here, the method and analysis of § 16 come into play. It was seen there
that the mode conversion - and, consequently, the temperature -
approaches a finite limiting value as the slope @xmath increases without
bound. The prediction of Eq. ( 22.6 ) cannot hold; the temperature
should approach some limiting value, @xmath , which is independent of
@xmath .

The calculation of @xmath is not conceptually difficult, but it is quite
lengthy, and has been relegated to Appendix IV . The result is

  -- -- -- --------
           (22.7)
  -- -- -- --------

(This was presented previously in Ref. [ 40 ] and is very similar to a
result given more recently in Ref. [ 42 ] .) Note that Eq. ( 22.6 )
predicts a temperature of exactly @xmath when @xmath is given by

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

It is when @xmath is on the order of this value that the transition
between the limiting forms of the temperature, given by Eqs. ( 22.6 )
and ( 22.7 ), takes place.

#### 23 Nonthermal behaviour and critical frequencies

When @xmath at some point, it might be expected that the phonon spectrum
is thermal at low frequencies, as discussed in § 22 . However, this
spectrum cannot be purely thermal, for an examination of the dispersion
relation (see Figure 20 @xmath ) shows that there is a cut-off frequency
above which mixing of positive- and negative-norm modes cannot occur.
(It may occur between @xmath - and @xmath -modes, but this coupling is
typically negligibly small.)

However, nonthermality must also come into play for low frequencies when
@xmath is nowhere equal to @xmath . Since group velocity is
frequency-dependent, there may still be group-velocity horizons for
certain frequencies, provided the velocity profile conforms to the
relations given above. There will still be a cut-off frequency @xmath ,
above which no group-velocity horizons exist and no mixing between
positive and negative norms occurs. But there will also be no
group-velocity horizons for very low frequencies, since, as @xmath , the
group velocity approaches unity. Therefore, there exists a frequency,
@xmath , which is the minimum frequency for which there exists a
group-velocity horizon (see Figure 20 @xmath ). The horizon begins, when
@xmath , at one infinity (in one of the asymptotic regions), and as
@xmath increases to @xmath , it moves smoothly to the other infinity
(the other asymptotic region).

What happens for @xmath ? Although there is no group-velocity horizon,
mixing between positive and negative norms is possible; this is
discussed in § 14 . What is more, the dimension of the space of
solutions is greater than when a group-velocity horizon exists, because
there is no merging of the @xmath - and @xmath -modes into a single
@xmath -mode. Therefore, @xmath , far from being a minimum frequency at
which norm-mixing can occur, simply marks a boundary between two
different types of behaviour, which must be treated separately in
calculations. It may be noticed that, taking the thermal prediction at
face value, it is to be concluded that virtually no radiation should be
present since @xmath is never equal to @xmath ; or, at the very least,
radiation should only be omitted in the frequency range @xmath , when
there is a group-velocity horizon. As we shall see, these predictions
are very far from the truth, and such horizons are unnecessary for the
emission of radiation.

#### 24 Phase integral analysis

Before we explore the results of numerical calculations, let us pause to
examine the results of the one analytic tool at our disposal: the phase
integral approximation of Eq. ( 17.18 ). Substituting the appropriate
wavevectors, this predicts a Hawking emission rate given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (24.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (24.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

and @xmath is defined implicitly by the conservation of @xmath according
to the dispersion relation @xmath . Beginning with the @xmath -dependent
dispersion relation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we can find @xmath as a function of @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

or

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (24.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

The only ambiguity is that @xmath , i.e., the hyperbolic tangent is
periodic in the imaginary part of its argument, with period @xmath .
@xmath , therefore, is uniquely defined up to an integer multiple of
@xmath . We restrict @xmath . A typical contour plot of the imaginary
part of @xmath is shown in Fig. 21 .

The branch cuts of Fig. 21 show clearly those values of @xmath where
@xmath , or where @xmath is real. These lines trace out the
instantaneous values of @xmath (for a particular value of @xmath ) as
one varies from one asymptotic region to the other. Their endpoints,
which are labelled in the diagram, are those values of @xmath which
correspond to plane waves in the asymptotic regions themselves, i.e.,
they are solutions of either @xmath or @xmath . The cross-bow shaped
feature, which joins together four different values of @xmath - two of
them real, two of them complex conjugates - is indicative of the
presence of a group-velocity horizon. The solutions merge at the horizon
itself, where they are equal to @xmath ; moving in one direction, they
split into two real values, reaching @xmath and @xmath in the asymptotic
region; moving in the other direction, they split into two complex
conjugate values, one of which is exponentially increasing while the
other is decreasing. The other feature corresponds to the Hawking wave,
which experiences no group-velocity horizon and simply varies from one
real value to another.

Figure 22 shows the other possibilities mentioned in § 23 . Figure 22
@xmath shows the imaginary part of @xmath in the case where @xmath . The
cross-bow pattern has disappeared, in accordance with the fact that
there is no longer a group-velocity horizon. Instead, only the complex
branches remain, so that the only real solution, for all values of
@xmath , is the negative value of @xmath . No positive-norm modes exist,
and hence no mode mixing is possible. Figure 22 @xmath corresponds to
the case where @xmath . (This requires that @xmath is nowhere equal to
@xmath .) We again have no group-velocity horizon, but this time it is
the real branches that remain, so that we have three real solutions
everywhere. Mixing of positive and negative norms is therefore possible
in both asymptotic regions.

According to Eqs. ( 24.1 ) and ( 24.2 ), we can find an approximation to
the Hawking radiation rate by taking the imaginary part of the integral
of @xmath from the initial value of @xmath to the Hawking value. If we
restrict the integration to real values of @xmath , this is simply the
integral of the imaginary part of @xmath . Fig ( 21 ) shows that we need
integrate only between @xmath and @xmath , since beyond these points,
@xmath is real. What is more, for any real value of @xmath , the
argument of the inverse hyperbolic tangent in Eq. ( 24.3 ) is real; if
the imaginary part of @xmath is not zero, then it must be equal to
@xmath . Thus we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

so that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (24.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the relation @xmath , which corresponds to conservation of norm,
this predicts a Hawking emission rate of

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (24.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

Eq. ( 24.5 ) is clearly very similar to a Planck spectrum of the form (
22.1 ), and since thermal behaviour is essentially characterised by a
@xmath pole near @xmath , we expect that Eq. ( 24.5 ) will reduce to
such a form in the limit of low frequency. Indeed, as shown in Appendix
IV , for small @xmath the wavevectors @xmath and @xmath are
approximately given by

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (24.6)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

which means that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (24.7)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus, Eq. ( 24.5 ) corresponds exactly to the Hawking prediction, with
temperature given by Eq. ( 22.6 ), in the limit of low frequency. For
higher frequencies, we expect deviations from thermality, and it remains
to be seen whether Eq. ( 24.5 ) will correspond well with numerical
results.

#### 25 Numerical results

##### 25.1 Central horizon

The typical example is one in which @xmath is the central value of the
flow velocity, so that the event horizon occurs exactly at the centre of
the variation. The asymptotic velocities @xmath and @xmath can be
replaced by the single parameter @xmath , the height of the step from
@xmath to either of the asymptotic velocities. As we have seen from Eq.
( 22.6 ), the Hawking prediction gives a temperature

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (25.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

Figure 23 shows a variety of spectra, normalized according to Eq. ( 22.3
) with the temperature given by Eq. ( 25.1 ). Figure 23 @xmath shows
several spectra with the same value of @xmath and different values of
@xmath ; Figure 23 @xmath shows spectra with the same value of @xmath
but various values of @xmath . In each plot, a pure thermal spectrum is
also shown.

These spectra (of Figs. 23 @xmath and @xmath ) all have a faster fall to
zero than the thermal spectrum, as expected: they must go to zero at the
maximum frequency @xmath , while the thermal spectrum is non-zero for
all frequencies. Also, the measured spectra all approach limiting values
for low frequencies, indicating that the creation rate @xmath always has
the @xmath pole that is characteristic of a thermal spectrum. However,
since they do not all approach a limiting value of @xmath , it is clear
that they do not all accord with the prediction of Eq. ( 25.1 ), which
seems to be true only in the limit of high @xmath and low @xmath .
(These trends have been noted previously [ 44 ] .) Recalling Eq. ( 22.4
), the limiting values of the spectra as @xmath are precisely the values
of @xmath , where @xmath is the true low-frequency temperature. Some
spectra, then, have a value of @xmath which is lower than @xmath .
Again, this is to be expected: the Hawking prediction yields a
temperature which can increase without bound, whereas we have seen that
there is a limiting temperature as @xmath (given by Eq. ( 22.7 )).

Figures 23 @xmath and @xmath plot the values of @xmath for the spectra
of @xmath and @xmath , respectively. They also show two analytic, though
heuristically derived, curves - one of which gives excellent agreement
with the measured values. To find this, let us consider the dependence
of @xmath on @xmath , i.e., we treat @xmath as fixed. It is clear that,
at low @xmath , the temperature is given by @xmath , and is thus linear
in @xmath . The temperature increases monotonically with @xmath ,
approaching the limiting value @xmath , which is independent of @xmath .
There are many functional forms that would behave as such, but the
hyperbolic tangent is a natural guess, given that the velocity profile
has precisely this form. Even so, there are two possible guesses for the
form of the temperature which behave in the required way:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (25.2)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Substituting in Eq. ( 22.7 ) the values @xmath and @xmath , we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (25.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

Plugging this into the above forms for the temperature and dividing by
@xmath , the guessed temperature curves are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (25.4)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (25.5)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

As shown in Fig. 23 , Eq. ( 25.5 ) agrees remarkably well with numerical
results, over the entire parameter space. This is the first
demonstration of such a universally valid expression for the
low-frequency temperature.

More spectra are shown in Fig. 24 , with fixed values of @xmath and
@xmath chosen so as to increase the deviation from the thermal
prediction of Eq. ( 25.1 ). The values of @xmath are also plotted, and
once again it is found that Eq. ( 25.5 ) agrees very well with numerical
results.

##### 25.2 Non-central horizon

We have seen that, when the central value of the velocity profile is
equal to @xmath , then the ratio of the measured temperature to the
predicted temperature,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is reasonable to generalise this to the case of an arbitrary velocity
profile, so long as it is equal to @xmath somewhere (for, if it is not,
then the Hawking prediction of Eq. ( 22.5 ) is inapplicable). Plugging
in the expressions for @xmath and @xmath as given in Eqs. ( 22.6 ) and (
22.7 ), respectively, then we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (25.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

or

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (25.7)
  -- -------- -- --------

Figure 25 plots the values of @xmath for various values of the
parameters @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . The independent variable in the
plot is taken to be the combination of these parameters that appears in
the argument of the hyperbolic tangent function in Eqs. ( 25.6 ). This
equation predicts that the resulting plot should be simply the
hyperbolic tangent function; that is indeed found to be the case.

When the central value of @xmath - hereafter referred to as @xmath - is
equal to @xmath , the deviation of the spectra from the thermal spectrum
occurs as a result of the cut-off frequency @xmath , so that they fall
sharply to zero as this frequency is approached. However, when @xmath is
different from @xmath , the deviations from the thermal spectrum are
much more significant. Figure 26 shows examples for different values of
@xmath ; the values of @xmath and @xmath are fixed at values such that
@xmath . The most striking difference occurs when @xmath , for then the
observed spectrum is greater than the thermal spectrum (at the
high-frequency end).

Also of note in Fig. 26 is how accurate the phase integral prediction of
Eq. ( 24.5 ) is, clearly in accordance with the deviations just
mentioned. This is the first demonstration of an analytic expression
valid over the entire spectrum. The only significant deviation occurs
very close to @xmath , when again the measured spectrum falls off more
sharply than the model predicts. It is also worth noting that the
phase-integral approximation is only accurate when the low-frequency
temperature agrees very well with the Hawking prediction, i.e., when
@xmath . Indeed, taking the low-frequency limit of Eq. ( 24.5 ) yields
precisely the temperature of Eq. ( 22.6 ). It is not clear whether the
phase integral approximation can be modified to accord with the modified
temperature of Eq. ( 25.7 ).

##### 25.3 No low-frequency horizon

What happens if there is no point at which @xmath ? Such a regime is
never examined in the literature, for it does not correspond to a black
hole in the dispersionless limit. The Hawking prediction of Eqs. ( 22.1
) and ( 22.5 ) cannot be applied, so it might be imagined that the
spectrum vanishes. However, we have already seen that the Hawking
prediction does not always apply, the relation between the temperature
and the derivative at the horizon being rather less straightforward;
and, moreover, that the spectra are not purely thermal anyway,
exhibiting large deviations from thermality when @xmath . (This would,
of course, be the case if @xmath were increased to be greater than
@xmath .) Recalling the observation made in § 14 that an event horizon
is not a necessary ingredient for Hawking radiation to be possible, we
conclude that there is no reason to suppose that the Hawking spectrum
will vanish when @xmath is everywhere greater than @xmath - except,
perhaps, that it is likely to be far from thermal.

Recall that, in this case, there are two types of frequency, separated
by a critical frequency @xmath : those frequencies above @xmath (and, of
course, below @xmath ) experience a group-velocity horizon, and are
treated in the same way as before; frequencies below @xmath , however,
do not have a group-velocity horizon, and can occur in pairs of @xmath
or @xmath modes. (We continue to ignore the backward-travelling @xmath
-modes.) We must take account of both of these pairings, and their
spectra will in general be different.

Figure 27 shows an example of such a spectrum, with @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath . It is clearly non-zero, and is also clearly non-thermal. The
two possible channels for phonon creation give very different spectra,
and, for the @xmath - @xmath pair, there is a change of behaviour at the
frequency @xmath , the spectrum reaching a maximum at this point and
approaching zero at both zero frequency and @xmath .

The numerically calculated spectra are also in good agreement with the
phase-integral approximation, although this claim requires some further
explanation. When @xmath , so that we have a group-velocity horizon, the
phase-integral approximation gives the same expression as Eq. ( 24.5 ),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (25.8)
  -- -------- -- --------

(These values are small enough that we needn’t make the modification of
Eq. ( 24.5 ).) When @xmath , this requires some modification. The
spectrum is calculated using the @xmath -in mode, the creation rates
given by the norms of the out-components for the @xmath - and @xmath
-modes. The phase integral of Eq. ( 17.17 ) is then taken between the
@xmath -branch and either the @xmath - or @xmath -branch. Taking the
@xmath - @xmath pairing first: the imaginary part of @xmath is @xmath in
the regions between the branches; however, on traversing the @xmath
-branch, @xmath is not purely real but has an imaginary part of @xmath .
The total integral, then, has an imaginary part of @xmath , and the
predicted creation rate is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (25.9)
  -- -------- -- --------

The creation rate of the @xmath - @xmath pairing would seem to have the
same expression as in Eq. ( 25.8 ). However, numerics show that the
spectrum becomes linear in @xmath as @xmath , a form not given by this
exponential factor. It is found heuristically, using the fact that both
@xmath and @xmath approach zero as @xmath , that the @xmath - @xmath
spectrum conforms to the expression

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (25.10)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Although the discontinuous ( @xmath ) velocity profile can be solved to
show that @xmath is indeed linear in @xmath at low frequencies, it is
unclear why the spectrum should obey Eq. ( 25.10 ) so well. (This may
require a more sophisticated phase-integral method, mentioned in § 17 ,
in which various solutions are linearly combined to give the required
mode; the corresponding norms might then exhibit linear combination of
various phase integrals, as suggested by Eq. ( 25.10 ).) Note that Eqs.
( 25.10 ) and ( 25.8 ) together indicate that the @xmath - @xmath
spectrum reaches a maximum at @xmath , the boundary between the
existence and non-existence of a group-velocity horizon.

However, we cannot expect the phase-integral approximation to hold
universally, and indeed it does not. If the parameters are altered in
such a way that invalidates the phase-integral approximation in the
presence of a horizon - that is, if the steepness @xmath is increased or
the step height @xmath is decreased - then the phase-integral
approximation for the case of no low-frequency horizon also becomes less
accurate. Figure 28 shows such spectra: the upper plots have the same
value of @xmath as Fig. 27 , but the step height has been decreased to
@xmath ; the lower plots have the same asymptotic velocities as Fig. 27
, but @xmath has been increased to @xmath . It is perhaps worthy of note
that the @xmath -mode spectrum deviates more from the phase-integral
prediction than does the @xmath -mode spectrum.

#### 26 Concluding remarks

The question of whether Hawking radiation is robust with respect to
dispersive effects can be answered affirmatively. Hawking radiation is
still predicted once dispersion is introduced, though the resulting
spectra are no longer purely thermal. When we have a low-frequency event
horizon, the low-frequency end of the spectrum is thermal, with a
temperature given by Eq. ( 25.7 ). This has been derived heuristically,
though it agrees with Hawking’s original result when the hyperbolic
tangent is approximately @xmath . At higher frequencies, the spectrum
deviates from thermality, though it is still well-approximated by the
phase-integral prediction of Eq. ( 24.5 ).

We have also found that, when dispersion is included, Hawking radiation
does not require the presence of a low-frequency event horizon, an
observation that does not seem to have been appreciated before. Though
@xmath might nowhere equal @xmath , a spectrum of spontaneously created
phonons is predicted, even for frequencies which do not experience a
group-velocity horizon. These spectra are non-thermal, though they can
be well-approximated by a modified phase-integral prediction, as given
in Eqs. ( 25.8 )-( 25.10 ).

This raises the question of the precise origins of the created quanta.
In the dispersionless case, which requires an event horizon for Hawking
radiation, one can imagine the creation of a virtual pair at the event
horizon, one on either side. The horizon prevents them from recombining,
so that they are rendered in reality. But when we have no event horizon
- when the created quanta may actually be emitted in the same direction,
like the @xmath - @xmath pair - how are they produced? We might say that
there is a phase -velocity horizon, for the created quanta, having
oppositely signed (free-fall) frequencies, must have oppositely directed
phase velocities. This, however, is not a well-defined concept, for the
phase velocity @xmath can never become zero if @xmath is conserved.
Moreover, if the existence of a phase-velocity horizon truly determined
the Hawking spectrum, we would expect that a greater height in the
velocity profile would increase the range of frequencies for which a
phase-velocity horizon occurs; yet, an increase in the width of this
part of the spectrum is not observed under an increase in the step
height. The origin of the radiation thus remains a mystery.

## Part III Hawking Radiation in Optical Fibres

### Chapter \thechapter Nonlinear Fibre Optics

The fluid model is difficult to implement in practice. The velocity
gradients and the Hawking temperatures they induce are typically so
small (around 10 nK [ 23 ] ) that a fluid with temperature close to
absolute zero must be used. Thus, the proposed systems of Helium-3 [ 25
, 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 ] and Bose-Einstein condensate [ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ]
represent the most feasible means of observing spontaneous particle
creation in fluids, but require sophisticated technology to do so.

From a practical viewpoint, light in moving media provides an attractive
experimental setup for the observation of Hawking radiation. Light it
the simplest of quantum objects, exhibiting quantum properties without
the need for very low temperatures. Indeed, there is evidence that
Hawking radiation has already been observed in the optical arena [ 60 ]
. In the remainder of this thesis, we shall examine the simple
one-dimensional system of light in optical fibres, a system routinely
used in the laboratory setting, looking particularly at its capacity for
event horizon analogies and the generation of Hawking radiation.

This chapter examines some of the essential physics of light in optical
fibres. After reviewing the basic linear response in § 27 , in § 28 we
look at the lowest-order nonlinear response and some of its effects,
culminating in the interaction of a soliton with a weak continuous probe
wave. Finally, in § 29 , we introduce a coordinate frame in which this
system resembles wave propagation in a dispersive moving medium, before
concluding the chapter in § 30 .

#### 27 Linear effects

Electromagnetic waves (such as light) are propagating disturbances of
electric field @xmath and magnetic field @xmath , which are governed by
Maxwell’s equations [ 61 ] :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (27.1)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (27.2)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (27.3)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (27.4)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the free current density, @xmath is the free charge
density, and @xmath and @xmath are related to @xmath and @xmath via the
constitutive relations:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (27.5)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (27.6)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

@xmath and @xmath are the polarization and magnetization, respectively.
Restricting our attention to optical fibres [ 62 , 63 ] , which are
non-magnetic ( @xmath ), non-conducting ( @xmath ) and electrically
neutral ( @xmath ), we can substitute the constitutive relations into
Maxwell’s equations and eliminate @xmath and @xmath , yielding

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (27.7)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (27.8)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (27.9)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (27.10)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

@xmath may be eliminated from these equations by taking the curl of Eq.
( 27.7 ) and substituting Eq. ( 27.8 ), resulting in the wave equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (27.11)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The product @xmath , where @xmath is the speed of light in vacuum; for
vacuum, which contains no bound charges, cannot be polarized, and has
@xmath . Optical fibres, however, are made of dielectric material, so
that @xmath is non-zero and must be accounted for.

In order to solve Eq. ( 27.11 ), we must determine the relationship
between the polarization @xmath and the electric field @xmath . Since
@xmath results from the response of bound charges within the medium to
the electric field @xmath , and this response is unlikely to be
instantaneous, our first guess at this relationship might be [ 63 ]

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (27.12)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This describes the polarization as a linear response to the electric
field, containing terms in only the first power of @xmath ; but, to
incorporate the non-instantaneous nature of the response, it is built up
of contributions from @xmath at all earlier times. The weight of the
contribution from @xmath at time @xmath before the measurement of @xmath
is given by the response function, @xmath . Substituting in Eq. ( 27.11
), the wave equation becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (27.13)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This is more readily solved by taking the Fourier transform with respect
to time [ 62 , 63 ] , which gives

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (27.14)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where we have defined

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (27.15)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (27.16)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In regions where @xmath is independent of position, i.e., where the
medium is homogeneous, Eq. ( 27.14 ) can be simplified. For, taking the
Fourier transform with respect to time of Eq. ( 27.9 ), we find

  -- -- -- ---------
           (27.17)
  -- -- -- ---------

which implies

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (27.18)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We also use the vector identity

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (27.19)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Substituting into Eq. ( 27.14 ), we find the Helmholtz equation:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (27.20)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Eq. ( 27.20 ) describes wave propagation in media. We see that the
effect of any particular medium on wave propagation depends mainly on
the linear susceptibility @xmath , and is clearly frequency-dependent.
We define the permittivity @xmath ; if the imaginary part of the
susceptibility is small, as is often the case, then @xmath is
approximately equal to @xmath . @xmath is the refractive index , and Eq.
( 27.20 ) can be written

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (27.21)
  -- -------- -- ---------

whence it is clear that the refractive index describes a
frequency-dependent wave speed: assuming a monochromatic wave, and
comparing Eq. ( 27.21 ) with the vacuum case @xmath , we see that the
vacuum wave speed @xmath is simply replaced by @xmath , and it admits
plane wave solutions of the form @xmath . So the refractive index
describes the dispersion of the fibre. Looking retrospectively at Eqs. (
27.12 )-( 27.14 ), we see that, in optical fibres, dispersion is a
consequence of the non-instantaneous linear response of the material
polarization to the electric field. It is therefore associated with a
nonlocality in time ; this should be compared to the acoustic case of
Chapter II , where the dispersion was assumed to arise from nonlocality
in space .

Confining light to an optical fibre introduces further dispersive
effects, for a fibre acts as a waveguide, forcing the waves to travel in
a single direction. Using cylindrical coordinates @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath , Eq. ( 27.21 ) becomes [ 62 , 63 ]

  -- -- -- ---------
           (27.22)
  -- -- -- ---------

Focusing for clarity on the component @xmath and separating the
variables as follows,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (27.23)
  -- -------- -- ---------

we find that Eq. ( 27.22 ) is equivalent to the following differential
equation for @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (27.24)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This is the equation for Bessel functions of order @xmath [ 64 ] . In
order that the solution for the radial dependence should be free of
singularities within the fibre core and exponentially decreasing far
from the fibre core, only a certain number of discrete solutions are
allowed, each corresponding to a particular value of @xmath . Under
certain conditions (small core radius and small refractive index
difference between core and cladding [ 63 ] ), only a single value of
@xmath corresponds to a given frequency.

For every mode, there are in fact two orthogonal solutions. (When @xmath
is single-valued, these correspond approximately to polarization of the
electric field along the @xmath - or the @xmath -axis [ 62 ] .)
Depending on the transverse structure of the fibre, these two orthogonal
modes can have different values of @xmath , so that both frequency and
polarization can affect wave speed. This phenomenon is known as
birefringence . The two polarizations are often denoted the fast and
slow axes, depending on their relative speed: hence the slow axis has a
higher refractive index than the fast axis.

Factoring out the transverse form of the guided modes (i.e., their
@xmath - and @xmath -dependence), the wave equation ( 27.21 ) is reduced
to the one-dimensional form [ 65 ]

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (27.25)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and we may define a modified refractive index to satisfy

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (27.26)
  -- -------- -- ---------

@xmath differs from @xmath in Eq. ( 27.21 ) in that it includes the
effects of waveguide dispersion, arising from the restriction of light
propagation to a single spatial dimension. In what follows, we always
assume a one-dimensional optical fibre, and for convenience we shall
simply use @xmath to mean the modified refractive index defined in Eq. (
27.26 ).

Eq. ( 27.25 ) may be transformed back to real space via the
substitutions @xmath and @xmath . At this point, however, it is
convenient to return to Eq. ( 27.11 ), and to recall that we have only
included the linear polarization in Eq. ( 27.25 ). Reintroducing the
nonlinear part of the polarization @xmath , the full wave equation in
real space becomes [ 65 ]

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (27.27)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The operator @xmath is formed by inserting the operator @xmath into the
Taylor expansion for @xmath , analogously to the operator @xmath in Eq.
( 9.4 ). When the polarization is assumed linear and @xmath , the
general solution is simply a linear superposition of plane waves with
frequency and propagation constant related by @xmath . These plane waves
evolve independently of each other. When @xmath is non-zero, the various
plane waves may couple to each other, resulting in frequency shifting
and Hawking radiation [ 65 ] .

#### 28 Nonlinear effects

We have seen how the linear polarization induced in an optical fibre
leads to dispersion and birefringence, which are frequency- and
polarization-dependencies of the phase velocity of plane waves; or,
equivalently, of the propagation constant @xmath . Both of these effects
are highly manipulable in photonic crystal fibres [ 63 , 66 ] , and can
be made relatively strong. We shall now consider nonlinear effects in
fibres.

##### 28.1 Nonlinear polarization

Although Eq. ( 27.12 ) yields accurate predictions of wave propagation
if the optical power is low, a more general form of the polarization can
be written in the manner of a Taylor series, as follows:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (28.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is of order @xmath in the electric field:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (28.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

The @xmath -order susceptibility @xmath is a tensor of rank @xmath , and
we adopt the convention that repeated indices ( @xmath , @xmath , etc.)
are summed over. Eq. ( 27.12 ) is a special case of Eqs. ( 28.1 ) and (
28.2 ) in which it is assumed that only @xmath is non-zero, and that
@xmath is simply a function of time multiplied by the identity operator.
This must be true in an isotropic medium, so @xmath will continue to
have this form. The next-highest order susceptibility, @xmath , is found
to be zero when the molecules of the dielectric are symmetric [ 63 , 67
] . This is true of silica; therefore, the lowest-order nonlinear
effects are derived from @xmath and the third-order polarization. This
is generated from the nonlinear response of electronic vibrations in the
fibre medium, and works on a timescale comparable to the transit time of
light over the diameter of an atom [ 63 ] . We can, therefore, assume
this nonlinear response to be instantaneous, and the time dependence of
@xmath to be simply the product of three delta functions:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (28.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

We have seen that there are two orthogonal polarizations of the electric
field, which we shall denote by @xmath , where the subscripts @xmath and
@xmath represent the fast and slow axes of the fibre, respectively.
There will also be two corresponding nonlinear polarizations @xmath ,
which, combining Eqs. ( 28.2 ) and ( 28.3 ), are related to @xmath by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (28.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are summed over @xmath and @xmath .
Some physical considerations help to simplify Eq. ( 28.4 ). Firstly,
note that @xmath cannot depend on odd powers of @xmath : for, if it did,
the direction of @xmath would be determined by the direction of @xmath ,
in violation of isotropy. Secondly, and also a consequence of isotropy,
we have the relation [ 63 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (28.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus, Eq. ( 28.4 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (28.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

Simple though Eq. ( 28.6 ) may be, it is useful to modify it further. So
far, we have taken @xmath and @xmath to be real quantities; however,
given their oscillatory nature, it is easier for the sake of calculation
to replace them with complex quantities by making the substitutions

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (28.7)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (28.8)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Then Eq. ( 28.6 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (28.9)
  -- -------- -- --------

Finally, we note that, in general, only that component of the
polarization @xmath which has a similar frequency to the electric field
@xmath will have a significant effect on wave propagation. (Different
frequency components require phase matching, which usually occurs only
by design.) Taking @xmath to have a positive frequency, only those terms
of @xmath which include a complex conjugate can satisfy the
frequency-matching condition. Finally, then, Eq. ( 28.9 ) becomes [ 65 ]

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (28.10)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Although Eq. ( 28.10 ) is wholly derived from the assumption of a
third-order polarization, its various terms are associated with
different qualitative effects. The first and second terms describe,
respectively, the phenomena of self-phase modulation and cross-phase
modulation ; that is, they lead to phase shifts in the electric field as
a result of either the nonlinear effect of a polarized field on itself,
or of one polarized field on the orthogonally polarized field [ 63 ] .
The third term describes four-wave mixing between the two polarizations
[ 63 ] .

The self-phase modulation term can be decomposed further. If the
electric field is composed of two distinct frequency bands, it is useful
to separate these components by writing

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (28.11)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath and @xmath are assumed to be slowly-varying compared with
the plane waves they multiply. Then the first term of Eq. ( 28.10 )
becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (28.12)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where we have neglected all terms that do not oscillate at @xmath or
@xmath (and therefore require phase matching to have a significant
effect). Thus, we see that, within a single polarization, we can
separate the nonlinear effects of a certain frequency band on itself and
on other frequency bands; these effects are also commonly referred to as
self- and cross-phase modulation, where the descriptive terms are now in
reference to the frequency rather than the direction of polarization.

##### 28.2 Optical solitons

One of the most notable consequences of third-order polarization is the
existence of stable localised solutions of the wave equation; that is,
pulses whose shapes are not distorted during propagation through the
fibre [ 63 ] . In these specific cases, the nonlinear effects contrive
to cancel the linear (dispersive) effects, which acting alone would tend
to stretch and smear the pulse. The possibility of stable pulses is
useful in forming an analogy with a moving fluid: in the frame co-moving
with a stable pulse (introduced in § 29 ), the background is
time-independent.

Let us derive these stable pulse solutions. Firstly, since we are
considering a single electric field with well-defined frequency, the
nonlinear polarization includes only the self-phase modulation term;
that is, @xmath . (The subscripts @xmath have been emitted for clarity,
though it should be remembered that @xmath may be
polarization-dependent.) Secondly, we assume the validity of the
slowly-varying envelope approximation , i.e., we write the total
electric field as the product of an envelope and a carrier wave,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (28.13)
  -- -------- -- ---------

(where @xmath ) and assume that the envelope varies on scales much
longer than an optical cycle. Specifically, this amounts to the
assumption of the validity of the following relations:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (28.14)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Under the slowly-varying envelope approximation, the two sides of the
wave equation ( 27.27 ) can be well-approximated by terms containing
only first-order derivatives:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (28.15)
     @xmath   @xmath               (28.16)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

In Eq. ( 28.15 ), when the operator @xmath acts on the envelope @xmath
rather than the full electric field @xmath , it should be remembered
that it is the difference frequency @xmath which is replaced by the
operator @xmath , and not @xmath itself. Forming a second-order Taylor
expansion of @xmath at the pulse frequency @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (28.17)
  -- -------- -- ---------

we can write Eq. ( 28.15 ) in the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (28.18)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In Eq. ( 28.16 ), we assume that the intensity @xmath also varies slowly
in comparison with the frequency @xmath , so that we can neglect the
derivative term. Making these approximations and setting the two sides
of the wave equation equal, we obtain

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (28.19)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The combination of first-order derivatives in Eq. ( 28.19 ) strongly
suggests the usefulness of the following coordinate transformation:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (28.20)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (28.21)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Since @xmath is simply the inverse of the group velocity of the pulse,
this is a transformation into a frame of reference that moves with the
pulse; we shall have more to say about it later. The partial derivatives
of the various coordinates are related as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (28.22)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (28.23)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

and substituting these in Eq. ( 28.19 ) yields

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (28.24)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Eq. ( 28.24 ) is very similar in form to the Schrödinger equation; the
only mathematical difference is that the “potential” depends on the
squared magnitude of the “wavefunction” @xmath . (Of course, there is
also the physical difference that space and time coordinates have been
interchanged, a consequence of the transformation ( 28.20 )-( 28.21 ).
We shall return to this point in § 29 .) For this reason, it is often
referred to as the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. It describes the
propagation of a pulse, taking into account dispersive effects via the
@xmath term, and nonlinear effects via the @xmath term. As has been
stated, one of its most important properties is its admittance of stable
solutions whose shapes do not change during their propagation, thus
achieving a perfect balance between the dispersive and nonlinear
effects. These solutions are only possible when @xmath , i.e., when the
group velocity dispersion is anomalous. This makes intuitive sense, for
the nonlinearity cannot be negative, and so one sign of the dispersion
should help to increase the nonlinear effects while the other should
contrive to cancel it out.

The stable solution is [ 63 , 68 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (28.25)
              @xmath   @xmath      (28.26)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (28.27)
  -- -------- -- ---------

A pulse of the form of Eq. ( 28.26 ) is called a fundamental soliton [
63 ] . (Higher-order solitons exist, with shapes which are not constant
but periodic in @xmath [ 63 , 68 ] . These, however, are not relevant to
our discussions.) Note that, at a given frequency @xmath (which must
obey the condition @xmath ), the fundamental solitons form a
one-parameter family of solutions of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation.
The parameter that characterises them is @xmath , the “width” of the
soliton. (For the intensity profile @xmath , the full-width half-maximum
is approximately @xmath ). Note that, as a consequence of its nonlinear
nature, the peak intensity of the soliton is entirely determined by
@xmath , and becomes larger as @xmath is made smaller. Thus, solitons
vary between long, weak pulses and short, intense pulses.

##### 28.3 Pulse and probe

For our purposes, we shall mostly be interested in cross-phase
modulation. We shall consider two fields: one an optical pulse, which we
usually take to be a fundamental soliton; the other a continuous-wave
probe, whose intensity is much less than that of the pulse. These are
well-separated in frequency, and we denote their central frequencies by
@xmath and @xmath , respectively. The nonlinear effects acting between
these two fields will be essentially unidirectional, with the pulse
acting on the probe, since the low intensity of the latter means that,
to a very good approximation, we can neglect any back-reaction on the
pulse. From Eqs. ( 28.10 ) and ( 28.12 ), we find that the appropriate
nonlinear polarization is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (28.28)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (28.29)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This nonlinear polarization is in the same direction as the probe field
@xmath . Substituting in the wave equation ( 27.27 ), we find

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (28.30)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the nonlinear susceptibility @xmath induced by the pulse is given
by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (28.31)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Since the propagation constant @xmath , Eq. ( 28.30 ) can be written in
the form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (28.32)
  -- -------- -- ---------

whence we see that the influence of @xmath on the probe is as a local
change of refractive index,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (28.33)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This increase in refractive index is often referred to as the Kerr
effect .

Let us briefly consider the implications of Eq. ( 28.33 ). The behaviour
of waves is usually described by a refractive index profile, and where
we restrict our attention to waves of relatively low intensity, the
refractive index, while it depends on frequency, is constant along the
fibre. Thus, a certain frequency will propagate with the same phase and
group velocity at all times, and the complexity of propagation of a
wavepacket is due to the fact that the phase and group velocities differ
for different frequencies. This is the dispersion phenomenon, which is
entirely described by the linear polarization, all higher-order
polarizations being negligible.

With the introduction of a relatively intense pulse and the third-order
polarization induced by it, a new phenomenon comes to light: while we
can still describe the behaviour of waves by a refractive index profile,
this profile now obtains a dependence on position (and time), the change
being proportional to the intensity of the pulse and thus propagating
along the fibre as the pulse does. (Recall that we have assumed an
instantaneous third-order polarization; in reality the refractive index
change will lag very slightly behind the pulse, but in most
circumstances we can neglect this lag.) If a probe wave also propagates
down the fibre, it will experience a transient increase in refractive
index and, hence, a decrease in its phase velocity. Dispersion will also
cause a small shift in the frequency of the wave. Usually, this
transient effect will be almost negligible; but, if either the phase or
group velocity of the probe is initially very close to the group
velocity of the pulse, so that their relative speed is very small, the
effect of the pulse may be very significant.

#### 29 Co-moving frame

##### 29.1 Coordinate transformation

Let us examine further the setup of an intense pulse propagating in an
optical fibre, and its effect on weak probe waves. This is most easily
done in a frame of reference in which the pulse is stationary. Such a
frame is constructed via the following coordinate transformation:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (29.1)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (29.2)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the group velocity of the pulse; this transformation is
illustrated in Figure 30 . Note that this is essentially the same as the
transformation made in Eqs. ( 28.20 ) and ( 28.21 ), the only difference
being that, instead of keeping the propagation distance, we have now
normalised it with respect to the velocity to get the propagation time.
It is very similar to a Galilean transformation, differing in that the
roles of space and time have been reversed. (This causes the
counter-propagating @xmath -modes to appear to travel backwards in time,
as shown in Fig. 30 .) It is clear that the pulse remains centered at
@xmath and is independent of @xmath , so that the nonlinear
susceptibility is simply a function of @xmath : @xmath . Note that the
transformation defined by Eqs. ( 29.1 ) and ( 29.2 ) is not a Lorentz
transformation, an inequality made more pronounced by the fact that
@xmath , the speed of a pulse in an optical fibre, is comparable with
@xmath , the speed of light in vacuum. The coordinates @xmath and @xmath
, then, do not correspond to space and time coordinates in the co-moving
frame. They do, however, define a perfectly valid (non-inertial)
coordinate system; we can solve the wave equation in this coordinate
system and invert the transformation to find the solution in the
original laboratory frame.

The partial derivatives in the co-moving and the lab frame are related
via

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (29.3)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (29.4)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Substituting into the wave equation ( 28.30 ) for the probe/pulse
system, we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (29.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is the desired wave equation for weak probe waves in the presence
of an intense pulse. It is now clear why the roles of space and time
have been switched from the usual Galilean transformation in Eqs. ( 29.1
) and ( 29.2 ): this leaves the time derivative unchanged, and hence the
operator @xmath maintains its simple form. (This should be compared with
Eq. ( 9.4 ), where the dispersion operator contains derivatives with
respect to space rather than time.)

It is more useful to express the optical wave equation in terms of the
vector potential @xmath , which is related to the electric and magnetic
fields via

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (29.6)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

for then Eq. ( 29.5 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (29.7)
  -- -------- -- --------

Although this difference may seem trivial, Eq. ( 29.7 ) is preferable to
Eq. ( 29.5 ) because it can be derived from a relatively simple
Lagrangian, analogous to that of Eq. ( 9.2 ) for the acoustic model. We
defer discussion of this until § 41 .

##### 29.2 Dispersion relation

The wave equation is generally solved by decomposing a solution into its
plane wave components. It is useful, therefore, to know the dispersion
relation in the co-moving frame, to see how these plane waves behave.
First, we must define appropriate variables. In the usual laboratory
frame, in which we have coordinates @xmath , we also have wavenumber
@xmath and frequency @xmath . These are defined as derivatives of the
phase: we assume a solution of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (29.8)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are real quantities. @xmath and @xmath are then
defined as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (29.9)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

In the co-moving frame defined by the coordinate transformation Eqs. (
29.1 ) and ( 29.2 ), we have coordinates @xmath , both of which have
dimensions of time. We define two frequencies, @xmath and @xmath , as
follows:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (29.10)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

The definitions of Eqs. ( 29.9 ) and ( 29.10 ) are related via the
transformation of the partial derivatives, Eqs. ( 29.3 ) and ( 29.4 ).
Eq. ( 29.4 ) shows that the two definitions of @xmath are equivalent,
hence the use of the same variable. Eq. ( 29.3 ) yields the relation

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (29.11)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

@xmath , then, is simply the Doppler-shifted frequency measured in the
co-moving frame. For this reason, we shall refer to it as the co-moving
frequency; in contrast, @xmath will be referred to as the lab frequency.

We saw in Eq. ( 28.33 ) that the nonlinearity @xmath behaves as an
increase in the square of the refractive index: @xmath . Assuming @xmath
is constant in both space and time, this can be incorporated into the
dispersion relation. Defining

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (29.12)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the second step is valid if @xmath , then we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (29.13)
  -- -------- -- ---------

or, rearranging,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (29.14)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

This is the dispersion relation in the co-moving frame. The effect of
the nonlinearity is to alter the form of the dispersion profile @xmath ;
it does not affect the velocity @xmath , which is assumed constant.
There are two branches of the dispersion relation, corresponding to
probe waves which propagate either with ( co-propagating , or @xmath
-modes) or against ( counter-propagating , or @xmath -modes) the pulse.
We shall deal mainly with co-propagating waves, which take the plus sign
in Eq. ( 29.13 ) and the minus sign in Eq. ( 29.14 ).

#### 30 Conclusion and discussion

The interaction between electromagnetic waves and matter is entirely
determined by the induced polarization, @xmath , of the matter. We have
seen that the linear response determines the refractive index @xmath ,
but this is not sufficient to allow different wave components to
interact. For this, we must introduce the nonlinear component of the
polarization, the lowest order of which is the third order. We have seen
that third-order polarization gives rise to several different effects,
and we paid particular attention to the existence of optical solitons
and the interaction of an intense pulse with a low-intensity probe wave.
The coordinate transformation of Eqs. ( 29.1 ) and ( 29.2 ) defines a
reference frame in which the pulse is stationary. The interaction of
this pulse with a probe wave is described by a wave equation, Eq. ( 29.7
), which in turn yields the dispersion relation of Eq. ( 29.14 ).

It is this dispersion relation that is most useful in pinning down the
analogy with waves in moving fluids. Since it is independent of @xmath ,
@xmath is a conserved quantity, much as @xmath is conserved in the
acoustic model. @xmath depends on both @xmath and @xmath , where @xmath
is in general @xmath -dependent; in the acoustic model, @xmath is a
function of @xmath and @xmath , where @xmath is in general @xmath
-dependent. The essential difference between the two models is the
following: in the acoustic model, the inhomogeneity of wave speed is due
to a change in the flow velocity, the dispersion profile remaining
unchanged; in the optical model, the flow velocity is constant, and the
change in wave speed is brought about by an effective change in the
dispersion profile, and hence a change in the wave speed with respect to
the medium. These behave differently when the effects on co-propagating
and counter-propagating wave are compared: for an inhomogeneous flow
velocity, the change in speed is in the same direction for both @xmath -
and @xmath -modes; for an inhomogeneous dispersion profile, the change
in speed is opposite in direction for @xmath - and @xmath -modes. But,
for a single branch, the two situations are indistinguishable, the total
wave velocity being the important quantity. We thus expect the
interaction of co-propagating probe waves with a light pulse to exhibit
the same features of horizons already demonstrated by the acoustic waves
in a moving medium. In the next Chapter, we shall encounter frequency
shifting, like that seen in wavepacket propagation simulations for
acoustic waves, showing that group-velocity horizons can exist in
optical fibres. In Chapter III , we shall develop the theory of
spontaneous photon creation in optical fibres, closely following the
derivation given in Chapter II for the acoustic model.

### Chapter \thechapter Frequency Shifting in Optical Fibres

The existence of event horizons in optical fibres can be demonstrated by
the classical effect of frequency shifting [ 65 , 69 ] , and it is to
this phenomenon that we first direct our attention. We begin by
expounding the black and white hole analogies, and using straightforward
geometrical optics we explain why we expect these to be induced by a
light pulse in an optical fibre. We then solve the full wave equation,
and compare our theoretical predictions with experimental observations.
There are some discrepancies. Another nonlinear effect - the Raman
effect - is invoked in an attempt to explain these discrepancies, but
ultimately it fails to do so.

The main analysis and results of this chapter are presented in Reference
[ 69 ] .

#### 31 The fiber-optical analogy and geometrical optics

As discussed in Chapter III , pulses in fibres simulate a non-trivial
flow velocity profile that moves with respect to the medium. Through the
Kerr effect, the pulse effectively increases the local refractive index
of the fiber. Since the speed of light waves is determined by the
refractive index, this behaves like a perturbation in the flow velocity
of the medium. In the co-moving frame in which the pulse is stationary,
the fiber appears as a moving medium, with constant background flow
equal in magnitude - but opposite in direction - to the velocity of the
pulse. A co-propagating wave attempts to move against this flow, and the
decrease in velocity induced by interaction with the pulse can be
described as a dip in the local flow velocity; that is, to complete the
analogy with a moving fluid, the medium must be considered as moving
faster (in the backward direction) in the vicinity of the pulse. If the
incident wave already has a low speed in the co-moving frame, then it is
possible that this dip forms an event horizon. In fact, if a horizon is
formed at all, there must be a pair of horizons: a white hole at the
pulse’s trailing edge, where the medium’s speed decreases in the
direction of flow, and a black hole horizon at the leading edge, where
the opposite occurs.

Suppose there is a frequency at which this pair of horizons is formed.
Let a wavepacket at this frequency be incident on the pulse. How does
this wavepacket behave? Numerical simulations show that it is reflected
from the pulse with a different frequency, a process called frequency
shifting . This is illustrated in Figure 31 - it is also analogous to
the frequency shifting seen in Figure 12 - and can be understood
conceptually as follows. Let us focus initially on the white hole
horizon on the pulse’s trailing edge. An incident wave, propagating
against the flow of the medium, is slowed by the increase in flow
velocity. The front of the wavepacket interacts with the pulse first,
and will be slowed down before the back of the wavepacket; this results
in a compression of its wavefronts, and an increase in its frequency. It
might be considered that this continues indefinitely, the wavepacket
becoming squashed at the horizon with ever-increasing frequency.
Dispersion, however, limits this shifting, for an increase in frequency,
as experienced by the incident wavepacket, is also accompanied by a
decrease in speed with respect to the medium (assuming normal
dispersion). At some point, the wave’s speed becomes less than the flow
velocity of the medium, and the wave is dragged back away from the
horizon. The overall result is reflection of the wavepacket at a higher
frequency: a white hole causes blueshifting .

A similar process can occur at the black hole horizon on the pulse’s
leading edge, but it is more difficult to describe in real time.
Thankfully, the time-reversal symmetry of black holes and white holes
can be invoked here: the process that occurs at the black hole horizon
is simply the time-reverse of a corresponding process at the white hole
horizon. If a certain frequency is blueshifted by the white hole
horizon, then the resulting frequency will be shifted back to the
original frequency by the black hole horizon. A black hole, then, causes
redshifting .

The value of the frequency shift is easily determined, for the frequency
shifting process must conform to the conservation of co-moving
frequency, @xmath . This allows a diagrammatic interpretation of the
process. Let us examine the dispersion relation, including the @xmath
-dependent change induced by the pulse, so that @xmath becomes a
function of both @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (31.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

(Recall that @xmath is approximately equal to @xmath .) The co-moving
frequency is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (31.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

Assuming @xmath and @xmath are given, the condition that @xmath is
constant determines a family of contours in the @xmath - @xmath plane.
An example is shown in Fig. 32 . The incoming lab frequency @xmath
determines the value of @xmath ( @xmath far from the pulse), and hence
on which of these contours the wave lies. During the interaction, it
must always lie on this contour. Frequency shifting, which causes
reflection in the co-moving frame, takes place in a frequency window
around the frequency @xmath at which the group velocity in the co-moving
frame vanishes; @xmath is the group-velocity-matching frequency which
has the same group velocity as the pulse. Taylor expanding @xmath around
this frequency, we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (31.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . Using the fact that @xmath is the inverse of the group
velocity, and so @xmath , plugging this into Eq. ( 31.2 ) gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (31.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

or

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (31.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . Around the group-velocity-matching frequency, the
contours of constant @xmath form parabolas centred at @xmath . When a
wave first encounters the pulse, it moves to a higher value of @xmath ,
and its lab frequency @xmath must also change accordingly. The end
result depends on the maximum value of @xmath . It is seen from Eq. (
31.5 ) that the height of the contour is @xmath . If this is greater
than @xmath , then the wave cannot pass over the peak of the contour. It
sees the pulse as a transient change in velocity, moving to a slightly
different frequency while traversing it, then returning to its original
frequency on clearing the pulse; it experiences no event horizon. On the
other hand, if the height of the contour is less than @xmath , the
situation is very different: now, the wave cannot pass over the peak of
the pulse , and must pass over the peak of the contour instead. Thus it
lands at the shifted frequency @xmath (the second zero of the parabola),
whose group velocity is opposite to that of the incident frequency. The
position of the event horizon is well-defined: it is that point at which
the value of @xmath is equal to the height of the contour, and beyond
which the wave cannot penetrate. What is more, the contour whose height
is equal to @xmath marks the edge of the frequency window for which
frequency shifting is possible: those frequencies enclosed within this
contour will experience an event horizon and be frequency-shifted, while
those outside of this contour will be able to pass through the pulse.

#### 32 Wave solutions of the pulse-probe interaction

So far, we have used geometrical optics - in which waves travel on
well-defined ray trajectories - to discuss the frequency shifting
process. This led to the conclusion that a given wave will either pass
through the pulse or be reflected from it at a shifted frequency. Real
waves, however, are spatially extended, and cannot have well-defined
values of both @xmath and @xmath as required by Eq. ( 31.2 ). Frequency
shifting can be described more accurately by a full wave treatment of
the optical field.

Firstly, let us define the difference frequencies

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

so that the dispersion relation (not including any local perturbations
due to the pulse) is simply

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (32.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

Defining the envelope @xmath such that the probe field @xmath , the
pulse-probe interaction is described by the wave equation [ 63 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (32.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the optical power of the pulse, @xmath is the nonlinear
coefficient at the group-velocity-matching frequency, and @xmath is a
dimensionless constant that depends on the relative polarization of the
pulse and probe ( @xmath for co-polarized, @xmath for cross-polarized).
We have assumed that the intensity of the probe is very weak compared to
that of the pulse, so that any back-reaction on the pulse and any
self-interaction of the probe is negligible.

Assuming the pulse power @xmath is independent of @xmath , Eq. ( 32.2 )
is equivalent in form to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.
Factoring out a @xmath -dependent phase,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (32.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

leads to the time-independent form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (32.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we used Eq. ( 32.1 ) to simplify the left-hand side.

If the pulse power @xmath is truly independent of @xmath , then the
pulse must be a fundamental soliton. Therefore, the optical power has
the form

  -- -- -- --------
           (32.5)
  -- -- -- --------

where @xmath is the soliton width (full width at half maximum @xmath ),
@xmath is the nonlinear coefficient at the soliton frequency @xmath ,
and @xmath (since solitons can only exist in regions of anomalous
dispersion). Eq. ( 32.4 ) now becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (32.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

This equation is exactly solvable (see Problem 4, §25 of Ref. [ 59 ] );
the solution is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (32.7)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (32.8)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath is a hypergeometric function:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Although Eq. ( 32.7 ) is exact, it is not especially helpful in this
form. Its complicated nature makes it very difficult to use in
calculations, and it is not obvious what the solution actually looks
like. Fortunately, it is relatively easy to simplify it. Since the
“potential” of Eq. ( 32.4 ) is proportional to the pulse power, it is
non-zero only in a relatively short region; outside this region, the
general solution is simply a sum of the plane waves @xmath and @xmath .
These are precisely the plane waves converted into each other by
frequency shifting (they share the same value of @xmath , and are
equidistant from the group-velocity-matching frequency @xmath , which of
course has a difference frequency @xmath ). So, in the limit @xmath (or
@xmath ), the exact solution Eq. ( 32.7 ) should degenerate into sums of
these plane waves. Indeed, the solution is normalized such that, as
@xmath , @xmath . In the other asymptotic region, as @xmath , the form
of @xmath is found to be

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Multiplying through by a constant, we can write the asymptotic form of
the solution

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (32.9)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have defined

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (32.10)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -- -- ---------
           (32.11)
  -- -- -- ---------

Assuming for the moment that @xmath is positive - that is, @xmath is
greater than the group-velocity-matching frequency @xmath - the
asymptotic solutions of Eq. ( 32.9 ) describe a plane wave, @xmath ,
incident on the pulse from negative @xmath . This implies, in the lab
frame, that the wave of frequency @xmath has a group velocity less than
that of the pulse, and that the pulse is able to catch up with it. It
interacts with the pulse’s leading edge, where there may be a black hole
event horizon. There is thus a reflected component, @xmath , at a lower
(redshifted) frequency and travelling back towards negative @xmath (or
with group velocity faster than that of the pulse in the lab frame).
There is also a transmitted component, @xmath , at the original
frequency and continuing on towards positive @xmath , having managed to
traverse the entire pulse. Unlike geometrical optics, in which a wave is
either reflected or transmitted, the wave picture shows that these two
effects are always present, albeit in varying degrees. The relative
amounts of wave energy which are reflected or transmitted are given by
the squared moduli @xmath and @xmath , with conservation of energy
encoded in the identity @xmath . We find

  -- -- -- ---------
           (32.12)
  -- -- -- ---------

The reflection and transmission coefficients are plotted in Fig. 33 .
Note that we have total reflection at @xmath , and that the amount of
reflection decreases as we move away from the group-velocity-matching
frequency. This is in accordance with our expectation that frequency
shifting should occur most strongly for frequencies close to @xmath , so
that, in the co-moving frame, they are significantly slowed by the
pulse.

We have seen that the solution Eq. ( 32.7 ) corresponds to redshifting
at the black hole horizon when @xmath is positive. Blueshifting at the
white hole horizon must also correspond to some solutions of Eq. ( 32.6
), but these are not found simply by allowing @xmath to be negative. The
reason is that the blueshifting process occurs at the trailing edge of
the pulse, so that the incoming and reflected waves must be present for
@xmath , while only the transmitted wave should be present for @xmath .
The solution of Eq. ( 32.7 ) clearly does not share this basic property
of the blueshifting process. Rather, we must make use of the reflection
symmetry of the wave equation ( 32.6 ), i.e., its invariance under the
transformation @xmath . This means that, if @xmath is a solution, then
@xmath is also a solution. This transformation simply changes the sign
of @xmath in Eq. ( 32.7 ), while the asymptotic solutions become

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This corresonds precisely to blueshifting at the white hole horizon: the
plane wave @xmath , with frequency less than @xmath , is incident from
positive values of @xmath (i.e., in the lab frame, it has a group
velocity greater than that of the pulse, and catches up with it); this
results in a reflected blueshifted wave, @xmath , which travels back
toward positive @xmath ; and a transmitted wave, @xmath , a part of the
original frequency which has managed to traverse the whole pulse. Note
that the reflection and transmission amplitudes are exactly the same as
for the redshifting case.

#### 33 General solution

A general solution of Eq. ( 32.2 ) can be expressed as a linear
combination of eigenfunctions (those solutions with a specified value of
@xmath ). In order to form such an expression, the coefficients of the
various eigenfunctions must be obtainable. This is possible through
product integration if the eigenfunctions themselves are orthonormal. We
first ensure that we have a complete, orthonormal set of eigenfunctions,
and then we use them to form a general solution of the pulse-probe
interaction.

The functions @xmath and @xmath - where @xmath varies from zero to
infinity - form a complete set of solutions of the wave equation ( 32.6
). Those with different values of @xmath have different eigenvalues, and
are therefore orthogonal. However, @xmath has the same eigenvalue as
@xmath ; these solutions are degenerate, and need not be orthogonal. In
order to have a complete set of orthonormal solutions, we define the
following sets of functions:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

@xmath and @xmath are even and odd functions of @xmath , respectively.
Their product is therefore odd, and integrates to zero, so by virtue of
their definitions @xmath and @xmath are orthogonal to each other. The
overall factor of @xmath ensures that they are ortho normal , i.e., that
their products integrate to give @xmath . Since the integral over any
finite region must be finite, the contribution to the @xmath function
comes from integration over the asymptotic regions. Let us, then, write
the asymptotic expressions explicitly:

  -- -- -- --------
           (33.1)
  -- -- -- --------

  -- -- -- --------
           (33.2)
  -- -- -- --------

Then the product of @xmath with itself gives

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where, in the last line, we have included only terms in @xmath , since
the positivity of @xmath means that @xmath is always equal to zero, and
any finite contributions can be ignored on the grounds that the exact
solution must be proportional to a @xmath function (since it is a
solution of the Schrödinger equation). The coefficient of the second
term can be rewritten with @xmath set equal to @xmath :

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

Conservation of energy, as mentioned previously, implies @xmath . The
product @xmath can be calculated directly from Eqs. ( 32.10 ) and (
32.11 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Given the definition of @xmath in Eq. ( 32.8 ), @xmath and @xmath are
either purely real or complex conjugates of each other. @xmath , then,
is purely imaginary, and @xmath . Therefore, @xmath , and we have

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

as desired. An entirely analogous calculation shows that @xmath and,
consequently, that

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

The general solution of Eq. ( 32.2 ), where @xmath is given by Eq. (
32.5 ), is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (33.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have replaced the phase factor that was removed in the
transition from the time-dependent to the time-independent Schrödinger
equation (see Eq. ( 32.3 )). The coefficients @xmath and @xmath are
arbitrary, but they are completely determined by the inital form of
@xmath . The orthonormality condition on the eigenfunctions allows their
calculation:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (33.4)
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

#### 34 Solution for a continuous wave

In experiment [ 65 ] , a soliton is sent into the fiber alongside a
continuous probe wave, whose frequency we denote @xmath ( @xmath ). The
initial form of the probe wave, @xmath , is its value at the entrance to
the fiber ( @xmath ) as a function of time, since here @xmath . Thus,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (34.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the coefficients @xmath are just Fourier transforms of (complex
conjugates of) eigenfunctions:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (34.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have defined

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (34.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

Plugging Eq. ( 34.2 ) into Eq. ( 33.3 ), then taking its Fourier
transform, we find:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (34.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

These Fourier transforms can be calculated to a very good approximation
if we perform the Fourier integration using the asymptotic forms of Eqs.
( 33.1 ) and ( 33.2 ). These give

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (34.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (34.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

Plugging Eqs. ( 34.5 ) and ( 34.6 ) into Eq. ( 34.4 ), we find that we
can write @xmath as a sum of three distinct terms, corresponding to
different terms of the integrand when Eqs. ( 34.5 ) and ( 34.6 ) are
substituted in Eq. ( 34.4 ). The products of @xmath functions with other
@xmath functions indicate the appearance of a @xmath function in the
result; cross terms of @xmath functions with poles can be evaluated by
simple substitution; and only terms involving products of poles remain
to be integrated. Separating these terms explicitly,

  -- -- -- --------
           (34.7)
  -- -- -- --------

The @xmath function arises because, far from the pulse, the initial
probe wave evolves as if it were purely a continuous wave; in other
words, the presence of the pulse affects only a finite portion of the
probe wave. This term, then, is the same as would be expected if there
were no pulse present at all. Since, in that case, plane waves have the
form @xmath (see Eq. ( 32.1 )), we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

@xmath is fairly straightforward to evaluate, although some care must be
taken with regard to the signs of @xmath and @xmath since the integral
is only half infinite. The result is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where we have defined

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The remaining term, @xmath , can, after some manipulation, be brought to
the simplified form

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

where we have defined

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Combining these, we find a more illuminating form of the spectrum than
Eq. ( 34.7 ); that is, we can write

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (34.8)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have defined

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (34.9)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Rather than splitting into three parts for mathematical convenience, as
in Eq. ( 34.7 ), we see in Eq. ( 34.8 ) that the spectrum splits into
three parts of physical significance: a @xmath function at the input
frequency @xmath , a shoulder surrounding this @xmath function, and a
peak at the shifted frequency @xmath .

Figure 34 shows plots of the predicted spectrum of Eq. ( 34.8 ),
together with experimentally observed frequency-shifting spectra.

#### 35 The Raman effect

Despite the careful analysis given above, there is a discrepancy between
the theoretical predictions it generates and the experimental results.
Qualitatively, the appearance of the @xmath function and the peaks at
the initial and shifted frequencies has been explained. However, there
is disagreement over the relative heights of these peaks, and there are
noticeable differences with regard to the side-bands, which are
relatively small according to theory but quite prominent in experiment.

A possible explanation for these discrepancies is our neglect of the
Raman effect [ 63 ] in the previous calculation. Whereas the Kerr effect
- which is responsible for the interaction between the pulse and the
probe - is caused by the nonlinear response of the electrons of the
fiber medium to the electric field, the Raman effect is caused by the
nonlinear response of the nuclei (i.e., molecular vibrations) of the
fibre medium. This nuclear response is much slower than the electronic
response, and in silica takes place on a time scale of around @xmath [
70 , 71 , 72 , 73 ] . For pulses much longer than this, the nuclear
response is essentially instantaneous and cannot be distinguished from
the electronic response, so that there is no discernible Raman effect.
However, for pulses with lengths on the same order as this time scale,
the nuclear response cannot be regarded as instantaneous, and new
effects emerge. Energy is transferred to vibrational modes within the
fiber, at the cost of energy of the pulse. This causes a gradual
redshift of the pulse’s carrier frequency; and, since the pulse is a
soliton and exists in a region of anomalous dispersion, this redshift is
accompanied by a decrease in its group velocity. As far as frequency
shifting is concerned, this deceleration is the Raman effect’s most
important consequence. As we have seen, energy is shifted between
frequencies that are equidistant from the group-velocity-matching
frequency, @xmath , but this depends crucially on the group velocity of
the pulse. Since the dispersion at @xmath is normal, @xmath must
increase as @xmath decreases, and an incident probe wave will be
reflected at a frequency which is continuously increasing.

To account for a decelerating pulse, the coordinate transformation that
moves into a co-moving frame must be different from that which we have
used. Suppose that, in the lab frame, the pulse propagates with velocity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (35.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath has units of acceleration. The time taken for the pulse to
propagate a distance @xmath is

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

Note that this is valid only when @xmath ; this is true if the relative
change in the velocity of the pulse is much less than unity. The
co-moving frame - in which the pulse appears stationary - can be
described by the coordinates

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (35.2)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

These coordinates reduce to those of a reference frame with uniform
velocity @xmath as @xmath . Partial derivatives transform according to
the chain rule:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (35.3)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Just as we define wavenumber and frequency in the lab frame as
derivatives of the phase,

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

so we define two frequencies in the co-moving frame as derivatives of
@xmath and @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

and these are related via the transformation of partial derivatives
given above. As before, we find @xmath is the same in both frames (hence
the use of the same label). On the other hand,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where, in the second step, we have imposed the condition that @xmath be
positive, and hence that all waves be forward-propagating. The only
difference from the non-decelerating case is the appearance of a @xmath
-dependent term.

To find the optical wave equation in the decelerating frame, we return
to the full wave equation,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (35.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath , an identity that holds true even in the non-decelerating
case, the terms @xmath and @xmath are unaltered from the previous
analysis, while @xmath is computed below. As before, we define the
slowly-varying envelope @xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where we have replaced the lab coordinates @xmath and @xmath with the
new coordinates of the decelerating frame, as defined in Eq. ( 35.2 ).
Then, from previous calculations, we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (35.5)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (35.6)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

For @xmath , we substitute the partial derivatives given in Eq. ( 35.3
):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (35.7)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where, in the last step, we used the slowly-varying envelope
approximation to neglect the second-order derivatives @xmath and @xmath
. Substituting Eqs. ( 35.5 )-( 35.7 ) into Eq. ( 35.4 ), we find the
wave equation for the envelope @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It can be shown that the second term of each bracket is negligibly small
in comparison to the first, so that this simplifies to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (35.8)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us make the substitution

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (35.9)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Then Eq. ( 35.8 ) becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and, rearranging, we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (35.10)
  -- -------- -- ---------

If the pulse is a fundamental soliton, this becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (35.11)
  -- -------- -- ---------

As in the non-decelerating case, we have arrived at a wave equation
equivalent in form to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The
mathematical effect of the deceleration is now made apparent: the
Schrödinger “potential” now includes not only the pulse intensity, but
also a term linear in @xmath and proportional to the magnitude of the
deceleration.

#### 36 Accelerated waves in the absence of a pulse

Given the typically short duration of the pulse, we are, as before, more
interested in asymptotic solutions of Eq. ( 35.10 ) which hold in the
limit @xmath . In these regions, the intensity of the pulse is zero, and
the wave equation is simply

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (36.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

Factoring out a @xmath -dependent phase,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (36.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a free parameter (analogous to energy in the usual
Schrödinger equation), the wave equation is transformed to the form of
the time-independent Schrödinger equation,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (36.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

This can be simplified further by defining the dimensionless variables

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (36.4)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

where the characteristic time scale @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (36.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then Eq. ( 36.3 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (36.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is the well-known Airy equation; its solutions are the Airy
functions @xmath and @xmath . Since @xmath increases exponentially as
@xmath , in the absence of a pulse @xmath represents the only physical
solution.

Let us pause to consider the meanings of the parameters @xmath and
@xmath . Consider the Airy function @xmath , plotted in Fig. ( 35 ): for
positive @xmath , it decays exponentially; for negative @xmath , its
amplitude decays as @xmath , while it oscillates with continuously
increasing frequency @xmath .

@xmath is a wave scale; it determines the characteristic oscillation
period of the envelope. As we would expect, these oscillations become
more prominent for larger acceleration @xmath , since @xmath - and hence
the oscillation period - decreases.

@xmath represents the “turning point” which marks the boundary between
oscillatory behaviour and exponential decay; it is a point beyond which
the wave barely penetrates. This boundedness of the wave is closely
related to pulse trapping [ 74 , 75 , 76 , 77 ] , which was explained by
Gorbach and Skryabin [ 78 ] using a linear “gravity-like” potential like
that in Eq. ( 36.1 ).

The general solution of Eq. ( 36.1 ) is found by replacing the phase of
Eq. ( 36.2 ) and forming a linear superposition of the eigenfunctions
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (36.7)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 37 Including the pulse-probe interaction

Complete solutions of the pulse-probe interaction, where the pulse
experiences a Raman deceleration, must obey Eq. ( 35.10 ). However,
there is no analytic solution for a potential which includes both a
linear term and the soliton ( @xmath ) term. We require a further
approximation in order to find analytic expressions for the
eigenfunctions. We shall assume that the Raman deceleration can be
neglected on time scales of the order of the soliton width @xmath ; that
is, we assume that there is a region outside, but close to, the pulse,
in which the solutions found for a non-decelerating pulse (Eqs. ( 32.7 )
and ( 32.9 )) are valid. (We can include the asymptotic solutions
because these are valid wherever the pulse intensity is essentially
zero.) The solutions here can be matched to Airy functions @xmath and
@xmath in the asymptotic regions.

We have already made one important conclusion about the solutions in the
decelerating case: due to the exponentially increasing behaviour of
@xmath , the solution as @xmath must contain @xmath exclusively. The
pulse-probe interaction, then, must manifest itself through the
appearance of a term including @xmath in the asymptotic region @xmath .
The general solution for @xmath is then

  -- -- -- --------
           (37.1)
  -- -- -- --------

where @xmath is a prefactor that ensures the eigenfunctions are
normalized according to the condition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (37.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

At least for the exact solutions, it must be possible to choose @xmath
such that this normalization condition holds, since they are simply
solutions of the Schrödinger equation. The @xmath function, however, is
determined by the asymptotics of the integrand, so we may use the
asymptotic forms of Eq. ( 37.1 ) to find @xmath . The integral over
positive @xmath involves the product of two @xmath functions; since
@xmath decays exponentially for positive @xmath ( @xmath [ 79 , 64 ] ),
this integral is finite, and cannot contribute to the @xmath function.
We are then left with the integral over negative @xmath , where the Airy
functions are oscillatory [ 79 , 64 ] :

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

and similarly for @xmath with @xmath replaced by @xmath . The products
@xmath and @xmath result in a cosine term whose argument is the
difference of the arguments of the individual terms; more explicitly, we
have

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where, in the last line, we have included only the @xmath function. This
calculation also holds for the integral of @xmath . For the mixed
product @xmath , the relevant term is a sine rather than a cosine, so we
have

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The last line includes only the @xmath function term, which vanishes.
Therefore, on substitution of Eq. ( 37.1 ) into Eq. ( 37.2 ), we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which holds if the normalizing prefactor is defined to be

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (37.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

All that remains is to find the coefficients @xmath and @xmath . For
this purpose, it is useful to distinguish three cases: @xmath , @xmath
and @xmath .

In the case @xmath , the turning point is far on the negative side. We
can argue, as before, that due to its exponentially increasing behaviour
for positive argument, @xmath cannot appear here, and the solution is
purely @xmath . In terms of the coefficients, this implies @xmath and
@xmath . From the perspective of geometrical optics, the probe wave
turns around before it has a chance to interact with the pulse, so the
solution is essentially the same as if no pulse were present.

In the case @xmath , the behaviour of the Airy functions near @xmath is
not well-approximated by either of their asymptotic forms, so there are
no approximations that can be made. Instead, we must directly solve Eq.
( 35.11 ), or, with the @xmath -dependent phase of Eq. ( 36.2 ) and the
dimensionless variables defined in Eqs. ( 36.4 ) and ( 36.5 ), the
following equation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (37.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is done by picking a point @xmath situated well outside the soliton
(typically, @xmath ), setting the value and first derivative of @xmath
at @xmath to be @xmath and @xmath , respectively, and solving Eq. ( 37.4
) back to, say, @xmath . The solution in the region between @xmath and
@xmath is then fitted to the linear combination @xmath .

In the case @xmath , the turning point is far on the positive side, and
the behaviour of the Airy functions near @xmath is oscillatory. We can
write asymptotic expressions as previously, this time treating @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (37.5)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (37.6)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Combining these expressions leads to the expression for a plane wave in
terms of Airy functions, valid near @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (37.7)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath is, of course, given simply by the complex conjugate of this. We
may now use the non-decelerating solutions of Eq. ( 32.9 ) to find the
decelerating solutions. Starting from the fact that the solution for
positive @xmath must be @xmath (we ignore the normalization for now), we
expand this using Eq. ( 37.5 ) above to find the form of the solution,
for positive @xmath , near the soliton:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Eq. ( 32.9 ) transforms this into a solution, still near the soliton,
but for negative @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath and @xmath are the reflection and transmission amplitudes
defined in Eqs. ( 32.10 ) and ( 32.11 ). We may now use Eq. ( 37.7 ) and
its complex conjugate to express this solution in terms of Airy
functions, allowing it to hold for all negative @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

We can now read off the expressions for the coefficients @xmath and
@xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (37.8)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (37.9)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

#### 38 Solution in the decelerating case

Having derived the form of the eigenfunctions when a constant
deceleration of the pulse is included, we now use these in the
calculation of the spectrum due to frequency shifting. The general
solution of Eq. ( 37.4 ) is a linear superposition of the eigenfunctions
@xmath with the @xmath -dependent phase of Eq. ( 36.2 ) replaced:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (38.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

The coefficients @xmath are completely determined by the value of @xmath
at @xmath ; for, using the orthonormality condition of Eq. ( 37.2 ), we
have

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The general solution for the envelope @xmath , where the electric field
@xmath , is found by replacing the phases extracted in Eq. ( 35.9 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (38.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

As before, our initial wave is the value of the continuous-wave probe at
the input of the fibre ( @xmath ); that is,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (38.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . The coefficients @xmath , then, are given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where we have defined the Fourier-transformed eigenfunction

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (38.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

The continuous wave of Eq. ( 38.3 ) therefore evolves according to

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

and the probe envelope is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In order to find the power spectrum, which is the measured quantity in
experiment, we must take the Fourier transform of the probe envelope,
which gives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (38.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is not yet in a form suitable for numerical integration, because
the spectrum contains a @xmath function, for the same reason given in
the non-decelerating case: a finite portion of the probe wave interacts
with the pulse, while far from the pulse it evolves just as a continuous
wave in the absence of a pulse. We therefore expect Eq. ( 38.5 ) to
contain a term @xmath , and this must first be extracted in order to
make the numerical integration stable. To this end, we introduce some
further definitions. Consider the identity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (38.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

as motivation for the following definitions:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (38.7)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (38.8)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Both @xmath and @xmath must approach zero as @xmath , while as @xmath ,
@xmath approaches unity while @xmath diverges exponentially. Note that
Eqs. ( 38.6 ) and ( 38.7 ) together imply the following:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (38.9)
  -- -------- -- --------

Substitution of Eqs. ( 38.7 )-( 38.9 ) in Eq. ( 38.4 ) gives, for the
Fourier-transformed eigenfunction,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (38.10)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where we have defined

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (38.11)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The function @xmath approaches unity both as @xmath and as @xmath . It
is this asymptotic behaviour that generates the @xmath function.
Plugging Eq. ( 38.10 ) into Eq. ( 38.5 ), we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (38.12)
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

#### 39 Comparison with experimental results

In order to take the Raman deceleration into account, we must have some
idea of its value, or, equivalently, of the value of @xmath . This can
be estimated from measurable quantities as follows. Dispersion is
normally measured via the group-velocity dispersion @xmath , or, since
@xmath is simply the inverse of the group velocity, @xmath . If the
wavelength shift of the soliton, @xmath , is measured, then we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (39.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are the initial and final values of the
soliton’s group velocity, and @xmath is the value of @xmath at the
soliton wavelength. Then

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (39.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the initial velocity of the soliton, and we have assumed
that its fractional change over the course of the fibre is much less
than unity. According to Eq. ( 35.1 ), we have @xmath , where @xmath is
the length of the fibre. Therefore,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (39.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

Plugging this into the definition of @xmath (Eq. ( 36.5 )), and using
the identity @xmath , we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (39.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

In our experimental setup, this gives @xmath .

The above derivation of the value of @xmath took an experimentally
observed value of the soliton wavelength shift, @xmath . We may also
reinforce the conclusion by using an analytic expression for this shift
(as given in Reference [ 63 ] ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (39.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the soliton width (as appears in Eq. ( 32.5 )) and
@xmath is a Raman parameter that is found to be around @xmath in silica.
The change in wavelength is therefore

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (39.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

Plugging this into Eq. ( 39.4 ), we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (39.7)
  -- -------- -- --------

Again, we find @xmath .

Figure 36 shows plots of the theoretical predictions for the spectra -
both without (Eq. ( 34.8 )) and with (Eq. ( 38.12 )) the Raman effect -
and the experimentally observed spectra. We see that, if @xmath is taken
to be @xmath as deduced above, then the Raman deceleration of the
soliton has very little effect: the spectra are almost the same as those
calculated when the soliton propagates at a constant speed. Plots are
also shown when @xmath takes a value of @xmath , for it is only at
around this value that the Raman effect makes appreciable differences to
the frequency-shifting spectra. Since @xmath , this corresponds to a
deceleration - and a wavelength shift - higher than the deduced values
by a factor of @xmath . It thus appears that the discrepancies between
theory and experiment are not due to the Raman effect.

#### 40 Conclusion and discussion

The Kerr interaction between pulse and probe does, indeed, induce the
equivalent of a group-velocity horizon for some probe frequencies.
Frequency shifting occurs, and has been experimentally observed. The
theoretical prediction varies negligibly when the Raman effect is taken
into account - the Raman deceleration must be increased by an order of
magnitude before it has any noticeable effect. However, a discrepancy
between theory and experiment remains, and is as yet unresolved.

### Chapter \thechapter The Fibre-Optical Model for Hawking Radiation

The previous chapter has shown that pulses in optical fibres do exhibit
features of black- and white-hole horizons, and that the effects of
these horizons are experimentally detectable. This raises expectations
that Hawking radiation might also be among these features. In this
chapter, we present an analysis almost exactly analogous to that of
Chapter II , but using instead the probe/pulse system described in §§ 28
and 29 . This shall lead us to conclude that Hawking radiation is indeed
possible in this system.

#### 41 Action and scalar product

We begin, as before, with an action integral:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (41.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Lagrangian for electromagnetic fields is given by [ 80 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (41.2)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The refractive index depends on both the dispersion of the fibre and, as
we have seen (see Eq. ( 28.33 )), on the nonlinearity induced by a
pulse. Given that the dispersion is normally described via the
propagation constant @xmath , the Lagrangian is naturally modified to
include the dispersive and nonlinear effects as follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath                     (41.3)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where, in the second line, we have transformed to the coordinates @xmath
and @xmath via the transformation of Eqs. ( 29.3 ) and ( 29.4 ). Then,
plugging into the Euler-Lagrange equation ( 9.3 ) (with appropriate
re-labelling), we find the wave equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (41.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the case where the fibre is dispersionless, with a refractive index
@xmath that is independent of frequency, the Lagrangian reduces to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (41.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

and we see that the effect of the nonlinearity @xmath is to increase the
refractive index in accordance with Eq. ( 28.33 ). Unfortunately, Eq. (
41.5 ) cannot be written in the form for a massless scalar field, i.e.,
there is no metric such that @xmath . For, in order to find such a
metric, we must multiply Eq. ( 41.5 ) by a factor of @xmath , and since
@xmath is @xmath -dependent, this alters the wave equation. However, we
can gain some insight by continuing down this road, the following
results being exact if @xmath is constant. The resulting Lagrangian
corresponds to a massless scalar field in a spacetime with metric

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (41.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

Comparing with the general form of Eq. ( 1.7 ), we see that Eq. ( 41.6 )
describes a moving medium in which the flow velocity is constant (
@xmath ), but the velocity of null trajectories (i.e., the velocity of
waves) with respect to the medium has the @xmath -dependent value @xmath
. This is in accordance with the discussion in § 30 : the pulse affects
not the velocity of the fibre, but of the waves with respect to the
fibre. An event horizon is established wherever @xmath , and the Hawking
temperature is given, as in Eq. ( 7.3 ), by the derivative of the wave
velocity at the horizon:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (41.7)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is inexact, but we shall see in § 53 that, if @xmath at some point
and the variation in @xmath is small, the resulting Hawking temperature
does indeed agree with Eq. ( 41.7 ).

Returning to the exact Lagrangian of Eq. ( 41.3 ), we remark that, like
its acoustic counterpart (see § 9 ), it is invariant with respect to
both translation in @xmath (“time” translation) and phase rotation of
@xmath . The former leads to the existence of stationary modes,
discussed in the next section; the latter leads to conservation of the
scalar product

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (41.8)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where @xmath is the canonical momentum,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (41.9)
  -- -------- -- --------

In regions where @xmath is constant in @xmath , the formula for the
scalar product can be written in a more instructive form. We separate
the branches of the dispersion relation into those with positive and
negative lab frame wavenumbers, i.e., we define the two branches via the
dispersion relations @xmath and @xmath , or

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (41.10)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath . (Note that the minus sign in Eq. ( 41.10 ) corresponds to
a positive lab-frame wavenumber, and vice versa.) Any solution of the
optical wave equation can be expressed as a sum of two Fourier
integrals, covering the two branches of the dispersion relation:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (41.11)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The canonical momentum, defined in Eq. ( 41.9 ), is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (41.12)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Then, applying Eq. ( 41.8 ) for the scalar product, we find

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (41.13)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the case of the norm of a wave - the scalar product of the wave with
itself - this becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (41.14)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This is completely analogous to the acoustic case, where we also found
(see § 10 ) that the norm was determined by the difference of the
squared magnitudes of the Fourier components corresponding to the two
different branches of the dispersion relation. That these contribute to
the norm with different signs means that it is possible to increase the
norm of each separately while maintaining the value of the overall norm;
this corresponds to pair creation. Our switching of the roles of space
and time has caused the integration to be over @xmath (rather than
@xmath ), and the factor multiplying the Fourier components is the
lab-frame wavenumber (rather than the free-fall frequency).

#### 42 Decomposition into modes

Just as for the acoustic field, we can express the general optical field
@xmath as a linear superposition of orthonormal modes. For now, we shall
continue to assume that @xmath is constant in @xmath (this condition is
relaxed in § 43 ). We first note that the branches of the dispersion
relation characterised by the sign of the norm are related via complex
conjugation:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We therefore define @xmath (taking the norm to be positive) and include
the complex conjugates of the resulting plane waves, forming a complete
set of solutions. The normalized plane wave solutions are defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (42.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

Given this definition, the scalar products between modes are given by

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (42.2)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

If we transform back to the lab coordinates @xmath and @xmath (using
Eqs. ( 29.1 ) and ( 29.2 )), the phase of the mode @xmath transforms as

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

so positive-norm modes are those that

-   if @xmath , propagate along the fiber in the forward
    (co-propagating) direction, i.e., they are @xmath -modes;

-   if @xmath , propagate along the fiber in the backward
    (counter-propagating) direction, i.e., they are @xmath -modes.

For negative-norm modes, the sign in front of @xmath is changed, and the
reverse is true.

It would do well to re-emphasise that @xmath is the frequency as
measured in the laboratory , and it is generally not conserved. It
should not be confused with the frequency @xmath as defined in the
context of the acoustic model, which is a genuine Killing frequency.
Rather, the co-moving frequency @xmath is a Killing frequency here,
while @xmath is analogous to the wavevector @xmath in the acoustic
model. So that statement that @xmath -modes with @xmath have positive
norm, despite first appearances, is actually in accordance with the
similar statement made in § 11 .

Expressing the total optical field @xmath as a sum over the individual
modes, and constraining @xmath to be real since it describes a physical
quantity, we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (42.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

with canonical momentum

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (42.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the coefficient functions can be expressed very simply using the
orthonormality conditions of Eqs. ( 42.2 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (42.5)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The optical field is readily quantized: the real-valued quantities
@xmath and @xmath are promoted to the Hermitian operators @xmath and
@xmath , and the coefficients @xmath and @xmath to the Hermitian
conjugate operators @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (42.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (42.7)
  -- -------- -- --------

Imposing the equal time (i.e., equal propagation time, @xmath )
commutation relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (42.8)
  -- -------- -- --------

we find that @xmath and @xmath satisfy the Bose commutation relations

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (42.9)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

#### 43 Transforming to the @xmath-representation

Eqs. ( 42.6 )-( 42.9 ) describe the field in the @xmath -representation,
i.e., the variable used to specify the various field modes is the lab
frequency @xmath . This is fine when @xmath is constant. However, if
@xmath is a function of @xmath , then @xmath is not conserved, and the
field modes defined above are only valid in regions where @xmath is
approximately constant. Even then, these modes do not evolve
independently, but can be transformed into each other by the
inhomogeneous nonlinearity profile. To express the field in terms of
modes which do evolve independently, we must use a representation based
on the conserved co-moving frequency @xmath . (This is analogous to the
transformation from the @xmath - to the @xmath -representation performed
in § 12 .)

##### 43.1 Constant @xmath

We begin by assuming a constant value of @xmath . The dispersion
relation is given by the positive-norm branch of Eq. ( 41.10 ),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (43.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the possible values of @xmath corresponding to a single value of
@xmath are found by plotting these two functions and noting their points
of intersection, as illustrated in Figure 37 .

Since the function @xmath is multi-valued, the transformation from an
integral over @xmath to an integral over @xmath must be split into
several terms, each of which covers a branch over which @xmath is
single-valued. An examination of Fig. 37 shows that there are four such
branches:

-   @xmath , which covers all plane waves that are backward-propagating
    in the lab frame; this is the @xmath -branch;

-   @xmath , where @xmath has the most negative value of the co-moving
    frequency, which we shall call @xmath ; these waves are
    forward-propagating and have a negative-directed (left-moving) group
    velocity in the co-moving frame, and thus make up the @xmath
    -branch;

-   @xmath , where @xmath has zero co-moving frequency; these
    forward-propagating waves have a positive-directed (right-moving)
    group velocity in the co-moving frame, and make up the @xmath
    -branch;

-   @xmath , which covers the remainder of the waves that are
    forward-propagating in the lab frame; this is the remaining @xmath
    -branch.

The integral over all @xmath is a sum of the integrals over each of
these branches:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (43.2)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (43.3)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (43.4)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (43.5)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where we have defined

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (43.6)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

and similarly for the other branches. These definitions ensure that the
newly-defined modes are orthonormal with respect to the co-moving
frequency @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath                     (43.7)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

while the operators obey commutation relations that are now defined with
respect to @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (43.8)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Similar relations hold for the other branches.

Replacing the Hermitian conjugates, the total optical field is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (43.9)
  -- -------- -- --------

A mode with negative @xmath is the Hermitian conjugate of a mode with
positive @xmath , and vice versa. Since any modes with the same
co-moving frequency can be mixed, our final task it to rewrite the
optical field operator such that all modes with the same @xmath are
grouped together, and each value of @xmath appears only once. As
discussed in § 12 , this amounts to rewriting the second term above - an
integral over negative frequencies - as an integral over positive
frequencies:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (43.10)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Finally, the optical field operator can be expressed in the simple form

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (43.11)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where we have defined

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (43.12)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Just as in the acoustic case, the mixing of positive- and negative-norm
modes corresponds to a mixing of annihilation and creation operators.
This mixing, however, is still purely incidental if @xmath is
independent of @xmath , for then @xmath is separately conserved.

##### 43.2 Nonconstant @xmath

Now let @xmath be a nonconstant function of @xmath . As usual, we assume
that @xmath approaches limiting asymptotic values as @xmath ; in
practice, since light pulses are localised, these asymptotic values will
both be zero, but we needn’t make this assumption. Since @xmath is no
longer conserved, the description of the field in the @xmath
-representation given by Eqs. ( 43.11 ) and ( 43.12 ) is now its natural
form. The assignment of branch labels @xmath follows the example set by
the acoustic model in § 12 : we specify two types of modes, labelled in-
and out-modes, which are characterised either by a single incident
frequency scattered into many outgoing frequencies, or many incident
frequencies scattered into a single outgoing frequency; the branch label
applies to this single incident or outgoing frequency. For a graphical
illustration, refer back to Fig. 10 .

Another difference arises if the asymptotic values of @xmath are
distinct. Then the dispersion relation on the right-hand side of Eq. (
43.1 ) is slightly different in each asymptotic region; in particular,
@xmath differs, as shown in Figure 38 . Let us label these different
values as @xmath and @xmath , with @xmath . Then there are three
distinct cases:

-   @xmath : Both values of @xmath have four real solutions for @xmath ,
    and these solutions vary smoothly as @xmath varies. The mode is
    decomposed according to the first line of Eq. ( 43.12 ).

-   @xmath : One value of @xmath has four real solutions for @xmath ,
    while the other has only two. The two that exist for both values of
    @xmath correspond to the @xmath - and @xmath - branches, and these
    vary smoothly as @xmath is varied. The other two solutions
    correspond to the @xmath - and @xmath -branches, and these exist
    only for one asymptotic value of @xmath . As @xmath varies, these
    solutions merge, becoming complex conjugates in the other asymptotic
    region; they thus experience a group-velocity horizon, and, as
    discussed in § 12 , are combined into a single branch, which will be
    labelled the @xmath -branch. The field mode is decomposed similarly
    to the first line of Eq. ( 12.16 ).

-   @xmath : Each value of @xmath has only two real solutions for @xmath
    , which vary smoothly as @xmath varies. These correspond to the
    @xmath - and @xmath -branches, and the mode is expanded in
    accordance with the second line of Eq. ( 43.12 ).

To summarise, the total field remains in the form of Eq. ( 43.11 ), and
the individual modes are now decomposed as follows:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The modes appearing in this decomposition may be in- or out-modes, each
of these forming a complete orthonormal set. (Again, see § 12 .)
Therefore, we have, for @xmath , the identity

  -- -- -- ---------
           (43.13)
  -- -- -- ---------

with similar identities for other values of @xmath .

Since typically @xmath and @xmath are very close in value, we shall
assume in what follows @xmath , so that there is no group-velocity
horizon; for @xmath , the analysis is akin to that of § 12 .
Completeness of the modes ensures that we can express one type of mode
as a linear combination of the other, so we may write

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath            
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The coefficients are equal to scalar products between modes, e.g.,
@xmath and @xmath . Applying the identity @xmath - which follows from
the definition of the scalar product in Eq. ( 41.8 ) - we can express
the out-modes as combinations of in-modes using the same coefficients:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Substitution in Eq. ( 43.13 ) gives the corresponding transformation of
the annihilation and creation operators:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Similarly, the inverse transformation is found:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

As in the acoustic case, this is where the significance of mixing
between positive- and negative-norm modes becomes manifest: a single
operator corresponding to an in- or out-mode, when written in terms of
those operators for the other type of mode, can contain both
annihilation and creation operators.

#### 44 Spontaneous creation of photons

Assuming that the quantum state is the in-vacuum, @xmath , which
contains no incoming particles and is annihilated by all in-mode
annihilation operators, i.e.,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (44.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

we find that the mixing of different types of operator still allows the
presence of outgoing particles. For example, the expectation number for
the outgoing @xmath -mode is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (44.2)
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where the normalization of the state @xmath and the commutator of Eq. (
43.8 ) were used. Similar expressions hold for the expectation values of
the other modes:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (44.3)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (44.4)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (44.5)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

and also for those modes with co-moving frequency such that @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (44.6)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (44.7)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (44.8)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

However, for those modes with co-moving frequency @xmath , there is no
mixing of positive- and negative-norm modes and hence no particle
creation.

The @xmath functions appearing in the expectation values above are due
to the continuous nature of the stationary modes into which the optical
field is decomposed. Arguments entirely analogous to those given in § 13
show that the expectation values should be interpreted, upon division by
@xmath , as spectral flux densities:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (44.9)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the factor multiplying the delta funtions in the
expectation values above. However, this is defined in the co-moving
frame, and requires some modification to be turned into a more useful
quantity, defined with respect to the lab frame. Instead of the
variables @xmath and @xmath , we would like a spectral flux density in
terms of @xmath and @xmath . Firstly, it should be noted that Eq. ( 44.9
) refers to a single pulse; in practice, a stream of pulses are coupled
into the fibre with repetition rate @xmath . So, in order to find the
number of photons emitted per unit time, we first find the number of
photons emitted per pulse, and multiply by @xmath . The number of
photons per pulse is found by integrating with respect to @xmath over
the entire length of the fibre, and assuming that the pulse is a soliton
so that it remains stationary in the co-moving frame, so amounts to
multiplying by @xmath , where @xmath is the length of the fibre and
@xmath is the group velocity of the pulse. Therefore, Eq. ( 44.9 )
becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (44.10)
  -- -------- -- ---------

or, multiplying by @xmath to effect the transformation from variable
@xmath to @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (44.11)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Taking the values from the experiment in Chapter III , @xmath , @xmath
and @xmath where @xmath , we find that @xmath ; loosening these
restrictions slightly, we can say that the transformation from the
co-moving frame to the lab frame roughly preserves the order of
magnitude of the spectral flux density. However, it should be borne in
mind that the actual value depends on the factor @xmath . Of the
quantities appearing there, the most important is @xmath , for in the
derivation we assumed that the pulse maintains its shape throughout the
fibre. However, if instead we make use of self-steepening mechanisms, so
that the pulse shape changes with its propagation, then @xmath should be
replaced by an effective length @xmath , over which the pulse emits
photons most efficiently.

#### 45 Concluding remarks

Having quantized the optical probe field in the presence of a strong
pulse, we have shown, as in the acoustic case, that there are two
natural sets of modes into which the field may be decomposed: in-modes
and out-modes. These sets define two vacuum states, and it is found
that, due to the mixing of modes of positive and negative norm, these
vacuum states are not equal. Thus, in the in-vacuum, which has no
incoming photons, there are outgoing photons, which are emitted
spontaneously by the pulse.

### Chapter \thechapter Methods of Fibre-Optical Model

Having developed the theoretical foundations of our fibre-optical model
of the event horizon, we come now to the methods employed to calculate
the expected spectrum of Hawking radiation. These bear many similarities
to the methods of Chapter II used in the acoustic model. As there, we
examine an FDTD algorithm for wavepacket propagation; an ordinary
differential equation solver and algebraic technique for finding
steady-state solutions; and an analytic method derived from
linearization of the nonlinearity profile.

#### 46 Wavepacket propagation

When discussing methods for solving the acoustic case in § 15 , we began
by following in the spirit of Unruh [ 18 ] , calculating
negative-frequency contributions by solving for the propagation of a
wavepacket directly using an FDTD (Finite Difference Time Domain)
algorithm. The starting point is, of course, the fibre-optical wave
equation ( 41.4 ), which can be decomposed into two PDEs of the first
order in @xmath using (a quantity proportional to) the canonical
momentum @xmath of Eq. ( 41.9 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (46.1)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (46.2)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Notice that Eq. ( 46.2 ) contains a term in @xmath , and is therefore
not purely first-order. The operation of @xmath on @xmath is analogous
to that of @xmath on @xmath in the acoustic model: if @xmath is the
Fourier transform of @xmath with respect to @xmath ,

  -- -- -- --------
           (46.3)
  -- -- -- --------

then the operation of @xmath on @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (46.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Fourier transform is implemented numerically using the FFT (Fast
Fourier Transform) algorithm.

As in § 15 , we convert Eqs. ( 46.1 ) and ( 46.2 ) into finite
difference equations by discretizing the @xmath - and @xmath -axes into
grids, with separations @xmath and @xmath respectively. We also allow
the grids representing values of @xmath and @xmath to be offset by
@xmath . Then Eqs. ( 46.1 ) and ( 46.2 ) become

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Rearranging, we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (46.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (46.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

or, in matrix form,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (46.7)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (46.8)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where we have assumed periodic boundary conditions, identifying @xmath
with @xmath and @xmath with @xmath , and where we have defined

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (46.9)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (46.10)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (46.11)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

The solution follows as before. The vector @xmath is assumed fixed in
@xmath (hence its independence of @xmath ), and determines the
nonlinearity profile; @xmath is its @xmath -derivative, and can be
stored as a separate vector for convenience. Given the vectors @xmath
and @xmath , we can calculate @xmath and solve Eq. ( 46.7 ) for @xmath ,
using the algorithm for cyclic equations from Ref. [ 58 ] ; then, given
the vectors @xmath and @xmath , we can calculate @xmath and solve Eq. (
46.8 ) for @xmath . The only remaining unknowns are the initial values
@xmath and @xmath , which are related via the Fourier Transform as in
Eq. ( 15.9 ) and a half-step finite difference equation similar to Eq. (
15.10 ).

The FDTD algorithm does not run so smoothly for the optical model as for
the acoustic model. One problem is with the dispersion profile, which
naturally increases with frequency, in principle without bound. Allowing
such an unbounded form for @xmath can make the algorthim unstable;
however, this problem is easily solved by applying an appropriate
cut-off frequency, beyond which @xmath is set to zero. A less tractable
problem is that the degree of backscattering, or scattering from @xmath
-modes into @xmath -modes, is greater in the optical model than in the
acoustic model. Although the amount of backscattering in terms of norm
is still small, the amplitude of the wave, which is proportional to
@xmath , is fairly large, since the @xmath -modes occur at very low
frequencies. This makes the above FDTD algorithm of limited value,
especially visually, since this unphysical low-frequency mode quickly
fills up the domain.

#### 47 Steady-state solution

In practice, the spectrum of Hawking radiation is found by finding
steady-state solutions for various values of @xmath , and finding their
negative-norm components. The general nonlinearity profile is solved in
an entirely analogous fashion to the acoustic model (see § 16 ), and
will be discussed only briefly. For the special case of a nonlinearity
profile which in constant apart from step discontinuities, the method is
again analogous to the acoustic model, but the resulting equations are
slightly different and will be discussed in full.

##### 47.1 General nonlinearity profile

Assuming a stationary solution of the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

the optical wave equation ( 41.4 ) is transformed into the ordinary
differential equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (47.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

The order of this equation is the same as the order of @xmath . Assuming
a constant value of @xmath and taking the Fourier transform via the
substitutions @xmath and @xmath , Eq. ( 47.1 ) becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and again we find the dispersion relation of Eqs. ( 29.12 )-( 29.14 ),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (47.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

If @xmath approaches asymptotic values for @xmath , then it can be
approximated as constant in the asymptotic regions, and the dispersion
relation of Eq. ( 47.2 ) will apply. The general solution in each
asymptotic region is a sum of plane waves with frequencies determined by
the dispersion relation, and the plane wave coefficients in each region
are related via a scattering matrix as in Eq. ( 16.4 ). (Refer to Fig.
13 for an illustration.) The in- or out-mode that is to be solved
determines which coefficients to set to zero, and the remaining
coefficients are solved via linear algebra. The modes are normalized in
the @xmath -representation according to Eqs. ( 42.1 ) and ( 43.6 ):

  -- -- -- --------
           (47.3)
  -- -- -- --------

Therefore, if we have the plane wave coefficients, the norm of a
particular plane wave in relation to the single ingoing or outgoing wave
is

  -- -- -- --------
           (47.4)
  -- -- -- --------

##### 47.2 Discontinuous nonlinearity profile

Eq. ( 47.1 ) may be solved analytically in the special case where @xmath
is constant everywhere except at discrete points. This might correspond,
for example, to a square pulse, whose intensity is constant in a certain
region and zero elsewhere. It is of course an idealised case, formed by
taking the limit as the derivative of @xmath increases without bound.

We proceed exactly as in § 16 . We assume that @xmath is a polynomial of
order @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which would result in @xmath solutions of the dispersion relation. In
any region of constant @xmath , the solution is specified by the @xmath
coefficients of the possible plane waves; if there are @xmath regions,
or @xmath points of discontinuity, there are @xmath coefficients in
total. However, there can only be @xmath linearly independent solutions,
which means there must be @xmath conditions on these coefficients, or
@xmath conditions for each point of discontinuity. These relate the
limiting values of @xmath and its first @xmath derivatives on each side
of these points.

Expanding the last term of Eq. ( 47.1 ), and replacing the operator
@xmath with its polynomial expansion, we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (47.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

We see that the steady-state equation contains @xmath and its first
derivative @xmath only, and is therefore almost equivalent to the
acoustic case, which contains the flow velocity @xmath and its first
derivative @xmath only. (The difference here is that @xmath and @xmath
are not multiplied, and the discontinuities in the derivatives of @xmath
can have at most a @xmath dependence, in contrast to the @xmath
dependence in the acoustic model.) We note that a discontinuity in
@xmath must be accompanied by a delta function in @xmath , and that
these can only be cancelled by a discontinuity in @xmath accompanied by
a delta function in @xmath . All other quantities must be continuous.
Therefore, the first @xmath of the @xmath conditions to be imposed at a
point of discontinuity are the continuity of @xmath and its first @xmath
derivatives; the final condition involves imposing the correct
discontinuity on @xmath .

Proceeding as in the acoustic case, we imagine a nonlinearity profile
that varies linearly over a region of length @xmath between two
constant- @xmath regions, and is therefore continuous in @xmath but
discontinuous in @xmath ; the case of discontinuous @xmath is found by
taking the limit @xmath . (See Fig. 15 , replacing @xmath with @xmath .)
A discontinuity in @xmath at the point @xmath must be accompanied by a
corresponding discontinuity in @xmath at @xmath , so that Eq. ( 47.5 )
is always satisfied. We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

or, defining @xmath and similarly for @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (47.6)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where @xmath is to be evaluated at @xmath (this is continuous, so there
is no ambiguity).

To find the change in @xmath over the change in @xmath , we use the
Taylor expansion

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Letting @xmath , the only non-vanishing term is @xmath , and we find
that the discontinuity in @xmath is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (47.7)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is the final condition to be imposed at each point of
discontinuity. We are thus left with @xmath degrees of freedom,
corresponding to the @xmath -dimensional space of solutions, for which
we have the bases of @xmath in-modes or @xmath out-modes.

#### 48 Linearized intensity profile

Using an approach very similar to that used in § 17 , we may derive an
analytic expression for the creation rate. The essential assumption is
that the creation process occurs in a very narrow region around the
horizon, and therefore that we may approximate the intensity profile as
a linear one - just as, in the acoustic case, we approximated the
velocity profile as linear.

Assume a steady-state solution @xmath , which satisfies Eq. ( 47.1 ).
Let the nonlinearity @xmath take the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (48.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

The optical wave equation now becomes first-order in @xmath . Making the
substitutions @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , we find a first-order
differential equation for the Fourier transform:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (48.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

Rearranging, this becomes

  -- -- -- --------
           (48.3)
  -- -- -- --------

The solution is found to be

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (48.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

or

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (48.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is an arbitrary constant. This solution for the Fourier
transform is exact if @xmath is exactly linear. This differs from the
acoustic case, where the WKB approximation was invoked to provide an
approximate solution for the Fourier transform.

In real space, the solution is given by the inverse Fourier transform,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (48.6)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where we have defined

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (48.7)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

As before, this is easily solved using the method of stationary phase:
the main contributions to the integral come from near those points where
@xmath , where we approximate the integral as Gaussian. The stationary
points @xmath are easily found, for they satisfy

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

or, rearranging,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (48.8)
  -- -------- -- --------

That is, the stationary points are exactly those values of @xmath that
solve the dispersion relation, with @xmath given by its value at @xmath
. Around these points, the phase @xmath can be approximated as quadratic
in @xmath , and for this we need the second derivative of @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If @xmath solves the dispersion relation of Eq. ( 48.8 ), then clearly

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Differentiating, we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

or, rearranging,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Substituting into the expression for @xmath above, we find the much
simpler expression

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (48.9)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where @xmath is the group velocity in the co-moving frame. Around the
frequency @xmath , then, @xmath can be approximated by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (48.10)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

The integral in Eq. ( 48.6 ) can now be approximated as

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Note that the factor @xmath is precisely that factor needed to normalize
the plane wave of frequency @xmath . It seems reasonable that the
remaining exponential term, @xmath , becomes just such a plane wave in
the asymptotic region, where @xmath becomes constant. Let us examine
this term; from Eq. ( 48.7 ),

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (48.11)
  -- -------- -- ---------

valid when @xmath . However, if we plug this form of @xmath into the
dispersion relation Eq. ( 48.8 ), we find that we can express @xmath as
a function of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (48.12)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The phase @xmath , then, is simply given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (48.13)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and we generalize the result by allowing @xmath to take an arbitrary
form.

In the form of an integral over @xmath , the simple nature of the phase
is obscured; for, differentiating with respect to @xmath , and bearing
in mind that @xmath itself is a function of @xmath , we find @xmath .
Therefore, @xmath can also be written

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (48.14)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Clearly, in the asymptotic regions, @xmath , and the solution becomes a
sum over the normalized modes. The only way, in this approximation, that
different modes can have different amplitudes is if @xmath has an
imaginary part. The norm, then, of one frequency @xmath relative to
another @xmath is

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (48.15)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

In particular, for photon creation, the relative weight between the
Bogoliubov coefficients is

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (48.16)
  -- -------- -- ---------

#### 49 Summary

The methods described in this chapter are entirely analogous to those
developed in the context of the acoustic model. They are:

-   an FDTD algorithm, for solving wavepacket propagation;

-   numerical integration to find stationary modes; and

-   an analytic approximation for a linearized intensity profile.

Of these, as before, numerical integration of stationary modes is the
most convenient for calculating the Hawking spectra, while the analytic
approximation is useful in pointing the way towards a better analytic
expression.

### Chapter \thechapter Results for the Fibre-Optical Model

We come now to the presentation of the results obtained from solutions
to the fibre-optical wave equation. This is the first such presentation
for the fibre-optical model, although the main results - both old and
new - of Chapter II in the context of the acoustic model are replicated
here. However, when using realistic profiles for the pulse-induced
nonlinearity, we find ourselves in a new regime which not only contains
no low-frequency horizon, but whose spectrum is dominated by a
frequencies which experience no group-velocity horizon. The qualitative
results in this regime are rather different; in particular, we shall see
that the width of the spectrum remains constant in @xmath , the height
of the nonlinearity, but that its value is proportional to @xmath .

#### 50 Dispersion relation

The dispersion is treated as subluminal, so that @xmath increases with
@xmath . (Recall that @xmath is the wavenumber as a function of
frequency; it is essentially the inverse of the function @xmath that was
used in the acoustic model. Subluminal dispersion, then, is expressed as
a decrease in @xmath with @xmath or an increase in @xmath with @xmath .)
As before, the simplest deviation from the dispersionless case is the
introduction of a quartic term in @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (50.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is the first form of the dispersion relation we shall use. It
cannot, of course, capture all the details of any realistic dispersion
relation; indeed, it is characterised by a single parameter, @xmath ,
which determines the scale at which deviations from the dispersionless
case first become appreciable. We could, if we wished, more closely
approximate a certain dispersion profile by adding higher even powers of
@xmath ; but such adjustments increase the complexity of the
calculations - the order of the differential equation is increased, and
usually some of the possible frequencies are complex, which can affect
the accuracy of the numerics - and do not return their worth with
significantly different results. Therefore, we shall not consider them.

It is convenient to express @xmath not in terms of @xmath , but of the
lab frequency with zero co-moving frequency, which we shall call @xmath
. This is defined via the relation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Eq. ( 50.1 ) may now be written:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (50.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

However, even leaving the dispersion relation in this quartic form,
there is still some room for manoeuvre. We shall be especially
interested in the behaviour of high frequencies, around the frequency
@xmath . To find a form of @xmath which models the dispersion around
this frequency well, we wish both that @xmath vanish there and that the
derivative @xmath is equal to a specified value (which may then be
measured). Let @xmath . Matching these two conditions requires two
variable parameters for @xmath , but Eq. ( 50.1 ) has only one: the
parameter @xmath . This is because we have chosen @xmath such that the
phase velocity approaches @xmath for low frequencies. If we require a
better match at high frequencies, we must sacrifice this low-frequency
condition. (There should be no qualms about doing this, for realistic
fibres have a non-trivial refractive index as @xmath , so the
dispersionless limit is unrealistic anyway.) Doing so, we may write
@xmath in the more general form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

then apply the conditions we want satisfied:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --

These are easily solved to give

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Finally, we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (50.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

Comparing Eqs. ( 50.2 ) and ( 50.3 ), we see that the second can be made
equal to the first via the substitution @xmath . Therefore, in what
follows, we shall use the dispersion relation in Eq. ( 50.3 )
exclusively, and without loss of generality. For the purpose of
comparison with the acoustic model, we shall include the case where
@xmath as @xmath , bearing in mind that this is unrealistic. We shall
also look at a more realistic model, whose value of @xmath is determined
by the high-frequency dispersion, near @xmath , of a real fibre.
Therefore, the two cases we shall examine are:

-   @xmath gives @xmath at low frequencies (near @xmath ); and

-   @xmath gives a more realistic @xmath at high frequencies (near
    @xmath ).

Let us also note that a purely subluminal dispersion relation, like
those given above, is incompatible with the alleged existence of optical
solitons in the fibre: as noted in § 28 , solitons are only possible in
regions where @xmath , which is clearly not the case for the above forms
of @xmath . However, the purpose of the soliton - if, indeed, the pulse
is a soliton - is to provide the nonlinear change in refractive index;
its frequency is irrelevant for the purposes of the mode conversion. It
is the dispersion at the modes that are scattered into each other which
is relevant for calculating the Hawking spectrum. Even then, as already
noted, the quartic dispersion cannot be expected to apply to all
frequencies, being only the simplest analytic deviation from the
dispersionless case.

#### 51 Intensity profile

The simplest intensity profile, by direct analogy with the acoustic
model, is the hyperbolic tangent,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (51.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

which varies monotonically between two asymptotic values: @xmath on the
left ( @xmath ) and @xmath on the right ( @xmath ). Another possibility
is the hyperbolic secant profile that would be associated with a
fundamental soliton:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (51.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

Although Eq. ( 51.2 ) describes an intensity profile which is exact for
a fundamental soliton, and in that sense more realistic than Eq. ( 51.1
), there are instances when this relationship might change. In
particular, the phenomenon of self-steepening perturbs a soliton in such
a way that its trailing edge becomes much steeper than its leading edge.
Since radiation rates are strongly dependent on the steepness of the
change in intensity, this single steep edge dominates the process, so
that Eq. ( 51.1 ) becomes more physically relevant than Eq. ( 51.2 ),
whose leading and trailing edges are equally steep.

#### 52 Normalizing the wave equation

We now transform the optical wave equation into a form with as few
parameters as possible. Beginning with the general fiber-optical wave
equation ( 29.7 ),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (52.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

we substitute the quartic form of @xmath given in Eq. ( 50.3 ) to get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (52.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

Transforming to dimensionless variables @xmath and @xmath , this becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (52.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

or

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (52.4)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

If @xmath takes the hyperbolic tangent form of Eq. ( 51.1 ), then @xmath
may be written

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and we see that the normalized optical wave equation contains four
parameters:

-   @xmath and @xmath , the asymptotic values of the intensity-dependent
    nonlinearity;

-   @xmath , a parameter that combines the steepness of the intensity
    profile with the strength of the dispersion; and

-   @xmath , which determines the group velocity in the co-moving frame,
    or, in the lab frame, the speed of the pulse relative to the
    frequency regime in which we are interested.

#### 53 Predicted behaviour for a low-frequency event horizon

In the absence of dispersion, the wave equation ( 52.1 ) takes the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (53.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the group index at the pulse frequency. It is clear that
there is an event horizon for all frequencies at @xmath ; this is
equivalent to the point @xmath in the acoustic case. Even in the
dispersive case, if such a point exists then all forward-propagating,
positive-norm frequencies experience a group-velocity horizon. We expect
the emission of Hawking radiation, which is thermal at low frequencies.

What is the low-frequency temperature of the emitted radiation? In the
non-dispersive acoustic case, by direct analogy with gravitational black
holes, the temperature was found to be proportional to the derivative of
the velocity profile at the horizon. It was then found, by both
numerical simulations and analytic approximations, that this form of the
temperature does not change if the slope is small and the dispersion
weak. Since the mathematical analogy between the optical model and the
acoustic model is not exact, it is not so clear what form the
low-frequency temperature should take, although it should be
approximately proportional to the derivative of @xmath at the event
horizon. Instead, let us make use of the fact that linearizing the
velocity profile in the vicinity of the horizon led in the acoustic
model to an expression for the temperature that is valid in the
low-slope, weak-dispersion regime. We also have such an expression for
the optical model: according to Eq. ( 48.16 ), the predicted Hawking
creation rate is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (53.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (53.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

This requires that @xmath be given as a function of @xmath , which is
done in the same way as for the acoustic case; the result is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (53.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

Restricting our attention to real values of @xmath , the only
contribution to @xmath comes from those values of @xmath that do not
correspond to real values of @xmath . For these frequencies, @xmath , up
to an integer multiple of @xmath . Therefore,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (53.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are frequencies in the asymptotic regions, and
mark the extremities of the real branches of @xmath . (We ignore the
counter-propagating @xmath -modes, whose contribution to the phase
integral is negligible.) Using the relation @xmath , this becomes the
thermal-like spectrum

  -- -- -- --------
           (53.6)
  -- -- -- --------

To first order in @xmath we find

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

so that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For low co-moving frequencies, then, we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the predicted temperature @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (53.7)
  -- -------- -- --------

Analogous with Eq. ( 22.3 ) for the acoustic model, we define a rescaled
energy spectrum

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (53.8)
  -- -------- -- --------

so that, if the spectrum is thermal at low frequencies with temperature
@xmath , then

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (53.9)
  -- -------- -- --------

To see how this is related to the slope of the nonlinearity, let us find
@xmath , where @xmath . We have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and so

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The derivative is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The temperature of Eq. ( 53.7 ), then, is related to the derivative at
the horizon by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (53.10)
  -- -------- -- ---------

If @xmath and @xmath are close to the horizon, i.e., if @xmath , this
reduces to the simple formula

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (53.11)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This prediction agrees with that of Eq. ( 41.7 ), which was derived from
the approximate description of the pulse/probe system as a spacetime
geometry.

Eq. ( 53.10 ) suggests that the temperature increases without bound as
the derivative of the nonlinearity does. However, we have seen that, in
the presence of dispersion, the solutions of the wave equation are
well-behaved in the limit @xmath . Eqs. ( 53.7 ) and ( 53.10 ) are valid
only in the low- @xmath limit; in the high- @xmath limit, the
temperature is determined by solving the discontinuous nonlinearity
profile. Therefore, as @xmath increases, the temperature becomes
independent of @xmath by approaching a limit. This limiting case is
solved in Appendix IV ; the resulting low-frequency temperature is

  -- -- -- ---------
           (53.12)
  -- -- -- ---------

Comparing Eqs. ( 53.7 ) and ( 53.12 ), we find that the low- @xmath and
high- @xmath forms of the temperature agree if we take

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and it is expected that the transition from one regime to the other
occurs when @xmath is comparable to this value.

#### 54 Numerical results

##### 54.1 With a low-frequency horizon

We begin, as in the acoustic case, with the case where an event horizon
for low frequencies is present. In the optical case, this occurs at
@xmath .

We have seen in Eq. ( 53.7 ) that the low-frequency temperature is
predicted to be proportional to @xmath when @xmath is sufficiently
small; we have also seen, in Eq. ( 53.12 ), that this temperature
approaches a limiting value as @xmath . This is exactly as was found in
the acoustic model, where we were able to fit the resulting temperatures
to a hyperbolic tangent curve (see Fig. 25 ). Since the nonlinearity
profile we use here is also a hyperbolic tangent, it is natural to guess
that the temperature assumes a similar form. We have already seen, in §
25 , that there are two possibilities:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (54.1)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Both of these are plotted in Figure 39 , along with results of the
optical case with various values of the parameters @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath . Once again, we find that the second of Eqs. ( 54.1 ) agrees
remarkably well with the numerical results, clearly much more so than
the first equation. Substituting Eqs. ( 53.7 ) and ( 53.12 ), we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (54.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is also found that, if the parameters @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are
chosen such that @xmath , then the resulting spectra agree very well
with the phase integral prediction of Eq. ( 53.6 ). Figure 40 shows
several such spectra, together with the predicted spectra and a purely
thermal spectrum. Again we find, as in the acoustic case, that the
resulting spectrum is closest to thermal when the horizon - the point
where @xmath - is at the midpoint of the variation. Strikingly, if the
middle value @xmath is decreased, so that the event horizon is moved
towards the far side of the variation, then the high-frequency end of
the spectrum is enhanced in comparison to thermality.

##### 54.2 With realistic values of @xmath

Thermal emission from a horizon where @xmath , though interesting and
useful in constructing the analogy between the fibre-optical model and
the more conventional acoustic model, is very difficult to set up in
practice. A typical group index in glass is @xmath , so that this
horizon occurs at @xmath . However, for femtosecond pulses, the peak
value of @xmath is typically less than @xmath . Can we still expect the
emission of a measurable Hawking spectrum for such modest values of
@xmath ?

In a real fibre, of course, @xmath everywhere except in the vicinity of
the light pulse. This is realisable mathematically if we assume a
fundamental soliton, so that @xmath is of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (54.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are parameters determining the height and width,
respectively, of the soliton. However, self-steepening [ 63 ] perturbs
the pulse such that its trailing edge is much steeper than its leading
edge, so that the trailing edge dominates (see Figure 41 ). In this
case, we can focus solely on the trailing edge of the pulse by using the
hyperbolic tangent profile and setting @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (54.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

Again, @xmath determines the height of the profile, while @xmath
determines the “width” or length of the transition region. In both Eqs.
( 54.3 ) and ( 54.4 ), the length of the transition region, where @xmath
varies between @xmath and @xmath , is given approximately by @xmath ;
due to the normalization of § 52 , @xmath means that the transition
occurs over about one cycle of the frequency @xmath , a steepness in
intensity which is achievable using few-cycle pulses [ 81 , 82 ] . (This
correspondence between the two profiles explains the appearance of the
factor of @xmath in Eq. ( 54.3 ).) It should be borne in mind that the
soliton form of Eq. ( 54.3 ) has two such variations, one increasing and
one decreasing.

Although the evolution of a pulse undergoing self-steepening is
complicated, it is clear that the asymptotic values of @xmath are always
zero. This is clearly not the case for Eq. ( 54.4 ), where @xmath as
@xmath . We can compensate for this by adding another term to @xmath as
follows:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (54.5)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where @xmath and @xmath . This supplies a drop in @xmath from @xmath to
zero as we approach negative @xmath , and the low value of @xmath
ensures that the steepness of this leading edge is less than the
steepness of the trailing edge, still characterised by @xmath . The main
purpose of this form of @xmath is to examine the effects of setting both
asymptotic values of @xmath to zero, and hence to check the validity of
the results obtained using the form of Eq. ( 54.4 ).

Figures 42 and 43 show some results obtained using these more reasonable
values of @xmath . These compare both the use of the soliton (Eq. ( 54.3
)) and hyperbolic tangent (Eq. ( 54.4 )) forms of the nonlinearity, and
the use of the different values of @xmath given in § 50 , which
correspond to @xmath at low frequencies ( @xmath ) and the more
realistic case which is accurate near @xmath ( @xmath ). In Fig. 42 ,
@xmath is fixed while spectra for different values of @xmath are
plotted; in Fig. 43 , @xmath is fixed while @xmath is varied.

There are several points to note about these results:

-   There is no @xmath singularity at low frequencies, so the spectra
    are not thermal even in the low-frequency regime.

-   There is a sharp, narrow peak near the maximum lab frequency, whose
    co-moving frequency is @xmath . At the same time, there is a sharp,
    narrow dip at the group-velocity-matched frequency, whose co-moving
    frequency is also @xmath . This is because, while the photon
    creation rate increases at these co-moving frequencies, they are
    spread over a relatively large frequency band in the lab frame.

-   The hyperbolic tangent nonlinearity profile creates a sharp peak on
    the high-frequency side of the sharp dip. This is smoothed out if a
    soliton-type nonlinearity is used.

-   The soliton profile gives lower spectra than the hyperbolic tangent
    profile for low values of @xmath , but climbs to higher spectra for
    higher values of @xmath .

-   Setting the parameter @xmath to @xmath gives a higher creation rate
    than is obtained when @xmath .

-   For the most part, the spectra are very nearly proportional to
    @xmath . The only regions where this proportionality does not hold
    are where the co-moving frequency is at its maximum, i.e., near the
    group-velocity-matching frequency and its negative-norm counterpart.
    This makes sense: as @xmath increases, so the range of frequencies
    which experience a group-velocity horizon (the capture range )
    widens, and the peak and dip at these frequencies will also widen.

-   For large @xmath the spectra approach limiting curves, as expected.
    For low @xmath , they are highly sensitive to its value. If the
    change in @xmath takes place over more than about one cycle of the
    frequency @xmath , then it is by far the low co-moving frequencies
    that dominate the spectra, reaching heights greater than the narrow
    peak at the maximum frequency. What is more, the coupling between
    the low-frequency @xmath -modes and the high-frequency @xmath -modes
    vastly outweighs the coupling between the @xmath - and @xmath
    -modes. As @xmath increases, however, the whole spectrum increases
    exponentially and the low-frequency peak is smoothed out.

The asymmetric hyperbolic tangent profile produces Hawking spectra very
similar to those for the pure hyperbolic tangent. The main difference
lies in the region around the group-velocity-matching frequency: the
sharp peak on the high-frequency side is smoothed, but unlike for the
soliton profile, this peak clearly still exists.

It should be borne in mind that the calculated spectra, which are photon
flux densities according to Eq. ( 44.9 ), are dimensionless quantities.
In order to yield a measurable quantity, we must replace the factor of
@xmath that was factored out in § 52 . Typically, @xmath lies in the
ultraviolet regime at about @xmath or @xmath . Integrated over the range
of @xmath , a constant value of @xmath for @xmath corresponds roughly to
one emitted photon per second. This must then be modified by the factor
@xmath appearing in Eq. ( 44.11 ), which takes account of repeated
pulses and propagation length. This can vary from about unity for a
soliton in a metre-long fibre down to about @xmath for short pulses or
effective propagation lengths. So Figure 42 , where the intensity change
occurs over a single cycle of the frequency @xmath and the height of the
nonlinearity is on the order of @xmath , yields results ranging from
less than a photon per minute to thousands of photons per second.

Remarkably, these spectra are still fairly well-approximated by analytic
expressions analogous to those found in the acoustic model. As was the
case there, some modification is required: it is found that, rather than
simply a single exponential, the spectrum is formed from a linear
combination of exponentials. For instance, when we have a group-velocity
horizon (which occurs in the tail of the @xmath - @xmath spectrum, near
@xmath ), the spectrum is not given by Eq. ( 53.5 ) but is much better
approximated by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (54.6)
  -- -------- -- --------

Similarly, we find, when there is no group-velocity horizon, that the
@xmath - @xmath and @xmath - @xmath spectra are approximately given by
the following:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (54.7)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (54.8)
  -- -------- -- --------

These expressions are compared with numerical results in Figure 44 .
Note that agreement is good for lower values of @xmath ( @xmath ), but
not for higher values, where the linearization of @xmath performed in §
48 becomes invalid and the spectrum approaches that obtained from a
discontinuous nonlinearity profile.

#### 55 Concluding remarks

We have found, perhaps surprisingly, that Hawking radiation is not only
predicted by the optical model, but it is also subject to the same
observations made in the context of the acoustic model. When an event
horizon is present, the spectrum is thermal at low frequencies, and the
temperature is given by Eq. ( 54.2 ) - a direct analogy of Eq. ( 25.7 )
found for the acoustic case. The spectra deviate from thermality at
higher frequencies, but are well-approximated by the phase-integral
approximation. When there is no low-frequency horizon - the more
realistic case - the spectra are no longer thermal but are
well-approximated by a modified version of the phase-integral
approximation which linearly combines different values of the phase
integral; these are given in Eqs. ( 54.6 )-( 54.8 ). In particular, with
small values of the step size @xmath , the spectra (or those parts of
the spectra not subject to a group-velocity horizon) are proportional to
@xmath .

While these results look promising, it is worth examining a serious
criticism of the optical model. This has to do with the validity of the
low-frequency @xmath -modes, and is the subject of the next chapter.

### Chapter \thechapter The Low-Frequency Problem

In solving the complete optical wave equation, we have seen in Chapter
III that, upon quantization of the optical field, spontaneous creation
of photon pairs of vastly different frequencies occurs. Numerical
simulations robustly conclude that the dominant pairing is between the
very high frequencies of the @xmath -mode and the very low frequencies
of the @xmath -mode. This poses a problem unique to the optical model,
to do with the strength of the nonlinear coupling between probe light
and the pulse. In the acoustic model, the spontaneous creation of phonon
pairs with wavenumbers of different orders of magnitude is perfectly
plausible, provided the dispersion relation is valid in both regimes.
These wavenumbers, however different, will “see” the same flow velocity
profile, which is externally fixed - a property of the medium rather
than the waves. In the optical model, the refractive index change
induced by a pulse can be written as @xmath [ 63 ] . (The factor of
@xmath appears because the pulse and probe are assumed to have different
frequencies, so that they interact through cross-phase modulation; see
Eq. ( 28.12 ).) @xmath is the intensity of the pulse, and can be
considered as externally fixed since it is independent of the probe
waves. @xmath , however, is a frequency-dependent quantity: @xmath ,
where @xmath is the frequency of the probe. Frequencies of a similar
order of magnitude - such as the @xmath - and @xmath -modes around the
point where @xmath - will have similar values of @xmath , and the
refractive index change can be assumed identical for such frequencies.
This assumption is invalid for frequencies of different orders of
magnitude. Indeed, there should be virtually no nonlinear coupling at
very low frequencies - precisely those frequencies which, as seen in
Fig. 42 , turn out to dominate the Hawking radiation!

How can we modify our model in order to suppress the low frequencies,
leaving the @xmath - and @xmath -modes as the dominant Hawking pairs?

#### 56 Frequency-dependent @xmath

A first modification is to introduce an explicit frequency-dependence
into the form of @xmath .

##### 56.1 Quadratic dependence on @xmath

We assume that @xmath can be written as the product

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (56.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

so that the frequency @xmath “sees” the nonlinearity profile @xmath .
@xmath is assumed to be the valid form of the nonlinearity when @xmath
is near @xmath , the frequency with vanishing co-moving frequency.;
therefore, @xmath . To make the nonlinearity vanish at low frequencies,
we take @xmath . Since the frequencies @xmath and @xmath must “see”
identical nonlinearities, @xmath must be an even function, and hence we
find that the simplest form of @xmath is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (56.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is a highly artificial construction, but it should help to
eliminate the unrealistic frequencies and give some indication of what
the Hawking spectrum might look like in practice.

To implement Eqs. ( 56.1 ) and ( 56.2 ), we replace @xmath by the
operator @xmath and substitute into the optical wave equation. However,
the arrangement of the two new differential operators must be chosen
with care. This is done in such a way that the scalar product of Eq. (
41.8 ) remains constant with respect to @xmath ; upon the taking of this
derivative, and the substitution of the wave equation in the resulting
integrand, we may use integration by parts to obtain cancelling terms
only when the derivative operators @xmath are placed symmetrically
around @xmath . Therefore, the new wave equation is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (56.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

Plugging in the quartic form of the dispersion in Eq. ( 50.3 ) and
normalizing the wave equation according to Eq. ( 52.3 ), this becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (56.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

##### 56.2 Results

Eq. ( 56.4 ) can be solved numerically as before. We assume a hyperbolic
tangent nonlinearity profile:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (56.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

We also assume that the contributions from the @xmath -mode are
negligible, so that the @xmath -mode pairs only with the @xmath - and
@xmath -modes. Then, we may use the method of § 47 to numerically solve
for the @xmath -in mode, and the norms of the @xmath - and @xmath -out
modes are interpreted as the spectral amplitudes @xmath and @xmath ; the
spectrum of the @xmath -mode is @xmath .

Figure 45 shows some spectra obtained with this model. We see that the
contribution from the low-frequency modes has indeed been greatly
diminished, although there is still a significant contribution from the
@xmath -mode when the frequency is not too close to zero. Other than
this reduction, the spectra are almost identical with their counterparts
when @xmath is independent of frequency, and if @xmath is low then the
low-frequency component of the radiation remains the dominant one.

Also worthy of note is that the analytic expressions of Eqs. ( 54.6 )-(
54.8 ), which were previously found to be in good agreement with
numerics, remain valid here. The plots are compared in Figure 46 .

#### 57 Reduction to two solutions

Discarding the low-frequency solutions of the dispersion relation (i.e.,
the @xmath - and @xmath -modes), we are left with only two solutions:
the @xmath - and @xmath -modes, lying on either side of the frequency
@xmath whose co-moving frequency vanishes. Although we attempted, in the
previous section, to suppress the low-frequency modes, we found that
they tend to remain the dominant component of the radiation. We would
like to find a way to eliminate them entirely, such that the
high-frequency modes are really the only solutions, to check the
robustness of the Hawking spectrum with respect to the presence or
absence of the low-frequency modes.

There is, however, an immediate problem: the full optical wave equation
has exactly two solutions in the absence of dispersion. Introducing
dispersion - and giving the wavenumber @xmath a more complicated
dependence on @xmath than mere proportionality - serves to increase the
number of solutions. Therefore, we cannot reduce the number of solutions
sufficiently using the full wave equation. Instead, we may formulate a
“half” wave equation that describes purely forward-propagating waves.
This is not easily derived from the optical wave equation ( 41.4 ), but
an analogous equation is derived from the acoustic wave equation ( 9.4
), which is factorizable into forward- and backward-propagating
components. Our first task, then, is to alter the optical wave equation
slightly so that it can be cast in the same form as the acoustic wave
equation.

##### 57.1 Analogy between acoustic and optical wave equations

The acoustic wave equation, fully expanded and in as general a form as
possible, is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (57.1)
  -- -------- -- --------

Similarly for the optical wave equation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (57.2)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the group index of the pulse. It is clear that @xmath
and @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , and @xmath and @xmath are pairs of
analogous quantities. The terms @xmath and @xmath are also analogous.
(The sign of the differential operator is irrelevant since both @xmath
and @xmath are even functions of their arguments.) Also, the
low-frequency wave velocity, usually denoted @xmath in the acoustic
model, corresponds to @xmath in the optical model. The term @xmath is
clearly analogous to the term @xmath , so that the flow velocity @xmath
- which, we recall, is usually taken to be negative - corresponds, in
the optical model, to @xmath . To first order in @xmath , then, the term
@xmath corresponds to the term @xmath . The terms @xmath would, to first
order in @xmath , correspond to @xmath . Neglecting the latter two
terms, the correspondence between the acoustic and optical wave
equations is complete. We conclude that, if we may neglect the terms
@xmath , then we may write the optical wave equation as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (57.3)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have defined

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (57.4)
  -- -------- -- --------

Substituting the differential operators @xmath and @xmath for @xmath and
@xmath , respectively, Eq. ( 57.3 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (57.5)
  -- -------- -- --------

##### 57.2 “Half” wave equation

When @xmath is constant, the wave equation can be Fourier transformed to
give the dispersion relation

  -- -- -- --------
           (57.6)
  -- -- -- --------

In the absence of pulses, or far away from them, @xmath , so from Eq. (
57.4 ) we have @xmath and Eq. ( 57.6 ) becomes @xmath , where the minus
sign corresponds to forward-propagating waves. Singling out the
forward-propagating waves can be achieved by replacing Eq. ( 57.5 ) with
its “square root”:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (57.7)
  -- -------- -- --------

or, replacing the differential operators,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (57.8)
  -- -------- -- --------

When @xmath is not constant in @xmath , Eq. ( 57.8 ) does not give an
exact solution of Eq. ( 57.3 ), and the norm is no longer conserved.
However, the differences from the full wave equation might be small
enough so that Eq. ( 57.8 ) can still give meaningful results.

##### 57.3 Dispersion relation

The only remaining task to be done before using the “half” wave equation
is to specify the form of @xmath that gives only two solutions. This can
be derived quite simply as follows. When @xmath is constant, the
dispersion relation is @xmath . In order to have only two solutions for
@xmath , this equation must be quadratic in @xmath , and since it
already contains @xmath to the powers of @xmath and @xmath , it follows
that @xmath must contain either a term in @xmath or a term in @xmath
(possibly alongside terms in @xmath and @xmath ). Since @xmath must be
an odd function, it follows that its general form is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (57.9)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the absence of pulses, or far away from them, the dispersion relation
becomes

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (57.10)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Another requirement is that the co-moving frequency @xmath should vanish
at the frequency @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Eq. ( 57.9 ) can now be written

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (57.11)
  -- -------- -- ---------

How is @xmath to be interpreted? Since the dispersion relation should be
most accurate near @xmath , it is related to the parameter @xmath .
Substituting for @xmath in Eq. ( 57.10 ), we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (57.12)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and, therefore,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (57.13)
  -- -------- -- ---------

When @xmath , this gives @xmath . Substituting in Eqs. ( 57.11 ) and (
57.12 ), we finally have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (57.14)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (57.15)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The artificiality of this dispersion model yields some peculiar
properties. One of these has to do with the signs of first- and
second-order dispersion (i.e., the first and second derivatives of
@xmath ). First-order dispersion is equal to the reciprocal of the
lab-frame group velocity [ 63 ] . Usually, this is positive: in the lab
frame, the phase and group velocities almost always point in the same
direction. This corresponds, in the above model, to a positive value of
@xmath , for

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The second-order dispersion is also usually positive, but there can
exist regimes in which it is negative. (Solitons, for example, can exist
only in regions with negative second-order dispersion, as mentioned in §
28 .) In our case, both first- and second-order dispersion are positive
in the high-frequency regime. However, the second-order dispersion is
given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Although in reality both are positive, the dispersion model we have
selected forces first- and second-order dispersion to have opposite
signs. Figures 47 and 48 show the dispersion relations corresponding to
positive and negative @xmath , respectively. We may still use this
model, so long as we recognise that it is only for the sake of
verification that it is being used, and is by no means accurate,
especially far from the frequency @xmath .

##### 57.4 Numerical results

Some spectra obtained with the dispersion model of Eq. ( 57.14 ) are
plotted in Fig. 49 . Since this model applies only to frequencies near
@xmath , we have taken @xmath in accordance with § 50 . Due to the
ambiguity in the sign of @xmath noted above, we have plotted the results
for both positive and negative @xmath ; note that the change in sign
makes little difference to the results.

One striking feature of the spectra is their width: they are very broad,
reaching frequencies much higher than that obtained by previous spectra.
This is because the dispersion model of Eqs. ( 57.14 ) and ( 57.15 )
does not have a group-velocity horizon for forward-propagating waves,
and therefore has no cut-off frequency. However, the resulting spectra
behave in a similar way to our previous results as the parameters @xmath
and @xmath are varied. The spectra are almost exactly proportional to
@xmath , and since there is no group-velocity horizon, there is no
exception to this rule. Somewhat counter-intuitively, it is @xmath , not
@xmath , which determines the width of the spectra, and for lower values
of @xmath the height increases exponentially with @xmath . As @xmath
increases further, we find that the spectrum tends to a limiting curve,
as expected.

Comparing the results directly with those for quartic dispersion (see
Figure 50 ), we see that, around the frequency @xmath ( @xmath ), the
spectra are of roughly the same order of magnitude. This concordance is
seen more clearly if we simply remove the @xmath -contribution to the
@xmath -modes in the case of quartic dispersion, focusing solely on the
coupling between the @xmath - and the @xmath -modes. That this order of
magnitude is reproduced even approximately when the low-frequency modes
are rendered impossible shows that they have little influence on the
@xmath - @xmath coupling. It would seem that, even if we must take
account of them to solve the wave equation, we are justified in simply
ignoring their contribution to the creation rate.

Again, we may strive for an analytic expression describing the Hawking
spectra, and for this we may turn to the results of previous models for
inspiration. It is found, for low values of @xmath , that the spectra
are well-approximated by the formula

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (57.16)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Several spectra, together with curves given by Eq. ( 57.16 ), are
plotted in Fig. 51 .

#### 58 Concluding remarks

The most important result of this chapter is the observation that, upon
suppression of the low-frequency @xmath -modes, the spectra of the
@xmath -modes are to a large extent preserved. Thus, while many of the
spectra of Chapter III - particularly those for low values of @xmath -
are dominated by @xmath -modes, we are justified in simply ignoring
these, focusing instead only on the @xmath - @xmath pair. This may be
weaker, but it is non-zero, and it may be very significant for higher
values of @xmath . The Hawking spectrum, though diminished, survives.

## Part IV Appendices

### Chapter \thechapter Low-Frequency Temperature in Acoustic Model

In this appendix, we derive the result of Eq. ( 22.7 ), which gives the
low-frequency Hawking temperature in the limit of a discontinuous flow
velocity profile with subluminal quartic dispersion; the normalized
dispersion relation is

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (.1)
  -- -------- -- ------

and the flow velocity profile is

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (.2)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath and @xmath . This velocity profile is shown in Figure 18 ,
and corresponds to a black hole horizon.

The mode to be calculated is the @xmath -out mode, illustrated in Figure
52 . Since we neglect the coupling to @xmath -modes, the only pair
produced is @xmath , and since we have a black hole horizon, @xmath must
be the outgoing wavevector. The creation rate is determined by the norm
of the ingoing @xmath wavevector.

Given the values of @xmath , the coefficients are found by imposing
continuity of @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , and the condition of Eq. (
16.14 ) for @xmath , at @xmath . Eq. ( 16.14 ) gives

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (.3)
  -- -------- -- ------

@xmath is expressed as a sum of the plane wave solutions in each region:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (.4)
  -- -------- -- ------

The conditions given above can then be expressed in matrix form as
follows:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (.5)
  -- -------- -- ------

The solution to this linear equation is

  -- -- -- ------
           (.6)
  -- -- -- ------

In accordance with Eq. ( 16.6 ), the relative negative-norm component is

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (.7)
  -- -------- -- ------

At low frequencies, we should have @xmath , where @xmath is the
temperature of the radiation. (The subscript indicates that this is the
limiting temperature as the steepness of the velocity profile becomes
infinite.) Our task now, then, is to express the quantities in Eq. ( .7
) to lowest order in @xmath . This requires expressions for the five
possible values of @xmath - @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
- to lowest order in @xmath .

For a constant flow velocity @xmath , the solutions for @xmath satisfy
the dispersion relation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

or, rearranging,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (.8)
  -- -------- -- ------

Expressing @xmath as a Taylor series in @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and plugging this series into Eq. ( .8 ), we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For the series on the left of this equation to be identically zero
requires that the coefficient of each power of @xmath is equal to zero:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (.9)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (.10)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (.11)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

and so on. From Eq. ( .9 ), we find that either @xmath or @xmath . (If
@xmath , then @xmath .) If @xmath , Eq. ( .10 ) tells us nothing new,
and so we must fall on Eq. ( .11 ); this reduces to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

a quadratic equation easily solved for @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

On the other hand, if @xmath (and @xmath ), then Eq. ( .10 ) reduces to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

To first order in @xmath , then, we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (.12)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (.13)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (.14)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (.15)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (.16)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Note that, in Eq. ( .16 ), we have taken the imaginary part of @xmath as
negative in order to make it a decreasing exponential for negative
@xmath .

From Eq. ( .6 ), we see that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Plugging in the expansions of Eqs. ( .12 )-( .16 ), we find that, to
lowest order, @xmath is a constant,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and, therefore,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (.17)
  -- -------- -- -------

We must multiply this by @xmath . Now, @xmath and @xmath . Therefore,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and so

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

Pluggin in the expansions of Eqs. ( .13 ) and ( .15 ), we find that, to
lowest order,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (.18)
  -- -------- -- -------

Combining Eqs. ( .17 ) and ( .18 ),

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (.19)
  -- -------- -- -------

whence we may read off the low-frequency temperature, in accordance with
Eq. ( 22.7 ):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (.20)
  -- -------- -- -------

### Chapter \thechapter Low-Frequency Temperature in Optical Model

We now perform an analogous derivation for the optical model. We assume
a discontinuous nonlinearity profile with quartic subluminal dispersion;
the normalized dispersion relation is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (.21)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the nonlinearity profile by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (.22)
  -- -------- -- -------

The mode to be solved is the @xmath -out mode, shown in Figure 53 ,
which has a single decreasing exponential for positive @xmath . Ignoring
the @xmath -mode contribution, the only possible pairing is @xmath , and
since we have a black hole horizon, @xmath is an outgoing frequency. The
creation rate is found via the norm of the ingoing negative-norm wave
with frequency @xmath .

Given the solutions @xmath of the dispersion relation, the coefficients
of the various plane waves are found by imposing the conditions that
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath be continuous at @xmath , and that @xmath has
a discontinuity given by Eq. ( 47.7 ):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (.23)
  -- -------- -- -------

@xmath is expressed as a sum of the possible plane waves in each region:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (.24)
  -- -------- -- -------

The conditions at @xmath can be expressed in matrix form as follows:

  -- -- -- -------
           (.25)
  -- -- -- -------

This has the solution

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (.26)
  -- -------- -- -------

The Bogoliubov coefficient that describes particle creation is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

At low co-moving frequencies @xmath , this should be given approximately
by @xmath , where @xmath is the low-frequency temperature. (Again, the
subscript indicates that the steepness of the nonlinearity profile has
become infinite.) To find this, we need to express the quantities
involved - namely, the frequencies @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath - to lowest order in @xmath .

For a given co-moving frequency @xmath and constant nonlinearity @xmath
, the possible lab frequencies satisfy the dispersion relation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

or, rearranging,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (.27)
  -- -------- -- -------

We express @xmath as a Taylor series in @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and plugging into Eq. ( .27 ) we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For this to be identically zero, the coefficient of each power of @xmath
must be equal to zero. Therefore, we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (.28)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (.29)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (.30)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

and so on. From Eq. ( .28 ), we find @xmath or @xmath . (If @xmath ,
then @xmath .) If @xmath , then Eq. ( .29 ) is trivial, and Eq. ( .30 )
becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This is easily solved to give

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

On the other hand, if @xmath , then Eq. ( .29 ) becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Therefore, to first order in @xmath , we have

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (.31)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (.32)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (.33)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (.34)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (.35)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

As before, we have given @xmath a negative imaginary part so that it
represents a decreasing exponential.

From Eq. ( .26 ) we find

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and, substituting Eqs. ( .31 )-( .35 ) in this expression, we find that,
to lowest order, @xmath has the constant value

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

therefore,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (.36)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

We now turn to the factor @xmath . Using @xmath and
@xmath , we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and so

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Substituting the first-order Taylor expansions of Eqs. ( .32 ) and ( .34
), we find, to lowest order,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (.37)
  -- -------- -- -------

Combining Eqs. ( .36 ) and ( .37 ), we find

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (.38)
  -- -------- -- -------

from which we read off the temperature
