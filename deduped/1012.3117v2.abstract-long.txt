In the repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma, when every player has a different
discount factor, the grim-trigger strategy is an equilibrium if and only
if the discount factor of each player is higher than some threshold.
What happens if the players have incomplete information regarding the
discount factors? In this work we look at repeated games in which each
player has incomplete information regarding the other player’s discount
factor, and ask when a pair of grim-trigger strategies is an
equilibrium. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for such
strategies to be an equilibrium. We characterize the states of the world
in which the strategies are not triggered, i.e., the players cooperate,
in such equilibria (or @xmath -equilibria), and ask whether these
“cooperation events” are close to those in the complete information
case, when the information is “almost” complete, in several senses.
