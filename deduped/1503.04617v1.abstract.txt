In this thesis, we consider domino tilings of three-dimensional regions,
especially those of the form $\mathcal{D} \times [0,N]$. In particular, we
investigate the connected components of the space of tilings of such regions by
flips, the local move performed by removing two adjacent dominoes and placing
them back in the only other possible position. For regions of the form
$\mathcal{D} \times [0,2]$, we define a polynomial invariant $P_t(q)$ that
characterizes tilings that are "almost in the same connected component", in a
sense discussed in the thesis. We also prove that the space of domino tilings
of such a region is connected by flips and trits, a local move performed by
removing three adjacent dominoes, no two of them parallel, and placing them
back in the only other possible position. For the general case, the invariant
is an integer, the twist, to which we give a simple combinatorial formula and
an interpretation via knot theory; we also prove that the twist has additive
properties for suitable decompositions of a region. Finally, we investigate the
range of possible values for the twist of tilings of an $L \times M \times N$
box.
