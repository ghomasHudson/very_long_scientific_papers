### Introduction

  The thesis is divided in two parts. The first is based on the results
  obtained in [ MP2 , MP3 , Po ] and further improvements that give the
  title to the thesis. The following introduction is dedicated only to
  this part.
  The second part, entitled “Other works”, contains a couple of papers,
  as they were published. The first are the lecture notes [ CP ] to
  which the author of this thesis collaborated. They have several points
  of contact with the first part. The second ( [ MP1 ] ) is an article
  on a different topic, published during my studies as a PhD student.

The pioneering symmetry results obtained by A. D. Alexandrov [ Al1 ] , [
Al2 ] and J. Serrin [ Se ] are now classical but still influential. The
former – the well-known Soap Bubble Theorem – states that a compact
hypersurface, embedded in @xmath , that has constant mean curvature must
be a sphere. The latter – Serrin’s symmetry result – has to do with
certain overdetermined problems for partial differential equations. In
its simplest formulation, it states that the overdetermined boundary
value problem

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (1)
     @xmath      (2)
  -- -------- -- -----

admits a solution for some positive constant @xmath if and only if
@xmath is a ball of radius @xmath and, up to translations, @xmath .
Here, @xmath denotes a bounded domain in @xmath , @xmath , with
sufficiently smooth boundary @xmath , say @xmath , and @xmath is the
outward normal derivative of @xmath on @xmath . This result inaugurated
a new and fruitful field in mathematical research at the confluence of
Analysis and Geometry.

Both problems have many applications to other areas of mathematics and
natural sciences. In fact (see the next section), Alexandrov’s theorem
is related with soap bubbles and the classical isoperimetric problem,
while Serrin’s result – as Serrin himself explains in [ Se ] – was
actually motivated by two concrete problems in mathematical physics
regarding the torsion of a straight solid bar and the tangential stress
of a fluid on the walls of a rectilinear pipe.

Some motivations. Let us consider a free soap bubble in the space, that
is a closed surface @xmath in @xmath made of a soap film enclosing a
domain @xmath (made of air) of fixed volume. It is known that (see [ Ro2
] ) if the surface is in equilibrium then it must be a minimizing
minimal surface (in the terminology of Chapter 2 ). This means that its
area within any compact region increases when the surface is perturbed
within that region. Thus, soap bubbles solve the classical isoperimetric
problem, that asks which sets @xmath in @xmath (if they exist) minimize
the surface area for a given volume. Put in other terms, soap bubbles
attain the sign of equality in the classical isoperimetric inequality.
Hence, they must be spheres (see also Theorem 2.50 ).

A standard proof of the isoperimetric inequality that hinges on
rearrangement techniques can be found in [ PS , Section 1.12] . Here, we
just want to underline the relation between the isoperimetric problem
and Alexandrov’s theorem.

In this introduction, we adopt the terminology and techniques pertaining
to shape derivatives , which will later be useful also to give a
motivation to Serrin’s problem. See Chapter 2 , for a more general
treatment pertaining the theory of minimal surfaces.

Thus, we assume the existence of a set @xmath whose boundary @xmath (of
class @xmath ) minimizes its surface area among sets of given volume.
Then, we consider the family of domains @xmath such that @xmath , where

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (3)
  -- -------- -- -----

and @xmath is a mapping such that

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (4)
  -- -------- -- -----

Here, the symbol @xmath means differentiation with respect to @xmath ,
@xmath is any compactly supported continuous function, and @xmath is a
proper extension of the unit normal vector field to a tubular
neighborhood of @xmath .

Thus, we consider the area and volume functionals (in the variable
@xmath )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the boundary of @xmath , and @xmath , @xmath denote
indifferently the @xmath -dimensional measure of @xmath and the @xmath
-dimensional measure of @xmath .

Since @xmath is the domain that minimizes @xmath among all the domains
in the one-parameter family @xmath that have prescribed volume @xmath ,
the method of Lagrange multipliers informs us that there exists a number
@xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now by applying Hadamard’s variational formula (see [ HP , Chapter 5] )
we can directly compute that the derivatives of @xmath and @xmath are
given by:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the mean curvature of @xmath .

Therefore, we obtain that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since @xmath is arbitrary, we conclude that @xmath on @xmath . The value
@xmath can be computed by using Minkowski’s identity ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and equals the number @xmath given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This argument proves that soap bubbles must have constant mean
curvature. In turn, Alexandrov’s theorem informs us that they must be
spheres.

Similar arguments can be applied to optimization of other physical
quantities, which also satisfy inequalities of isoperimetric type. A
celebrated example, which is connected with the overdetermined problem (
1 ), ( 2 ), is given by Saint Venant’s Principle , explained below.

To this aim we introduce the torsional rigidity @xmath of a bar of
cross-section @xmath , that after some normalizations, can be defined as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

As mentioned in [ Se ] , this quantity is related to the solution @xmath
of ( 1 ). In fact, it turns out that @xmath realizes the maximum above,
and we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Saint Venant’s Principle (or the isoperimetric inequality for the
torsional rigidity) states that the ball maximizes @xmath among sets of
given volume. The standard proof of this result also uses rearrangement
techniques and can be found in [ PS , Section 1.12] . Here, in analogy
to what done just before, we simply show the relation between Saint
Venant’s Principle and problem ( 1 ),( 2 ).

Thus, we suppose that a set @xmath (of class @xmath ) maximizing @xmath
among sets of given volume exists and consider the one-parameter family
@xmath such that @xmath already defined.

This time, as the parameter @xmath changes, we must describe how the
solution @xmath of ( 1 ) in @xmath changes, since the torsional rigidity
of @xmath reads as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By using the method of Lagrange multipliers as before, we deduce that
there exists a number @xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By Hadamard’s variational formula (see [ HP , Chapter 5] ), we can
compute

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath , and @xmath is the derivative of @xmath with respect to
@xmath , evaluated at @xmath . Moreover, it turns out that @xmath is the
solution of the problem

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, we immediately find that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

after an integration by parts in the last equality. By using this last
formula together with the fact that @xmath on @xmath , and recalling the
already computed expression for @xmath , we conclude that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since @xmath is arbitrary, we deduce that @xmath on @xmath . By the
identity

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we then compute @xmath , where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The core of this thesis concerns symmetry and stability results for the
Soap Bubble Theorem, Serrin’s problem, and some other related problems.
Most of the material and techniques presented in this part are contained
in the papers [ MP2 , MP3 , Po ] , that are already published or in
print. However, in the process of writing the thesis, we realized that
some of the stability results described in those papers could be
sensibly improved. Thus, we present our results in this new (technically
equivalent) form.

Integral identities and symmetry. The Soap Bubble Theorem and Serrin’s
result share several common features. To prove his result, Alexandrov
introduced his reflection principle, an elegant geometric technique that
also works for other symmetry results concerning curvatures. Serrin’s
proof hinges on his method of moving planes, an adaptation and
refinement of the reflection principle. That method proves to be a very
flexible tool, since it allows to prove radial symmetry for positive
solutions of a far more general class of non-linear equations, that
includes the semi-linear equation

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (5)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath is a locally Lipschitz continuous non-linearity.

Also, alternative proofs of both symmetry results can be given, based on
certain integral identities and inequalities. In fact, in the same issue
of the journal in which [ Se ] is published, H. F. Weinberger [ We ]
gave a different proof of Serrin’s symmetry result for problem ( 1 )-( 2
) based on integration by parts, a maximum principle for an appropriate
@xmath -function, and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. These ideas can be
extended to the Soap Bubble Theorem, using R. C. Reilly’s argument ( [
Rl ] ), in which the relevant hypersurface is regarded as the zero level
surface of the solution of ( 1 ). The connection between ( 1 )-( 2 ) and
the Soap Bubble problem is then hinted by the simple differential
identity

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

here, @xmath and @xmath are the gradient and the hessian matrix of
@xmath , as standard. If we agree to still denote by @xmath the vector
field @xmath (that on @xmath coincides with the outward unit normal),
the above identity and ( 1 ) inform us that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

on every non-critical level surface of @xmath , and hence on @xmath . In
fact, a well known formula states that the mean curvature @xmath (with
respect to the inner normal) of a regular level surface of @xmath equals

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In both problems, the radial symmetry of @xmath will follow from that of
the solution @xmath of ( 1 ). In fact, we will show that in Newton’s
inequality,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

that holds pointwise in @xmath by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the
equality sign is identically attained in @xmath . The point is that such
equality holds if and only if @xmath is a quadratic polynomial @xmath of
the form

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for some choice of @xmath and @xmath (see Lemma 1.9 ). The boundary
condition in ( 1 ) will then tell us that @xmath must be a sphere
centered at @xmath .

The starting points of our analysis are the following two integral
identities (see Theorems 1.3 and 1.7 ):

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (6)
  -- -------- -- -----

and

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (7)
  -- -------- -- -----

Here, @xmath and @xmath are the already mentioned reference constants:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Identities ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) hold regardless of how the point @xmath or
the constant @xmath are chosen for @xmath . Identity ( 6 ), claimed in [
MP2 , Remark 2.5] and proved in [ MP3 ] , puts together and refine
Weinberger’s identities and some remarks of L. E. Payne and
P. W. Schaefer [ PS ] . Identity ( 7 ) was proved in [ MP2 , Theorem
2.2] by polishing the arguments contained in [ Rl ] .

It is thus evident that each of the two identities gives spherical
symmetry if respectively @xmath or @xmath on @xmath , since Newton’s
inequality holds with the equality sign (notice that in ( 6 ) @xmath by
the strong maximum principle). The same conclusion is also achieved if
we only assume that @xmath or @xmath are constant on @xmath , since
those constants must equal @xmath and @xmath , as already observed.

Thus, ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) give new elegant proofs of Alexandrov’s and
Serrin’s results. Moreover, they have several advantages that we shall
describe in this and the next section.

One advantage is that we can obtain symmetry under weaker assumptions.
In fact, observe that to get spherical symmetry it is enough to prove
that the right-hand sides in the two identities are non-positive. For
instance, in the case of the Soap Bubble Theorem (see Theorem 1.12 ) one
gets the spherical symmetry if

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which is certainly true if @xmath on @xmath .

Such slight generalization has been exploited in [ Po ] to improve a
symmetry result of Garofalo and Sartori ( [ GS ] ) for the p-capacitary
potential with constant normal derivative. In fact, in [ Po ] the
star-shaped assumption used in [ GS ] has been removed.

Another advantage is that ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) tell us something more about
Saint Venant’s principle and the classical isoperimetric problem
described in the previous section.

In fact, it has been noticed in [ Ma , Theorem 7] that, to infer that a
domain @xmath is a ball, it is sufficient to require that, under the
flow ( 3 )-( 4 ) with the choice @xmath , the function

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

has non-positive derivative at @xmath . In particular, the same
conclusion holds if @xmath is a critical point. In fact, with that
choice of @xmath , ( 4 ) gives that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the conclusion follows from ( 6 ).

For the case of the classical isoperimetric problem we can deduce a
similar statement. In fact we can infer that a domain @xmath is a ball
if, under the flow ( 3 )-( 4 ) with the choice @xmath , the function

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

has non-positive derivative at @xmath . In particular, the same
conclusion holds if @xmath is a critical point. In fact, with that
choice of @xmath , ( 4 ) gives that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the conclusion follows from ( 7 ).

Thus, ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) inform us that the flows generated respectively by
@xmath and @xmath are quite privileged.

Stability results. The greatest benefit produced by our identities are
undoubtedly the stability results for the Soap Bubble Theorem, Serrin’s
problem, and other related overdetermined problems.

Technically speaking, there are several ways to describe the closeness
of a domain to a ball. In this thesis, we mainly privilege the
following: find two concentric balls @xmath and @xmath , centered at
@xmath with radii @xmath and @xmath , such that

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (8)
  -- -------- -- -----

and

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (9)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath is a continuous function vanishing at @xmath and @xmath is
a suitable measure of the deviation of @xmath or @xmath from being a
constant.

The landmark results of this thesis are the following stability
estimates:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (10)
  -- -------- -- ------

and

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (11)
  -- -------- -- ------

In ( 10 ) (see Theorem 4.2 for details), @xmath , @xmath is arbitrarily
close to one, and @xmath for @xmath . In ( 11 ) (see Theorem 4.9 for
details), @xmath for @xmath , @xmath is arbitrarily close to one, and
@xmath for @xmath .

The constants @xmath depend on the dimension @xmath , the diameter
@xmath , the radii @xmath , @xmath of the uniform interior and exterior
sphere conditions, and the distance @xmath of @xmath to @xmath . As
pointed out in Remarks 3.21 and 3.22 , the dependence on @xmath of the
constants in ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) can (so far) be removed when @xmath is
convex or by assuming some additional requirements.

The stability results for Serrin’s problem so far obtained in the
literature can be divided into two groups, depending on the method
employed. One is based on a quantitative study of the method of moving
planes and hinges on the use of Harnack’s inequality. In [ ABR ] , where
the stability issue was considered for the first time, ( 8 ) and ( 9 )
are obtained with @xmath and @xmath . The estimate was later improved in
[ CMV ] to get

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The exponent @xmath can be computed for a general setting and, if @xmath
is convex, is arbitrarily close to @xmath . It should be also stressed
that the method works in the more general case of the semilinear
equation ( 5 ).

The approach of using integral identities and inequalities, in the wake
of Weinberger’s proof of symmetry, was inaugurated in [ BNST ] , and
later improved in [ Fe ] and [ MP3 ] . This method has worked so far
only for problem ( 1 ), though.

The main result in [ BNST ] states that (if a uniform bound on @xmath is
assumed) @xmath can be approximated in measure by a finite number of
mutually disjoint balls @xmath . The error in the approximation is
@xmath where @xmath . There, it is also proved that ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) hold
with @xmath and @xmath .

In [ MP3 , Theorem 1.1] we have obtained @xmath where @xmath , which
already improves on [ ABR , CMV , BNST ] . While writing this thesis, we
obtained ( 10 ), that improves on [ MP3 ] (for every @xmath ) to the
extent that it gains the (optimal) Lipschitz stability in the case
@xmath .

In this thesis we will also consider a weaker @xmath -deviation (as in [
BNST ] ) and prove (see Theorem 4.3 ) the inequality

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (12)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the same appearing in ( 10 ). Also this inequality is
new and refines one stated in [ MP3 , Theorem 3.6] in which @xmath was
replaced by @xmath . Of course, that inequality was already better than
that obtained in [ BNST ] .

In [ Fe ] instead, a different measure of closeness to spherical
symmetry is adopted, by considering a slight modification of the
so-called Fraenkel asymmetry:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (13)
  -- -------- -- ------

Here, @xmath denotes the symmetric difference of @xmath and @xmath . It
is then obtained a Lipschitz-type estimate: @xmath . The control given
by @xmath is stronger than that given by @xmath (see Section 4.3 ).

Let us now turn our attention to the Soap Bubble Theorem and comment on
our estimate ( 11 ).

The only stability result based on Alexandrov’s reflection principle has
been obtained in [ CV ] and states that there exist two positive
constants @xmath , @xmath such that ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) hold for @xmath if
@xmath In [ CM ] and [ KM ] , similar results (again with the uniform
deviation) are obtained, based on the proof of the Soap Bubble Theorem
via Heintze-Karcher’s inequality (that holds if @xmath is mean convex)
given in [ Ro1 ] . Moreover, in [ KM ] ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) are obtained also
with @xmath and @xmath , for surfaces that are small normal deformations
of spheres.

Further advances have been obtained in [ MP3 , Theorem 1.2] and [ MP2 ,
Theorem 4.1] . In fact, based on Reilly’s proof ( [ Rl ] ) of the Soap
Bubble Theorem, ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) are shown to hold for general surfaces
respectively with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Here, @xmath for @xmath , and @xmath for @xmath . Both these estimates
are improved by ( 11 ) and

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (14)
  -- -------- -- ------

(see Theorem 4.11 ), which are original material of this thesis. In ( 14
), @xmath is the same appearing in ( 11 ). If we compare the exponents
in ( 11 ) and ( 14 ) to those obtained in [ MP3 , Theorem 1.2] and [ MP2
, Theorem 4.1] , we notice that the dependence of @xmath on @xmath has
become virtually continuous, in the sense that @xmath , if @xmath
“approaches” @xmath from below or from above.

As a final important achievement, by arguments similar to those of [ Fe
] , we report in Theorem 4.14 the (optimal) inequality for the asymmetry
( 13 ) obtained in [ MP3 , Theorem 4.6] :

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (15)
  -- -------- -- ------

In the remaining part of this introduction, we shall pinpoint the key
remarks in the proof of ( 10 ) and ( 11 ).

First, notice that the function @xmath is harmonic and we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, ( 6 ) reads as:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (16)
  -- -------- -- ------

Also, since @xmath on @xmath , if we choose @xmath in @xmath , it holds
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now, observe that ( 16 ) holds regardless of the choice of the
parameters @xmath and @xmath defining @xmath . We will thus complete the
first step of our proof by choosing @xmath in a way that the oscillation
of @xmath on @xmath can be bounded in terms of the volume integral in (
16 ).

To carry out this plan, we use three ingredients. First, as done in
Lemmas 3.14 and 3.17 , we show that the oscillation of @xmath on @xmath
, and hence @xmath can be bounded from above in the following way:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (17)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the mean value of @xmath on @xmath and @xmath . We
emphasize that this inequality is new and generalizes to any @xmath the
estimate obtained in [ MP2 , Lemma 3.3] for @xmath .

Secondly (see Lemma 3.1 ), we easily obtain the bound

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thirdly, we choose @xmath as a minimum (or any critical) point of @xmath
and we apply two integral inequalities to @xmath and its first
(harmonic) derivatives. One is the Hardy-Poincaré-type inequality

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (18)
  -- -------- -- ------

that is applied to the first (harmonic) derivatives of @xmath . It holds
for any harmonic function @xmath in @xmath that is zero at some given
point in @xmath (in our case that point will be @xmath , since @xmath ),
when @xmath are three numbers such that either @xmath , @xmath , @xmath
(see Lemma 3.9 ), or @xmath and @xmath (see Lemma 3.5 ). The other one
is applied to @xmath and is the Poincaré-type inequality

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (19)
  -- -------- -- ------

that holds for any function @xmath with zero mean value on @xmath ,
where @xmath and @xmath must satisfy the same inequalities mentioned
above for ( 18 ) when @xmath (see Lemmas 3.9 and 3.5 ). This third step
is accomplished in Theorem 3.18 , where all the details can be found.

Thus, putting together the above arguments gives that (see Theorem 3.18
) there exists a constant @xmath depending on @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (20)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is that appearing in ( 10 ). We mention that in dimension
@xmath there is no need to use ( 17 ), thanks to Sobolev imbedding
theorem (see item (i) of Theorem 3.18 ).

Next, we work on the right-hand side of ( 16 ). The important
observation is that, if @xmath tends to @xmath , also @xmath does.
Quantitatively, this fact can be expressed by the inequality

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (21)
  -- -------- -- ------

that can be derived (see the proof of Theorem 4.2 ) by exploiting
arguments contained in [ Fe ] . Thus, after an application of Hölder’s
inequality to the right-hand side of ( 16 ), by ( 21 ) we deduce that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and ( 10 ) will follow by ( 20 ).

Let us now sketch the proof of ( 11 ). We fix again @xmath at a local
minimum point of @xmath in @xmath . In this way, @xmath and @xmath is
such that @xmath

Thus, as before we can apply to @xmath and to its first (harmonic)
derivatives the Poincaré-type inequalities ( 19 ) and ( 18 ) (with
@xmath ). In this way, by exploiting again ( 17 ), we get that (see
Theorem 3.20 ) there exists a constant @xmath depending on @xmath ,
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (22)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is that appearing in ( 11 ). We mention that when @xmath ,
there is no need to use ( 17 ), thanks to Sobolev imbedding theorem (see
item (i) of Theorem 3.20 ).

Next, we work on the right-hand side of ( 7 ) and we notice that it can
be rewritten as (see Theorem 1.7 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence, ( 7 ) can be written in terms of @xmath as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (23)
  -- -------- -- ------

Discarding the first summand at the left-hand side of ( 23 ) and
applying Hölder’s inequality and ( 21 ) to its right-hand side yield
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, by discarding the second summand at the left-hand side of ( 23 )
we get

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence, ( 11 ) easily follows by putting together this last inequality
and ( 22 ).

Plan of the work. The core of the thesis comprises four chapters.

Chapter 1 contains integral identities and related symmetry results. In
Section 1.1 we prove ( 6 ) and ( 7 ), as well as other related
identities. Section 1.2 contains the corresponding relevant symmetry
results.

Chapter 2 describes symmetry theorems that concern overdetermined
problems for @xmath -harmonic functions in exterior and punctured
domains. They are essentially the results proved in [ Po ] .

In Chapter 3 we collect all the estimates for the torsional rigidity
density @xmath and the harmonic function @xmath that will be useful to
derive our stability results. Section 3.1 is dedicated to the function
@xmath and contains pointwise estimates for @xmath and its gradient.
Section 3.2 collects Hardy-Poincaré inequalities as well as a proof of a
trace inequality for harmonic functions which is the key ingredient to
get ( 21 ). In Section 3.3 we present the crucial lemma which allows to
prove ( 17 ). All the inequalities for the particular harmonic function
@xmath that are necessary to get our stability estimates are presented
in Section 3.4 , as a consequence of Sections 3.1 , 3.2 , 3.3 .

Chapter 4 contains all the stability results for the spherical
configuration. Section 4.1 is devoted to the case of Serrin’s problem (
1 ), ( 2 ) and contains the proof of inequalities ( 10 ) and ( 12 ).
Section 4.2 is devoted to the case of Alexandrov’s Soap Bubble Theorem
and contains the proof of ( 11 ) and ( 14 ). In Section 4.3 we consider
the asymmetry @xmath defined in ( 13 ), we prove ( 15 ), and we compare
@xmath with @xmath . Finally, Section 4.4 collects other related
stability results.

As already mentioned, the second part of the thesis, entitled “Other
works”, contains a couple of papers as they were published. For the sake
of coherence with the topic of this dissertation, we decided not to
present them in the main part.

In chapter 2 are reported the lecture notes [ CP ] of a CIME summer
course taught by Prof. Xavier Cabré in Cetraro during the week of June
19-23, 2017. The author of the present thesis attended that course and
then collaborated in writing those notes.

The second paper, reported in Chapter 3 , is [ MP1 ] . That is a short
article stimulated by some remarks made while the author of the present
thesis was attending (as undergraduate student) the class “Analisi
Matematica III” taught by Prof. Rolando Magnanini at the Università di
Firenze.

### Chapter 1 Integral identities and symmetry

In this chapter, we shall present a number of integral identities which
our symmetry and stability results are based on. In them, the torsional
rigidity density @xmath , i.e. the solution of ( 1 ), plays the main
role. Their proofs are combinations of the divergence theorem,
differential identities, and some ad hoc manipulations.

Before we start, we set some relevant notations. By @xmath , @xmath , we
shall denote a bounded domain, that is a connected bounded open set, and
call @xmath its boundary. By @xmath and @xmath , we will denote
indifferently the @xmath -dimensional Lebesgue measure of @xmath and the
surface measure of @xmath . When @xmath is of class @xmath , @xmath will
denote the (exterior) unit normal vector field to @xmath and, when
@xmath is of class @xmath , @xmath will denote its mean curvature (with
respect to @xmath ) at @xmath .

As already done in the introduction, we set @xmath and @xmath to be the
two reference constants given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

and we use the letter @xmath to denote the quadratic polynomial defined
by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is any point in @xmath and @xmath is any real number.

#### 1.1 Integral identities for the torsional rigidity density

We start by recalling the following classical Rellich-Pohozaev identity
( [ Poh ] ).

###### Lemma 1.1 (Rellich-Pohozaev identity).

Let @xmath be a domain with boundary @xmath of class @xmath . For every
function @xmath , it holds that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### Proof.

By direct computation it is easy to verify the following differential
identity:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, ( 1.3 ) easily follows by integrating over @xmath and applying the
divergence theorem. ∎

We now focus our attention on the solution @xmath of ( 1 ). In this
case, it is easy to check that ( 1.3 ) becomes the identity stated in
the following corollary.

###### Corollary 1.2 (Rellich-Pohozaev identity for the torsional
rigidity density).

Let @xmath be a bounded domain with boundary @xmath of class @xmath ,
@xmath . Then the solution @xmath of ( 1 ) satisfies the identity

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath denotes the quadratic polynomial defined in ( 1.2 ).

###### Proof.

If @xmath is of class @xmath , then @xmath , and hence ( 1.3 ) holds.
Since @xmath satisfies ( 1 ), the following differential identity holds

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By integrating over @xmath , applying the divergence theorem, and
recalling the boundary condition in ( 1 ), we obtain that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, the left-hand side of ( 1.3 ) becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

On the other hand, by using the fact that @xmath on @xmath , the
right-hand side of ( 1.3 ) becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the conclusion follows. ∎

Following the tracks of Weinberger [ We ] we introduce the P-function,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

and we easily compute that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

We are now ready to provide the proof of the fundamental identity for
Serrin’s problem.

###### Theorem 1.3 (Fundamental identity for Serrin’s problem, [Mp2,
Mp3]).

Let @xmath be a bounded domain with boundary @xmath of class @xmath ,
@xmath , and @xmath be the positive constant defined in ( 1.1 ). Then
the solution @xmath of ( 1 ) satisfies

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### Proof.

First, suppose that @xmath is of class @xmath , so that @xmath .
Integration by parts then gives:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, since @xmath satisfies ( 1 ), we have that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

being @xmath on @xmath .

Next, notice that we can write @xmath By the divergence theorem and (
1.4 ) we then compute:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, this identity, ( 1.8 ), and ( 1.6 ) give ( 1.7 ), since

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

being @xmath harmonic in @xmath .

If @xmath is of class @xmath , then @xmath . Thus, by a standard
approximation argument, we conclude that ( 1.7 ) holds also in this
case. ∎

###### Remark 1.4.

The assumptions on the regularity of @xmath can further be weakened. For
instance, if @xmath is a (bounded) convex domain, then inequality ( 3.5
) below gives that @xmath is essentially bounded on @xmath with respect
to the @xmath -dimensional Hausdorff measure on @xmath . Thus, an
approximation argument again gives that ( 1.7 ) holds true.

We now present a couple of integral identities, involving the torsional
rigidity density @xmath and a harmonic function @xmath , which are
necessary to establish a useful trace inequality (see Lemma 3.13 below).

###### Lemma 1.5.

Let @xmath be a bounded domain with boundary @xmath of class @xmath ,
@xmath , and let @xmath be the solution of ( 1 ). Then, for every
harmonic function @xmath in @xmath the following two identities hold:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Proof.

We begin with the following differential identity:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

that holds for any @xmath harmonic function in @xmath , if @xmath
satisfies ( 1 ). Next, we integrate on @xmath and, by the divergence
theorem, we get ( 1.9 ). If we use ( 1.9 ) with @xmath , and hence we
sum up over @xmath , we obtain ( 1.10 ). ∎

We now prove several integral identities which involve the mean
curvature function @xmath . We start with the following one, that can be
obtained by polishing the arguments contained in [ Rl ] .

###### Theorem 1.6.

Let @xmath be a bounded domain with boundary @xmath of class @xmath and
denote by @xmath the mean curvature of @xmath .

If @xmath is the solution of ( 1 ), then the following identity holds:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Proof.

Let @xmath be given by ( 1.5 ). By the divergence theorem we can write:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

To compute @xmath , we observe that @xmath is parallel to @xmath on
@xmath , that is @xmath on @xmath . Thus,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We recall Reilly’s identity from the introduction,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

from which we obtain that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and hence

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

on @xmath .

Therefore, ( 1.11 ) follows from this identity, ( 1.6 ), ( 1.12 ) and
the formula

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

that is an easy consequence of the divergence theorem. ∎

###### Theorem 1.7 (Identities for the Soap Bubble Theorem, [Mp2, Mp3]).

Let @xmath be a bounded domain with boundary @xmath of class @xmath and
denote by @xmath the mean curvature of @xmath . Let @xmath and @xmath be
the two positive constants defined in ( 1.1 ).

If @xmath is the solution of ( 1 ), then the following two identities
hold true:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Proof.

Since, by ( 1.13 ), we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, ( 1.14 ) follows from this identity and ( 1.11 ) at once.

Identity ( 1.15 ) can be proved just by rearranging the right-hand side
of ( 1.14 ). In fact, straightforward calculations that use ( 1.1 ) and
Minkowski’s identity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

tell us that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and hence ( 1.15 ) follows. ∎

We finally show that, if @xmath is mean-convex, that is @xmath , ( 1.18
) can also be rearranged into an identity leading to Heintze-Karcher’s
inequality ( 1.21 ) below (see [ HK ] ).

###### Theorem 1.8 ([Mp2]).

Let @xmath be a bounded domain with boundary @xmath of class @xmath and
denote by @xmath the mean curvature of @xmath . Let @xmath be the
solution of ( 1 ).

If @xmath is mean-convex, then we have the following identity:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Proof.

Since ( 1.13 ) holds, from ( 1.11 ) we obtain that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

Notice that ( 1.18 ) still holds without the assumption @xmath .

Since @xmath and @xmath are continuous, the identity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

holds pointwise for @xmath .

If the integral @xmath is infinite, then ( 1.17 ) trivially holds.
Otherwise @xmath is finite (and hence @xmath ) almost everywhere on
@xmath and hence, ( 1.19 ) holds almost everywhere. Thus, by integrating
( 1.19 ) on @xmath , summing the result up to ( 1.18 ) and taking into
account ( 1.13 ), we get ( 1.17 ). ∎

#### 1.2 Symmetry results

The quantity at the right-hand side of ( 1.6 ), that we call
Cauchy-Schwarz deficit for the hessian matrix @xmath , will play the
role of detector of spherical symmetry, as is clear from the following
lemma. In what follows, @xmath denotes the identity matrix.

###### Lemma 1.9 (Spherical detector).

Let @xmath be a domain and @xmath . Then it holds that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the equality sign holds if and only if @xmath is a quadratic
polynomial.

Moreover, if @xmath is the solution of ( 1 ), the equality sign holds if
and only if @xmath is a sphere (and hence @xmath is a ball) of radius
@xmath given by ( 1.1 ) and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

up to a translation.

###### Proof.

We regard the matrices @xmath and @xmath as vectors in @xmath .
Inequality ( 1.20 ) is then the classical Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

For the characterization of the equality case, we first consider @xmath
solution of ( 1 ) and we set @xmath . Since @xmath is harmonic, direct
computations show that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, @xmath is affine and @xmath is quadratic. Therefore, @xmath can be
written in the form ( 1.2 ), for some @xmath and @xmath .

Since @xmath on @xmath , then @xmath for @xmath , that is @xmath must be
a sphere centered at @xmath . Moreover, @xmath must be positive and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In conclusion, @xmath is a sphere centered at @xmath with radius @xmath
.

If @xmath is any @xmath function for which the equality holds in ( 1.20
), we can still conclude that @xmath is a quadratic polynomial. In fact,
being ( 1.20 ) the classical Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in @xmath , if
the equality sign holds we have that @xmath . Since

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we immediately realize that the function @xmath must be a constant
@xmath . Notice that, this conclusion surely holds if @xmath is of class
@xmath . However, even if @xmath is of class @xmath , the last two
differential identities still hold in the sense of distributions and the
same conclusion follows. Thus, by integrating directly the system @xmath
, we obtain that @xmath must be a quadratic polynomial. ∎

As an immediate corollary of Theorem 1.3 we have the following more
general version of Serrin’s symmetry result.

###### Theorem 1.10 (Symmetry for the torsional rigidity density,
[Mp3]).

Let @xmath be a bounded domain with boundary @xmath of class @xmath ,
@xmath . Let @xmath be the positive constant defined in ( 1.1 ), and
@xmath be the solution of ( 1 ).

If the right-hand side of ( 1.7 ) is non-positive, @xmath must be a
sphere (and hence @xmath a ball) of radius @xmath . The same conclusion
clearly holds if either @xmath is constant on @xmath or @xmath on @xmath
.

###### Proof.

If the right-hand side of ( 1.7 ) is non-positive, then the integrand at
the left-hand side must be zero, being non-negative by ( 1.20 ) and the
maximum principle for @xmath . Then ( 1.20 ) must hold with the equality
sign, since @xmath on @xmath , by the strong maximum principle. The
conclusion follows from Lemma 1.9 .

Finally, if @xmath on @xmath for some constant @xmath , then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

that is @xmath , and hence we can apply the previous argument.

The same conclusion clearly holds if @xmath on @xmath . Notice that in
this case a simpler alternative proof is available. In fact, since
@xmath is harmonic in @xmath and @xmath on @xmath , then @xmath must be
constant on @xmath . ∎

###### Remark 1.11.

Based on the work of Vogel [ Vo ] , the regularity assumption on @xmath
can be dropped, if ( 1 ) and the conditions @xmath , @xmath on @xmath
(for some constant @xmath ) are stated in a weak sense. In fact, if
@xmath is a function such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for every @xmath , and for all @xmath there exists a neighborhood @xmath
such that @xmath and @xmath for a.e. @xmath , [ Vo , Theorem 1] ensures
that @xmath must be of class @xmath .

As an immediate corollary of Theorem 1.7 we have the following more
general version of the Soap Bubble Theorem.

###### Theorem 1.12 (Soap Bubble-type Theorem, [Mp2]).

Let @xmath be a surface of class @xmath , which is the boundary of a
bounded domain @xmath , and let @xmath be the solution of ( 1 ). Let
@xmath and @xmath be the two positive constants defined in ( 1.1 ).

If the right-hand side of ( 1.14 ) is non-positive, then @xmath must be
a sphere of radius @xmath . In particular, the same conclusion holds if
either the mean curvature @xmath of @xmath satisfies the inequality
@xmath or @xmath is constant on @xmath .

###### Proof.

If the right-hand side in ( 1.14 ) is non-positive (and this certainly
happens if @xmath on @xmath ), then both summands at the left-hand side
must be zero, being non-negative.

The fact that also the first summand is zero gives that the
Cauchy-Schwarz deficit for the hessian matrix @xmath must be identically
zero and the conclusion follows from Lemma 1.9 .

If @xmath equals some constant, instead, then ( 1.16 ) tells us that the
constant must equal @xmath , and hence we can apply the previous
argument. ∎

###### Remark 1.13.

(i) As pointed out in the previous proof, the assumption of the theorem
also gives that the second summand at the left-hand side of ( 1.14 )
must be zero, and hence @xmath on @xmath . Thus, Serrin’s
overdetermining condition ( 2 ) holds before showing that @xmath is a
ball .

(ii) We observe that the assumption that @xmath on @xmath gives that
@xmath , anyway, if @xmath is strictly star-shaped with respect to some
origin @xmath . In fact, by Minkowski’s identity ( 1.16 ), we obtain
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and we know that @xmath for @xmath .

We now show that ( 1.17 ) implies Heintze-Karcher’s inequality (see [ HK
] ). We mention that our proof is slightly different from that of A. Ros
in [ Ro1 ] and relates the equality case for Heintze-Karcher’s
inequality to a new overdetermined problem, which is described in item
(ii) of the following theorem. As it will be clear, ( 1.17 ) also gives
an alternative proof of Alexandrov’s theorem via the characterization of
the equality sign in Heintze-Karcher’s inequality ( 1.21 ).

###### Theorem 1.14 (Heintze-Karcher’s inequality and a related
overdetermined problem, [Mp2]).

Let @xmath be a mean-convex surface of class @xmath , which is the
boundary of a bounded domain @xmath , and denote by @xmath its mean
curvature. Then,

1.   Heintze-Karcher’s inequality

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (1.21)
      -- -------- -- --------

    holds and the equality sign is attained if and only if @xmath is a
    ball;

2.  @xmath is a ball if and only if the solution @xmath of ( 1 )
    satisfies

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (1.22)
      -- -------- -- --------

###### Proof.

(i) Both summands at the left-hand side of ( 1.17 ) are non-negative and
hence ( 1.21 ) follows. If the right-hand side is zero, those summands
must be zero. The vanishing of the first summand implies that @xmath is
a ball, as already noticed. Note in passing that the vanishing of the
second summand gives that @xmath on @xmath , which also implies radial
symmetry, by item (ii).

(ii) It is clear that, if @xmath is a ball, then ( 1.22 ) holds.
Conversely, it is easy to check that the right-hand side and the second
summand of the left-hand side of ( 1.17 ) are zero when ( 1.22 ) occurs.
Thus, the conclusion follows from Lemma 1.9 .

Notice that assumption ( 1.22 ) implies that @xmath must be positive,
since @xmath is positive and finite. ∎

###### Remark 1.15.

(i) As already noticed in [ Ro1 ] , the characterization of the equality
sign of Heintze-Karcher’s inequality given in item (i) of Theorem 1.14 ,
leads to a different proof of the Soap Bubble Theorem. In fact, if
@xmath equals some constant on @xmath , by using Minkowski’s identity (
1.16 ) we know that such a constant must have the value @xmath in ( 1.1
). Thus, ( 1.21 ) holds with the equality sign, and hence @xmath is a
sphere by item (i) of Theorem 1.14 .

(ii) Item (ii) of Theorem 1.14 could be proved also by using ( 1.18 )
instead of ( 1.17 ). In fact, it is immediate to check that the
right-hand side of ( 1.18 ) is zero when ( 1.22 ) occurs.

We conclude this section by giving an alternative proof of Serrin’s
theorem that can have its own interest. Unfortunately, it only works for
star-shaped domains.

###### Theorem 1.16 (Theorem 2.4, [Mp2]).

Let @xmath , @xmath , be a bounded domain with boundary @xmath of class
@xmath . Assume that @xmath for every @xmath and some @xmath , and let
@xmath be the solution of ( 1 ).

Then, @xmath is a ball if and only if @xmath satisfies ( 2 ).

###### Proof.

It is clear that, if @xmath is a ball, then ( 2 ) holds. Conversely, we
shall check that the right-hand side of ( 1.11 ) is zero when ( 2 )
occurs.

Let @xmath be constant on @xmath ; by ( 1.13 ) we know that that
constant equals the value @xmath given in ( 1.1 ). Also, notice that
@xmath on @xmath . In fact, the function @xmath in ( 1.5 ) is
subharmonic in @xmath , since @xmath by ( 1.6 ). Thus, it attains its
maximum on @xmath , where it is constant. We thus have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

by ( 1.16 ). Thus, @xmath on @xmath and hence item (ii) of Theorem 1.14
applies. ∎

### Chapter 2 Radial symmetry for @xmath-harmonic functions in exterior
and punctured domains

In this chapter, we collect symmetry results obtained in [ Po ] ,
involving @xmath -harmonic functions in exterior and punctured domains.

#### 2.1 Motivations and statement of results

The electrostatic @xmath -capacity of a bounded open set @xmath , @xmath
, is defined by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Under appropriate sufficient conditions, there exists a unique
minimizing function @xmath of ( 2.1 ); such function is called the
@xmath -capacitary potential of @xmath , and satisfies

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the boundary of @xmath and @xmath denotes the @xmath
-Laplace operator defined by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is well known that the @xmath -capacity could be equivalently defined
by means of the @xmath -capacitary potential @xmath as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the second equality follows by integration by parts (see the proof
of Lemma 2.6 ).

In Section 2.2 we consider Problem ( 2.2 ) under Serrin’s overdetermined
condition given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

and we prove the following result.

###### Theorem 2.1 ([Po]).

Let @xmath be a bounded domain (i.e., a connected bounded open set). For
@xmath , the problem ( 2.2 ), ( 2.4 ) admits a weak solution if and only
if @xmath is a ball.

By a weak solution in the statement of Theorem 2.1 we mean a function
@xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for every @xmath and satisfying the boundary conditions in the weak
sense, i.e.: for all @xmath there exists a neighborhood @xmath such that
@xmath and @xmath for a.e. @xmath .

Notice the complete absence in Theorem 2.1 of any smoothness assumption
as well as of any other assumption on the domain @xmath .

Under the additional assumption that @xmath is star-shaped, Theorem 2.1
has been proved by Garofalo and Sartori in [ GS ] , by extending to the
case @xmath the tools developed in the case @xmath by Payne and
Philippin ( [ PP2 ] , [ Ph ] ). The proof in [ GS ] , which combines
integral identities and a maximum principle for an appropriate @xmath
-function, bears a resemblance to Weinberger’s proof ( [ We ] ) of
symmetry for the archetype torsion problem ( 1 ) under Serrin’s
overdetermined condition ( 2 ).

To prove Theorem 2.1 , we improve on the arguments used in [ GS ] and we
exploit, as a new crucial ingredient, Theorem 1.12 , that is the Soap
Bubble-type Theorem proved via integral identities in Section 1.2 .

Symmetry for Problem ( 2.2 ), ( 2.4 ) was first obtained by Reichel ( [
Rc1 ] , [ Rc2 ] ) by adapting the method of moving planes introduced by
Serrin ( [ Se ] ) to prove symmetry for the overdetermined torsion
problem ( 1 ), ( 2 ). In Reichel’s works ( [ Rc1 ] , [ Rc2 ] ) the
star-shapedness assumption is not requested, but the domain @xmath is a
priori assumed to be @xmath and the solution @xmath is assumed to be of
class @xmath .

For completeness let us mention that many alternative proofs and
improvements in various directions of symmetry results for Serrin’s
problems relative to the equations ( 1 ) and ( 2.2 ) have been obtained
in the years and can be found in the literature: for the overdetermined
torsion problem ( 1 ), ( 2 ) see for example [ PS ] , [ GL ] , [ 21 ] ,
[ BH ] , [ BNST ] , [ FK ] , [ CiS ] , [ WX ] , [ MP3 ] , [ BC ] , and
the surveys [ Ma ] , [ NT ] , [ Ka ] ; for the exterior overdetermined
problem ( 2.2 ), ( 2.4 ) where the domain @xmath is assumed to be convex
see [ MR ] , [ BCS ] , [ BC ] , and [ FMP ] .

In Section 2.3 , we establish the result corresponding to Theorem 2.1 in
the special case @xmath . In this case, the problem corresponding to (
2.2 ) is (see e.g. [ CC ] ):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath means that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

for some positive constants @xmath , @xmath . What we prove is the
following.

###### Theorem 2.2 ([Po]).

Let @xmath , @xmath , be a bounded domain. The problem ( 2.5 ) with the
overdetermined condition ( 2.4 ) admits a weak solution if and only if
@xmath is a ball.

A proof of Theorem 2.2 that uses the method of moving planes is
contained in [ Rc2 ] , under the additional a priori smoothness
assumptions @xmath , @xmath . Our proof via integral identities seems to
be new and cannot be found in the literature unless for the classical
case @xmath , which has been treated with similar arguments in [ Mr ]
(for piecewise smooth domains) and [ MR ] (for Lipschitz domains).
Moreover, in Theorem 2.2 no assumptions on the domain @xmath are made.

We mention that a related symmetry result for the @xmath -capacitary
potential in a bounded (smooth) star-shaped ring domain has been
established in [ PP3 ] .

In Section 2.4 , we show how the same ideas used in our proof of Theorem
2.1 can be adapted to give a symmetry result for a similar problem in a
bounded punctured domain. More precisely, we prove the following theorem
concerning the problem

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

under Serrin’s overdetermined condition

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

where with @xmath we denote the Dirac delta centered at the origin
@xmath and @xmath is some positive normalization constant.

###### Theorem 2.3 ([Po]).

Let @xmath be a bounded star-shaped domain. For @xmath , the problem (
2.7 ), ( 2.8 ) admits a weak solution if and only if @xmath is a ball
centered at the origin.

It should be noticed, however, that in Theorem 2.3 we need to assume
@xmath to be star-shaped, restriction that is not present in the proofs
of Payne and Schaefer ( [ PS ] )(for the case @xmath ), Alessandrini and
Rosset ( [ AR ] ), and Enciso and Peralta-Salas ( [ EP ] ). We mention
that the proof in [ AR ] uses an adaptation of the method of moving
planes, the proof in [ EP ] is in the wake of Weinberger, and both of
them also cover the special case @xmath .

For @xmath , Problem ( 2.2 ) arises naturally in electrostatics. In this
context @xmath is the (normalized) potential of the electric field
@xmath generated by a conductor @xmath . We recall that when @xmath is
in the electric equilibrium, the electric field in the interior of
@xmath is null, and hence the electric potential @xmath is constant in
@xmath (i.e. @xmath in @xmath ); moreover, the electric charges present
in the conductor are distributed on the boundary @xmath of @xmath . It
is also known that the electric field @xmath on @xmath is orthogonal to
@xmath – i.e. @xmath , where @xmath denotes the outer unit normal with
respect to @xmath and @xmath denotes the derivative of @xmath in the
direction @xmath -- and its intensity is given ¹ ¹ 1 More precisely, in
free space the intensity of the electric field on @xmath is given by
@xmath , where @xmath is the surface charge density over @xmath and
@xmath is the vacuum permittivity. We ignored the constant @xmath to be
coherent with the mathematical definition of capacity given in ( 2.1 ).
by the surface charge density over @xmath . In this context the capacity
is defined as the total electric charge needed to induce the potential
@xmath , that is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

in accordance with ( 2.3 ) for @xmath . Following this physical
interpretation Theorem 2.1 simply states that the electric field on the
boundary @xmath of the conductor @xmath is constant – or equivalently
that the charges present in the conductor are uniformly distributed on
@xmath (i.e. the surface charge density is constant over @xmath ) – if
and only if @xmath is a round ball.

Another result of interest in the same context that is related to
Problem ( 2.2 ), ( 2.4 ) is a Poincaré’s theorem known as the
isoperimetric inequality for the capacity, stating that, among sets
having given volume, the ball minimizes @xmath . We mention that a proof
of this inequality that hinges on rearrangement techniques can be found
in [ PS , Section 1.12] (see also [ Ja ] for a useful review of that
proof). Here, – as done in the introduction for the isoperimetric
problem and Saint Venant’s principle – we just want to underline the
relation present between this result and Problem ( 2.2 ), ( 2.4 ) (for
@xmath ). In fact, once that the existence of a minimizing set @xmath is
established, we can show through the technique of shape derivatives that
the solution of ( 2.2 ) in @xmath also satisfies the overdetermined
condition ( 2.4 ) on @xmath ; the reasoning is the following.

We consider the evolution of the domains @xmath given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is fixed, and @xmath is a mapping such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the symbol @xmath means differentiation with respect to @xmath ,
@xmath is any compactly supported continuous function, and @xmath is a
proper extension of the unit normal vector field to a tubular
neighborhood of @xmath . Thus, we consider @xmath , solution of Problem
( 2.2 ) in @xmath , and the two functions (in the variable @xmath )
@xmath and @xmath . Since @xmath is the domain that minimizes @xmath
among all the domains in the one-parameter family @xmath that have
prescribed volume @xmath , by using the method of Lagrange multipliers
and Hadamard’s variational formula (see [ HP , Chapter 5] ), standard
computations lead to prove that there exists a number @xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where we have set @xmath . Since @xmath is arbitrary, we deduce that
@xmath on @xmath , that is, @xmath satisfies the overdetermined
condition ( 2.4 ) on @xmath .

Other applications of Problem ( 2.2 ) are related to quantum theory,
acoustic, theory of musical instruments, and the study of heat,
electrical and fluid flow (see for example [ CFG ] , [ DZH ] , [ BC ]
and references therein).

Finally, we just mention that also Problem ( 2.7 ) arises in
electrostatics for @xmath : in this case, Theorem 2.3 states that the
electric field on a conducting hypersurface enclosing a charge is
constant if and only if the conductor is a sphere centered at the
charge.

#### 2.2 The exterior problem: proof of Theorem 2.1

In order to prove Theorem 2.1 , we start by collecting all the necessary
ingredients. In this section @xmath denotes a weak solution to ( 2.2 ),(
2.4 ), in the sense explained in the Introduction, and it holds that
@xmath .

###### Remark 2.4 (On the regularity).

Due to the degeneracy or singularity of the @xmath -Laplacian (when
@xmath ) at the critical points of @xmath , @xmath is in general only
@xmath (see [ Di ] , [ Le ] , [ To ] ), whereas it is @xmath in a
neighborhood of any of its regular points thanks to standard elliptic
regularity theory (see [ GT ] ). However, as already noticed in [ GS ] ,
the additional assumption given by the weak boundary condition ( 2.4 )
ensures that @xmath can be extended to a @xmath -function in a
neighborhood of @xmath , so that by using the work of Vogel [ Vo ] we
get that @xmath is of class @xmath . Thus, by [ Li , Theorem 1] it turns
out that @xmath is @xmath . As a consequence we can now interpret the
boundary condition in ( 2.2 ) and the one in ( 2.4 ) in the classical
strong sense.

###### Remark 2.5.

More precisely, by using Vogel’s work [ Vo ] , which is based on the
deep results on free boundaries contained in [ AC ] and [ ACF ] , one
can prove that @xmath is of class @xmath from each side. Even if here we
do not need this refinement, it should be noticed that in light of this
remark the arguments contained in [ Rc2 ] give an alternative and
complete proof of Theorem 2.1 (and also of Theorem 2.2 ). In fact, the
smoothness assumptions of [ Rc2 , Theorem 1] are satisfied.

By using the ideas contained in [ GS ] together with a result of
Kichenassamy and Véron ( [ KV ] ), we can recover the following useful
asymptotic expansion for @xmath as @xmath tends to infinity.

###### Lemma 2.6 (Asymptotic expansion, [Po]).

As @xmath tends to infinity it holds that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

The computations leading to determine the constant of proportionality in
( 2.9 ) originate from [ GS ] , where they have been used to give a
complete proof – which works without invoking [ KV ] – of a different
but related result ( [ GS , Theorem 3.1] ), which is described in more
details in Remark 2.9 below. We mention that, later, in [ CoS ] the same
computations have been treated with tools of convex analysis and used
together with the result contained in [ KV , Remark 1.5] to prove Lemma
2.6 for convex sets.

###### Proof of Lemma 2.6.

As noticed in [ GS ] , if @xmath is a solution of ( 2.2 ), then the weak
comparison principle for the @xmath -Laplacian (see [ HKM ] ) implies
the existence of positive constants @xmath , @xmath , @xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath denotes the radial fundamental solution of the @xmath
-Laplace operator given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus we can apply the result of Kichenassamy and Véron ( [ KV , Remark
1.5] ) and state that there exists a constant @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

for all multi-indices @xmath with @xmath . To establish ( 2.9 ) now it
is enough to prove that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

this can be easily done, as already noticed in [ GS ] , through the
following integration by parts that holds true by the @xmath
-harmonicity of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here as in the rest of the chapter @xmath denotes the outer unit normal
with respect to the ball @xmath of radius @xmath , @xmath is the outer
unit normal with respect to @xmath , and @xmath (resp. @xmath ) is the
derivative of @xmath in the direction @xmath (resp. @xmath ). The
left-hand side of ( 2.12 ) is exactly @xmath as it is clear by ( 2.3 )
and the fact that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

moreover, the limit in the right-hand side of ( 2.12 ) can be explicitly
computed by using the second equation in ( 2.10 ) (with @xmath ) and it
turns out to be @xmath . Thus, ( 2.11 ) is proved and ( 2.9 ) follows.

For completeness, we explain here how to prove the second identity in (
2.3 ): we take the limit for @xmath of the following integration by
parts made on @xmath and we note that the integral on @xmath converge to
zero due to ( 2.10 ):

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The desired identity is thus proved just by recalling ( 2.13 ). ∎

It is well known that the value @xmath of @xmath on @xmath appearing in
the overdetermined condition ( 2.4 ) can be explicitly computed.

###### Lemma 2.7 (Explicit value of @xmath in (2.4)).

The constant @xmath appearing in ( 2.4 ) equals

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the constant defined in ( 1.1 ). Moreover, the following
explicit expression of the @xmath -capacity of @xmath holds:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Proof.

It is enough to use ( 2.3 ) together with the following
Rellich-Pohozaev-type identity:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

In fact, by using ( 2.4 ) in ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.16 ) we deduce respectively
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

from which we get ( 2.14 ) and ( 2.15 ).

Equation ( 2.16 ) comes directly by taking the limit for @xmath of the
following integration by parts made on @xmath and noting that the
integrals on @xmath converge to zero due to the asymptotic going of
@xmath at infinity given by ( 2.9 ):

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 2.16 ) is in fact proved just by recalling that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

∎

The P-function. As last ingredient, we introduce the @xmath -function

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

Notice that in the radial case, i.e. if @xmath is a ball of radius
@xmath centered at the point @xmath , we have that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

and thus

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In [ GS ] the authors have studied extensively the properties of the
function @xmath . In particular, in [ GS , Theorem 2.2] it is proved
that @xmath satisfies the strong maximum principle, i.e. the function
@xmath cannot attain a local maximum at an interior point of @xmath ,
unless @xmath is constant. We mention that this property for the case
@xmath was first established in [ PP2 ] .

Now that we collected all the ingredients, we are in position to give
the proof of Theorem 2.1 .

###### Proof of Theorem 2.1.

By ( 2.9 ) it is easy to check that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

from which, by using ( 2.15 ), we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

Moreover, by recalling the boundary condition in ( 2.2 ), ( 2.4 ), and (
2.14 ) we can compute that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

By using the classical isoperimetric inequality (see, e.g., [ BZ ] )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

by ( 2.21 ) and ( 2.22 ) it is easy to check that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence, by the strong maximum principle proved in [ GS , Theorem 2.2] ,
@xmath attains its maximum on @xmath and thus we can affirm that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

where, @xmath is still the outer unit normal with respect to @xmath . If
we directly compute @xmath and we use ( 2.18 ), we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

By the well known differential identity

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the @xmath -harmonicity of @xmath we deduce that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

By combining ( 2.24 ), ( 2.25 ), and ( 2.26 ) we get

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

from which, by using the fact that @xmath on @xmath , ( 2.4 ), ( 2.13 ),
and ( 2.14 ) we get

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We can now conclude by using Theorem 1.12 . ∎

###### Remark 2.8.

Since the solution of ( 2.2 ) in a ball is explicitly known, as a
corollary of Theorem 2.1 we get that @xmath is spherically symmetric
about the center @xmath of (the ball) @xmath and it is given by ( 2.20 )
with @xmath .

###### Remark 2.9.

As already mentioned before, in [ GS ] a result slightly different from
Lemma 2.6 is used. In fact, in [ GS , Theorem 3.1] it is proved,
independently from the work [ KV ] , that if @xmath takes its supremum
at infinity, then the asymptotic expansion ( 2.9 ) holds true and hence
@xmath exists and it is given by ( 2.21 ); clearly, that result would be
sufficient to complete the proof of Theorem 2.1 without invoking Lemma
2.6 .

###### Remark 2.10.

In [ GS ] , instead of the classical isoperimetric inequality, the
authors use the nonlinear version of the isoperimetric inequality for
the capacity mentioned in the Introduction stating that, for any bounded
open set @xmath , if @xmath denotes a ball such that @xmath , it holds
that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

with equality if and only if @xmath is a ball (for a proof see, e.g., [
Ge ] ).

Since the @xmath -capacity of a ball is known explicitly (see, e.g., [
GS , Equation (4.7)] ):

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

if we take @xmath such that @xmath , for @xmath ( 2.27 ) becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now we notice that, since ( 2.15 ) holds, ( 2.28 ) is equivalent to the
classical isoperimetric inequality ( 2.23 ). In fact, if we put ( 2.15 )
in ( 2.28 ), it is easy to check that ( 2.28 ) becomes exactly ( 2.23 ).

#### 2.3 The case @xmath: proof of Theorem 2.2

In the present section, we consider @xmath solution to the exterior
problem ( 2.5 ), ( 2.4 ), and @xmath . In order to give the proof of
Theorem 2.2 , we collect all the necessary ingredients in the following
remark.

###### Remark 2.11.

(i)(On the regularity). We notice that the regularity results invoked in
Remark 2.4 hold when @xmath , too.

(ii)(Asymptotic expansion). By ( 2.6 ), the result of Kichenassamy and
Véron ( [ KV , Remark 1.5] ) applies also in this case and hence we have
that ( 2.10 ) holds with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is easy to check that also Identity ( 2.12 ) still holds (with @xmath
replaced by @xmath ); by computing the limit in the right-hand side, and
by using ( 2.4 ) and the fact that @xmath in the left-hand side, ( 2.12
) leads to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

from which we deduce the following asymptotic expansion for @xmath at
infinity:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

We are ready now to prove Theorem 2.2 .

###### Proof of Theorem 2.2.

We just find the analogous of the Rellich-Pohozaev-type identity ( 2.17
) when @xmath ; since @xmath is @xmath -harmonic, now the vector field

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is divergence-free and thus integration by parts leads to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the left-hand side in ( 2.30 ), by using that @xmath on @xmath and (
2.4 ) we immediately find that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For the right-hand side in ( 2.30 ), by the asymptotic expansion ( 2.29
) we easily compute that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, ( 2.30 ) becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

that is the equality case of the classical isoperimetric inequality.
Hence @xmath must be a ball. ∎

###### Remark 2.12.

As a corollary of Theorem 2.2 we get that @xmath is spherically
symmetric about the center @xmath of (the ball) @xmath and it is given
by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

up to an additive constant.

#### 2.4 The interior problem: proof of Theorem 2.3

In the present section @xmath is a weak solution to ( 2.7 ), ( 2.8 ),
and @xmath . By a weak solution of ( 2.7 ), ( 2.8 ) we mean a function
@xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for every @xmath and satisfying the boundary condition in ( 2.7 ) and
the one in ( 2.8 ) in the weak sense explained after Theorem 2.1 .

In order to give our proof of Theorem 2.3 , we collect all the necessary
ingredients in the following remark.

###### Remark 2.13.

(i)(On the regularity). The regularity results presented for the
exterior problem in Remark 2.4 hold in the same way also for the
interior problem, so that, reasoning as explained there, we can affirm
that @xmath can be extended to a @xmath -function in a neighborhood of
@xmath , @xmath is of class @xmath , and @xmath .

(ii)(Explicit value of @xmath in ( 2.7 )). It is easy to show that the
normalization constant @xmath that appears in ( 2.7 ) must take the
value

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

to be compatible with the overdetermined condition ( 2.8 ) (see for
example [ EP ] ).

(iii)(Asymptotic expansion). As a direct application of [ KV , Theorem
1.1] , we deduce that the asymptotic behaviour of the solution @xmath of
( 2.7 ) near the origin is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

We mention that this expansion has been used also in [ EP ] .

The P-function. We consider again the P-function defined in ( 2.19 ); by
virtue of the weak @xmath -harmonicity of @xmath in @xmath , [ GS ,
Theorem 2.2] ensures that the strong maximum principle holds for @xmath
in @xmath .

We are ready now to prove Theorem 2.3 ; as announced in the
Introduction, the proof uses arguments similar to those used in the
proof of Theorem 2.1 .

###### Proof of Theorem 2.3.

As already noticed in [ EP ] , concerning the existence of a weak
solution to the overdetermined problem ( 2.7 ), ( 2.8 ), the actual
value of the function @xmath on @xmath is irrelevant, since any function
differing from @xmath by a constant is @xmath -harmonic whenever @xmath
is. Thus, let us now fix the constant @xmath that appears in ( 2.7 ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

with this choice and by recalling ( 2.8 ) we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Moreover, by using ( 2.31 ) we find also that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By the isoperimetric inequality ( 2.23 ) it is easy to check that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and hence, by the maximum principle proved in [ GS , Theorem 2.2] , we
realize that @xmath attains its maximum on @xmath . We thus have that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

By a direct computation, with exactly the same manipulations used for
the exterior problem in the proof of Theorem 2.1 , we find that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

By coupling ( 2.33 ) with ( 2.34 ), we can deduce that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

that by using ( 2.32 ), ( 2.7 ), ( 2.8 ), and the fact that @xmath on
@xmath , leads to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the constant defined in ( 1.1 ).

Since @xmath is star-shaped with respect to a point @xmath (possibly
distinct from @xmath ), we have that @xmath is non-negative on @xmath .
Thus, multiplying ( 2.35 ) by @xmath , and integrating over @xmath , we
get

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By recalling the regularity of @xmath and Minkowski’s identity

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we deduce – as already noticed in [ GS , Proof of Theorem 1.1] – that
the equality sign must hold in ( 2.35 ), that is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, the conclusion follows by the classical Alexandrov’s Soap Bubble
Theorem ( [ Al2 ] ) or, if we want, again by Theorem 1.12 . ∎

###### Remark 2.14.

As a corollary of Theorem 2.3 we get that @xmath is spherically
symmetric about the center @xmath of (the ball) @xmath and it is given
by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

up to an additive constant.

### Chapter 3 Some estimates for harmonic functions

As already sketched in the introduction, the desired stability estimates
for the spherical symmetry of @xmath will be obtained by linking the
oscillation on @xmath of the harmonic function @xmath , where @xmath is
the solution of ( 1 ) and @xmath is the quadratic polynomial defined in
( 1.2 ), to the integrals

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In order to fulfill this agenda, in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 we collect some
useful estimates for harmonic functions that have their own interest.

Then, in Section 3.4 we deduce some inequalities for the particular
harmonic function @xmath that will be useful for the study of the
stability issue addressed in Chapter 4 .

In Sections 3.3 and 3.4 , some pointwise estimates for the torsional
rigidity density will be useful. We collect them in the following
section.

Before we start, we set some relevant notations. For a point @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath denote the radius of the largest ball centered at
@xmath and contained in @xmath and that of the smallest ball that
contains @xmath with the same center, that is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

The diameter of @xmath is indicated by @xmath , while @xmath denotes the
distance of a point @xmath to the boundary @xmath . We recall that if
@xmath is of class @xmath , @xmath has the properties of the uniform
interior and exterior sphere condition, whose respective radii we have
designated by @xmath and @xmath . In other words, there exists @xmath
(resp. @xmath ) such that for each @xmath there exists a ball contained
in @xmath (resp. contained in @xmath ) of radius @xmath (resp. @xmath )
such that its closure intersects @xmath only at @xmath .

Finally, if @xmath is of class @xmath , the unique solution of ( 1 ) is
of class at least @xmath . Thus, we can define

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

#### 3.1 Pointwise estimates for the torsional rigidity density

We start with the following lemma in which we relate @xmath with the
distance function @xmath .

###### Lemma 3.1.

Let @xmath , @xmath , be a bounded domain such that @xmath is made of
regular points for the Dirichlet problem, and let @xmath be the solution
of ( 1 ). Then

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Moreover, if @xmath is of class @xmath , then it holds that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### Proof.

If every point of @xmath is regular, then a unique solution @xmath
exists for ( 1 ). Now, for @xmath , let @xmath and consider the ball
@xmath . Let @xmath be the solution of ( 1 ) in @xmath , that is @xmath
. By comparison we have that @xmath on @xmath and hence, in particular,
@xmath . Thus, we infer the first inequality in the lemma.

If @xmath is of class @xmath , ( 3.3 ) certainly holds if @xmath . If
@xmath , instead, let @xmath be the closest point in @xmath to @xmath
and call @xmath the ball of radius @xmath touching @xmath at @xmath and
containing @xmath . Up to a translation, we can always suppose that the
center of the ball @xmath is the origin @xmath . If @xmath is the
solution of ( 1 ) in @xmath , that is @xmath , by comparison we have
that @xmath in @xmath , and hence

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This implies ( 3.3 ), since @xmath . ∎

In the remaining part of this section we present a simple method to
estimate the number @xmath (defined in ( 3.2 )) in a quite general
domain. The following lemma results from a simple inspection and by the
uniqueness for the Dirichlet problem.

###### Lemma 3.2 (Torsional rigidity density in an annulus).

Let @xmath be the annulus centered at the origin and radii @xmath , and
set @xmath .

Then, the solution @xmath of the Dirichlet problem

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is defined for @xmath by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Theorem 3.3 (A bound for the gradient on @xmath, [Mp2]).

Let @xmath be a bounded domain that satisfies the uniform interior and
exterior conditions with radii @xmath and @xmath and let @xmath be a
solution of ( 1 ) in @xmath .

Then, we have that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the diameter of @xmath and @xmath for @xmath and @xmath
for @xmath .

###### Proof.

We first prove the first inequality in ( 3.4 ). Fix any @xmath . Let
@xmath be the interior ball touching @xmath at @xmath and place the
origin of cartesian axes at the center of @xmath .

If @xmath is the solution of ( 1 ) in @xmath , that is @xmath , by
comparison we have that @xmath on @xmath and hence, since @xmath , we
obtain:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

To prove the second inequality, we place the origin of axes at the
center of the exterior ball @xmath touching @xmath at @xmath . Denote by
@xmath the smallest annulus containing @xmath , concentric with @xmath
and having @xmath as internal boundary and let @xmath be the radius of
its external boundary.

If @xmath is the solution of ( 1 ) in @xmath , by comparison we have
that @xmath on @xmath . Moreover, since @xmath , we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By Lemma 3.2 we then compute that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where, for @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Notice that @xmath is bounded since it can be extended to a continuous
function on @xmath . Tedious calculations yield that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Finally, observe that @xmath . ∎

###### Remark 3.4.

(i) Notice that, when @xmath is convex, we can choose @xmath in ( 3.4 )
and obtain

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

(ii) To the best of our knowledge, inequality ( 3.4 ), established in [
MP2 ] , was not present in the literature for general smooth domains.
Other estimates are given in [ PP1 ] for planar strictly convex domains
(but the same argument can be generalized to general dimension for
strictly mean convex domains) and in [ CM ] for strictly mean convex
domains in general dimension. In particular, in [ CM , Lemma 2.2] the
authors prove that there exists a universal constant @xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

#### 3.2 Harmonic functions in weighted spaces

To start, we briefly report on some Hardy-Poincaré-type inequalities for
harmonic functions that are present in the literature. The following
lemma can be deduced from the work of Boas and Straube [ BS ] , which
improves a result of Ziemer [ Zi ] . In what follows, for a set @xmath
and a function @xmath , @xmath denotes the mean value of @xmath in
@xmath that is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Also, for a function @xmath we define

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for @xmath and @xmath .

###### Lemma 3.5 ([Bs]).

Let @xmath , @xmath , be a bounded domain with boundary @xmath of class
@xmath , @xmath , let @xmath be a point in @xmath , and consider @xmath
. Then,

(i) there exists a positive constant @xmath , such that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

for every harmonic function @xmath in @xmath such that @xmath ;

(ii) there exists a positive constant, @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

for every function @xmath which is harmonic in @xmath .

In particular, if @xmath has a Lipschitz boundary, the number @xmath can
be replaced by any exponent in @xmath .

###### Proof.

The assertions (i) and (ii) are easy consequences of a general result of
Boas and Straube (see [ BS ] ). In case (i), we apply [ BS , Example
2.5] ). In case (ii), [ BS , Example 2.1] is appropriate. In fact, [ BS
, Example 2.1] proves ( 3.7 ) for every function @xmath . The addition
of the harmonicity of @xmath in ( 3.7 ) clearly gives a better constant.

The (solvable) variational problems

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

then characterize the two constants. ∎

###### Remark 3.6.

When @xmath we understand the boundary of @xmath to be locally the graph
of a continuous function. In this case, ( 3.6 ) is exactly the result
contained in [ Zi ] . Also, in the case @xmath and @xmath from ( 3.6 )
and ( 3.7 ) we recover the Poincaré-type inequalities proved and used in
[ MP2 ] .

The following corollary describes a couple of applications of the
Hardy-Poincaré inequalities that we have just presented.

###### Corollary 3.7.

Let @xmath , @xmath , be a bounded domain with boundary @xmath of class
@xmath , @xmath , and let @xmath be a harmonic function in @xmath .

(i) If @xmath is a critical point of @xmath in @xmath , then it holds
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

(ii) If

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

then it holds that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

Since @xmath (respectively @xmath ), we can apply ( 3.6 ) (respectively
( 3.7 )) to each first partial derivative @xmath of @xmath , @xmath . If
we raise to the power of @xmath those inequalities and sum over @xmath ,
the conclusion easily follows. ∎

We now present a simple lemma which will be useful in the sequel to
manipulate the left-hand side of Hardy-Poincaré-type inequalities.

###### Lemma 3.8.

Let @xmath be a domain with finite measure and let @xmath be a set of
positive measure. If @xmath , then for every @xmath

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### Proof.

By Hölder’s inequality, we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since @xmath is constant, we then infer that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, ( 3.8 ) follows by an application of the triangular inequality. ∎

Other versions of Hardy-Poincaré inequalities different from those
presented in Lemma 3.5 can be deduced from the work of Hurri-Syrjänen [
H2 ] , which was stimulated by [ BS ] .

In order to state these results, we introduce the notions of @xmath
-John domain and @xmath -John domain with base point @xmath . Roughly
speaking, a domain is a @xmath -John domain (resp. a @xmath -John domain
with base point @xmath ) if it is possible to travel from one point of
the domain to another (resp. from @xmath to another point of the domain)
without going too close to the boundary.

A domain @xmath in @xmath is a @xmath -John domain , @xmath , if each
pair of distinct points @xmath and @xmath in @xmath can be joined by a
curve @xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

A domain @xmath in @xmath is a @xmath -John domain with base point
@xmath , @xmath , if each point @xmath can be joined to @xmath by a
curve @xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is known that, for bounded domains, the two definitions are
quantitatively equivalent (see [ Va , Theorem 3.6] ). The two notions
could be also defined respectively through the so-called @xmath -cigar
and @xmath -carrot properties (see [ Va ] ).

###### Lemma 3.9.

Let @xmath be a bounded @xmath -John domain, and consider three numbers
@xmath such that @xmath , @xmath , @xmath . Then,

(i) there exists a positive constant @xmath , such that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

for every function @xmath which is harmonic in @xmath and such that
@xmath ;

(ii) there exists a positive constant, @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

for every function @xmath which is harmonic in @xmath .

###### Proof.

In [ H2 , Theorem 1.3] it is proved that there exists a constant @xmath
such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

for every @xmath such that @xmath . Here, @xmath denotes the @xmath
-mean of @xmath in @xmath which is defined – following [ IMW ] – as the
unique minimizer of the problem

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Notice that, in the case @xmath , @xmath is the classical mean value of
@xmath in @xmath , i.e. @xmath , as can be easily verified.

By using Lemma 3.8 with @xmath and @xmath we thus prove ( 3.10 ) for
every @xmath such that @xmath . The assumption of the harmonicity of
@xmath in ( 3.10 ) clearly gives a better constant.

Inequality ( 3.9 ) can be deduced from ( 3.10 ) by applying Lemma 3.8
with @xmath and @xmath and recalling that, since @xmath is harmonic, by
the mean value property it holds that @xmath

The (solvable) variational problems

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

then characterize the two constants. ∎

###### Remark 3.10.

When @xmath , ( 3.9 ) and ( 3.10 ) become exactly ( 3.6 ) and ( 3.7 ).
However, it should be noticed that ( 3.6 ) and ( 3.7 ) proved in [ BS ]
also hold true without the restriction @xmath assumed in [ H2 ] .

From Lemma 3.9 we can derive estimates for the derivatives of harmonic
functions, as already done in Corollary 3.7 for Lemma 3.5 .

###### Corollary 3.11.

Let @xmath , @xmath , be a bounded @xmath -John domain and let @xmath be
a harmonic function in @xmath . Consider three numbers @xmath such that
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath .

(i) If @xmath is a critical point of @xmath in @xmath , then it holds
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

(ii) If

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

then it holds that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

Since @xmath (respectively @xmath ), we can apply ( 3.6 ) (respectively
( 3.7 )) to each first partial derivative @xmath of @xmath , @xmath . If
we raise to the power of @xmath those inequalities and sum over @xmath ,
the conclusion easily follows in view of the inequality

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

that holds for every @xmath with @xmath for @xmath , since @xmath . ∎

###### Remark 3.12 (Tracing the geometric dependence of the constants).

In this remark, we explain how to trace the dependence on a few
geometrical parameters of the constants in the relevant inequalities.

(i) The proof of [ H2 ] has the benefit of giving an explicit upper
bound for the constant @xmath appearing in ( 3.11 ), from which, by
following the steps of our proof, we can deduce explicit estimates for
@xmath and @xmath . In fact, we easily show that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

A better estimate for @xmath can be obtained for @xmath -John domains
with base point @xmath . Since the computations are tedious and
technical we present them in Appendix A and here we just report the
final estimate, that is,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

(ii) In the sequel we will also need to trace the dependence on relevant
geometrical quantities of the constants @xmath and @xmath appearing in (
3.7 ) and ( 3.6 ) in the case @xmath .

In [ H1 , Theorem 8.5] , where the author proves ( 3.7 ) in the case
@xmath for @xmath -John domains, an explicit upper bound for @xmath , in
terms of @xmath and @xmath only, can be found. We warn the reader that
the definition of John domain used there is different from the
definitions that we gave in this thesis, but it is equivalent in view of
[ MrS , Theorem 8.5] . Explicitly, by putting together [ H1 , Theorem
8.5] and [ MrS , Theorem 8.5] one finds that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Reasoning as in the proof of ( 3.9 ), from this estimate one can also
deduce a bound for @xmath . In fact, by applying Lemma 3.8 with @xmath
and @xmath and recalling the mean value property of @xmath , from ( 3.7
) and the bound for @xmath , we easily compute that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

A better estimate for @xmath can be obtained for @xmath -John domains
with base point @xmath , that is,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

Complete computations to obtain ( 3.13 ) can be found in Appendix A .

(iii) A domain of class @xmath is obviously a @xmath -John domain and a
@xmath -John domain with base point @xmath for every @xmath . In fact,
by the definitions, it is not difficult to prove the following bounds

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, for @xmath -domains items (i) and (ii) inform us that the
following estimates hold

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

To conclude this section, as a consequence of Lemma 1.5 , we present a
weighted trace inequality. We mention that the following proof modifies
an idea of W. Feldman [ Fe ] for our purposes.

###### Lemma 3.13 (A trace inequality for harmonic functions).

Let @xmath , @xmath , be a bounded domain with boundary @xmath of class
@xmath and let @xmath be a harmonic function in @xmath .

(i) If @xmath is a critical point of @xmath in @xmath , then it holds
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

(ii) If

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

then it holds that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

Since the term @xmath at the left-hand side of ( 1.10 ) can be bounded
from below by @xmath , by an adaptation of Hopf’s lemma (see Theorem 3.3
), it holds that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, the conclusion follows from this last formula, Corollary 3.11 with
@xmath and @xmath , and ( 3.3 ). ∎

#### 3.3 An estimate for the oscillation of harmonic functions

In this section, we single out the key lemma that will produce most of
the stability estimates of Chapter 4 below. It contains an inequality
for the oscillation of a harmonic function @xmath in terms of its @xmath
-norm and of a bound for its gradient. We point out that the following
lemma is new and generalizes the estimates proved and used in [ MP2 ,
MP3 ] for @xmath .

To this aim, we define the parallel set as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Lemma 3.14.

Let @xmath , @xmath , be a bounded domain with boundary @xmath of class
@xmath and let @xmath be a harmonic function in @xmath of class @xmath .
Let @xmath be an upper bound for the gradient of @xmath on @xmath .

Then, there exist two constants @xmath and @xmath depending only on
@xmath and @xmath such that if

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

holds, we have that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Proof.

Since @xmath is harmonic it attains its extrema on the boundary @xmath .
Let @xmath and @xmath be points in @xmath that respectively minimize and
maximize @xmath on @xmath and, for

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

define the two points in @xmath by @xmath , @xmath .

By the fundamental theorem of calculus we have that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath is harmonic and @xmath , @xmath , we can use the mean value
property for the balls with radius @xmath centered at @xmath and obtain:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

after an application of Hölder’s inequality and by the fact that @xmath
. This and ( 3.16 ) then yield that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for every @xmath . Here we used that @xmath attains its maximum on
@xmath , being @xmath harmonic.

Therefore, by minimizing the right-hand side of the last inequality, we
can conveniently choose

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and obtain ( 3.15 ), if @xmath ; ( 3.14 ) will then follow. The explicit
computation immediately shows that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Notice that, the fact that ( 3.15 ) holds if ( 3.14 ) is verified,
remains true even if we replace in ( 3.14 ) and ( 3.15 ) @xmath by any
@xmath . ∎

In the following corollary, we present a geometric sufficient condition
on the domain that makes ( 3.14 ) verified. To this aim, for @xmath
@xmath we denote by @xmath the intrinsic distance of @xmath to @xmath in
@xmath induced by the euclidean metric, that is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Corollary 3.15.

Under the assumptions of Lemma 3.14 , ( 3.14 ) holds true – and hence
also ( 3.15 ) does – if the following inequality is verified

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

for a point @xmath such that @xmath .

###### Proof.

The fact that ( 3.14 ) holds true if ( 3.18 ) is verified follows from
the inequality

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

that can be proved by using the fundamental theorem of calculus. In
fact, if @xmath is any piecewise @xmath curve from @xmath to @xmath ,
the fundamental theorem of calculus informs us that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, we deduce that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and ( 3.19 ) easily follows from the definition of @xmath , since @xmath
. ∎

#### 3.4 Estimates for @xmath

We now turn back our attention to the harmonic function @xmath .

The following lemma is immediate.

###### Lemma 3.16.

Let @xmath be the solution of ( 1 ) and set @xmath , where @xmath is
defined in ( 1.2 ). Then, @xmath is harmonic in @xmath and it holds
that:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

Moreover, if the center @xmath of the polynomial @xmath is chosen in
@xmath , then the oscillation of @xmath on @xmath can be bounded from
below as follows:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

or also:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

if @xmath is of class @xmath .

###### Proof.

Since by a direct computation it is immediate to check that @xmath , the
harmonicity of @xmath follows. Simple and direct computations also give
( 3.20 ). Notice that @xmath on @xmath . Thus, by choosing @xmath in
@xmath , from ( 3.1 ) we get

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence, ( 3.21 ) follows from the inequality @xmath , that holds true
since @xmath .

If @xmath is of class @xmath , ( 3.22 ) follows by noting that @xmath ,
or, if we want, also from ( 3.21 ) and the trivial inequality @xmath . ∎

By exploiting the additional information that we have about @xmath , we
now modify Lemma 3.14 to directly link @xmath to the @xmath -norm of
@xmath . We do it in the following lemma which generalizes to the case
of any @xmath -norm [ MP2 , Lemma 3.3] , that holds for @xmath .

###### Lemma 3.17.

Let @xmath , @xmath , be a bounded domain with boundary of class @xmath
. Set @xmath , where @xmath is the solution of ( 1 ) and @xmath is any
quadratic polynomial as in ( 1.2 ) with @xmath .

Then, there exists a positive constant @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

The constant @xmath depends on @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath . If @xmath is convex the dependence on @xmath can be removed.

###### Proof.

By direct computations it is easy to check that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the maximum of @xmath on @xmath , as defined in ( 3.2 ).
Thus, we can apply Lemma 3.14 with @xmath and @xmath . By means of (
3.22 ) we deduce that ( 3.23 ) holds with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

if

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Here, @xmath and @xmath are the constants defined in ( 3.17 ). On the
other hand, if

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

it is trivial to check that ( 3.23 ) is verified with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, ( 3.23 ) always holds true if we choose the maximum between this
constant and that in ( 3.24 ). We then can easily see that the following
constant will do:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now, by means of ( 3.4 ), we obtain the constant

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If @xmath is convex, the dependence on @xmath can be avoided and we can
choose

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

in light of ( 3.5 ). ∎

For Serrin’s overdetermined problem, Theorem 3.18 below will be crucial.
There, we associate the oscillation of @xmath , and hence @xmath , with
the weighted @xmath -norm of its Hessian matrix.

To this aim, we now choose the center @xmath of the quadratic polynomial
@xmath in ( 1.2 ) to be any critical point of @xmath in @xmath . Notice
that the (global) minimum point of @xmath is always attained in @xmath .
With this choice we have that @xmath . We emphasize that the result that
we present here improves (for every @xmath ) the exponents of estimates
obtained in [ MP3 ] .

###### Theorem 3.18.

Let @xmath , @xmath , be a bounded domain with boundary @xmath of class
@xmath and @xmath be any critical point in @xmath of the solution @xmath
of ( 1 ). Consider the function @xmath , with @xmath given by ( 1.2 ).

There exists a positive constant @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the following specifications:

1.  @xmath ;

2.  @xmath is arbitrarily close to one, in the sense that for any @xmath
    , there exists a positive constant @xmath such that ( 3.25 ) holds
    with @xmath ;

3.  @xmath for @xmath .

The constant @xmath depends on @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , and @xmath (only in the case @xmath ).

###### Proof.

For the sake of clarity, we will always use the letter @xmath to denote
the constants in all the inequalities appearing in the proof. Their
explicit computation will be clear by following the steps of the proof.

(i) Let @xmath . By the Sobolev immersion theorem (see for instance [ Gi
, Theorem 3.12] or [ Ad , Chapter 5] ), we have that there is a constant
@xmath such that, for any @xmath , we have that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

Applying ( 3.7 ) with @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath leads to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since @xmath , we can apply item (i) of Corollary 3.11 with @xmath ,
@xmath , and @xmath to @xmath and obtain that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By using the last inequality together with ( 3.26 ), by choosing @xmath
and noting that @xmath for any @xmath , we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, by recalling ( 3.22 ) we get that ( 3.25 ) holds with @xmath .

(ii) Let @xmath . By applying to the function @xmath ( 3.7 ) with @xmath
, @xmath , @xmath , and item (i) of Corollary 3.11 with @xmath , @xmath
, @xmath , we get

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, by recalling Lemma 3.17 we have that ( 3.25 ) holds true with
@xmath .

(iii) Let @xmath . Since @xmath , we can apply to @xmath item (i) of
Corollary 3.11 with @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and obtain that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Being @xmath , we can apply ( 3.10 ) with @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , and get

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and by Lemma 3.17 we get that ( 3.25 ) holds with @xmath . ∎

###### Remark 3.19 (On the constant @xmath).

The constant @xmath can be shown to depend only on the parameters
mentioned in the statement of Theorem 3.18 . In fact, the parameters
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , can be estimated by using item (iii)
of Remark 3.12 . To remove the dependence on the volume, then one can
use the trivial bound

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We recall that if @xmath has the strong local Lipschitz property (for
the definition see [ Ad , Section 4.5] ), the immersion constant (that
we used in the proof of item (i) of Theorem 3.18 ) depends only on
@xmath and the two Lipschitz parameters of the definition (see [ Ad ,
Chapter 5] ). In our case @xmath is of class @xmath , hence obviously it
has the strong local Lipschitz property and the two Lipschitz parameters
can be easily estimated in terms of @xmath .

In the case of Alexandrov’s Soap Bubble Theorem, we have to deal with (
1.14 ) or ( 1.15 ), where just the unweighted @xmath -norm of the
Hessian of @xmath appears. Thus, the appropriate result in this case is
Theorem 3.20 below, in which we improve (for every @xmath ) the
exponents of estimates obtained in [ MP2 ] .

###### Theorem 3.20.

Let @xmath , @xmath , be a bounded domain with boundary @xmath of class
@xmath and @xmath be any critical point in @xmath of the solution @xmath
of ( 1 ). Consider the function @xmath , with @xmath given by ( 1.2 ).

There exists a positive constant @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the following specifications:

1.  @xmath for @xmath or @xmath ;

2.  @xmath is arbitrarily close to one, in the sense that for any @xmath
    , there exists a positive constant @xmath such that ( 3.27 ) holds
    with @xmath ;

3.  @xmath for @xmath .

The constant @xmath depends on @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , and @xmath (only in the case @xmath ).

###### Proof.

As done in the proof of Theorem 3.18 , for the sake of clarity, we will
always use the letter @xmath to denote the constants in all the
inequalities appearing in the proof. Their explicit computation will be
clear by following the steps of the proof. By reasoning as described in
Remark 3.19 , one can easily check that those constants depend only on
the geometric parameters of @xmath mentioned in the statement of the
theorem.

(i) Let @xmath or @xmath . By the Sobolev immersion theorem (see for
instance [ Gi , Theorem 3.12] or [ Ad , Chapter 5] ), we have that there
is a constant @xmath such that, for any @xmath , we have that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is any number in @xmath for @xmath and @xmath for @xmath .

Since @xmath , we can apply item (i) of Corollary 3.7 with @xmath and
@xmath to @xmath and obtain that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using this last inequality together with ( 3.7 ) with @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , leads to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence, by using ( 3.28 ) with @xmath and noting that @xmath for any
@xmath , we get that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, by recalling ( 3.22 ) we get that ( 3.27 ) holds with @xmath .

(ii) Let @xmath . By applying ( 3.7 ) with @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
and item (i) of Corollary 3.11 with @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , for
@xmath we get

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, by Lemma 3.17 we conclude that ( 3.27 ) holds with @xmath .

(iii) Let @xmath . Applying ( 3.10 ) with @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and
item (i) of Corollary 3.11 with @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , by choosing
@xmath we get that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By Lemma 3.17 , we have that ( 3.27 ) holds true with @xmath . ∎

###### Remark 3.21.

The parameter @xmath is used only to give an estimate of the parameters
@xmath and @xmath in terms of an explicit geometrical quantity.

Moreover, in case @xmath is convex, by using @xmath we are able to
completely remove the dependence of the constants on @xmath . Indeed, in
this case @xmath has a unique minimum point @xmath in @xmath , since
@xmath is analytic and the level sets of @xmath are convex by a result
in [ Ko ] (see [ MaS ] , for a similar argument), and hence we have only
one choice for the point @xmath . Thus, an estimate of @xmath from below
can be obtained, first, by putting together arguments in [ BMS , Lemma
2.6] and [ BMS , Remark 2.5] , to obtain that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Secondly, if we set @xmath to be a point in @xmath such that @xmath , by
recalling Lemma 3.1 we easily find that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

All in all, we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, if @xmath is convex, we can affirm that the constants @xmath ,
appearing in Theorems 3.18 and 3.20 , depend on @xmath , @xmath , and
@xmath , only. In fact, as already noticed in item (i) of Remark 3.4 ,
in this case also the parameter @xmath can be removed, being @xmath .

Even if @xmath is not convex, the dependence on @xmath can still be
removed in some other cases. In fact, we can do it by choosing the point
@xmath appearing in ( 1.2 ) differently, as explained in the following
remark.

###### Remark 3.22.

(i) We can choose @xmath as the center of mass of @xmath . In fact, if
@xmath is the center of mass of @xmath , we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, we can use item (ii) of Corollaries 3.7 , 3.11 instead of item
(i). In this way, in the estimates of Theorems 3.18 and 3.20 we simply
obtain the same constants with @xmath and @xmath replaced by @xmath and
@xmath . Thus, we removed the presence of @xmath and hence the
dependence on @xmath .

It should be noticed that, in this case the extra assumption that @xmath
is needed, since we want that the ball @xmath be contained in @xmath .

(ii) As done in [ Fe ] , another possible way to choose @xmath is @xmath
, where @xmath is any point such that @xmath . In fact, we obtain that
@xmath and we can thus use ( 3.6 ) and ( 3.9 ), with @xmath and @xmath
replaced by @xmath and @xmath . Thus, by recalling item (iii) of Remark
3.12 it is clear that we removed the dependence on @xmath in our
constants that, as already noticed, comes from the estimation of the
parameters @xmath and @xmath .

As in item (i), we should additionally require that @xmath , to be sure
that the ball @xmath be contained in @xmath .

### Chapter 4 Stability results

In this chapter, we collect our results on the stability of the
spherical configuration by putting together the identities derived in
Chapter 1 and the estimates obtained in Chapter 3 .

#### 4.1 Stability for Serrin’s overdetermined problem

In light of ( 3.20 ), ( 1.7 ) can be rewritten in terms of the harmonic
function @xmath , as stated in the following.

###### Lemma 4.1.

Under the same assumptions of Theorem 1.3 , if we set @xmath , then it
holds that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### Proof.

Simple computations give that @xmath . By using this identity and ( 3.20
), ( 4.1 ) easily follows from ( 1.7 ). ∎

In light of ( 3.3 ), Theorem 3.18 gives an estimate from below of the
left-hand side of ( 4.1 ). Now, we will take care of its right-hand side
and prove our main result for Serrin’s problem. The result that we
present here, improves (for every @xmath ) the exponents in the estimate
obtained in [ MP3 , Theorem 1.1] .

###### Theorem 4.2 (Stability for Serrin’s problem).

Let @xmath , @xmath , be a bounded domain with boundary @xmath of class
@xmath and @xmath be the constant defined in ( 1.1 ). Let @xmath be the
solution of problem ( 1 ) and @xmath be any of its critical points.

There exists a positive constant @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

with the following specifications:

1.  @xmath ;

2.  @xmath is arbitrarily close to one, in the sense that for any @xmath
    , there exists a positive constant @xmath such that ( 4.2 ) holds
    with @xmath ;

3.  @xmath for @xmath .

The constant @xmath depends on @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , and @xmath (only in the case @xmath ).

###### Proof.

We have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

after an an application of Hölder’s inequality. Thus, by item (i) of
Lemma 3.13 with @xmath , ( 4.1 ), and this inequality, we infer that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and hence

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

by Lemma 3.1 . These inequalities and Theorem 3.18 then give the desired
conclusion.

We recall that @xmath appearing in the constant in the last inequality
can be estimated in terms of @xmath and @xmath , by proceeding as
described in Remark 3.19 . The ratio @xmath can be estimated (from
above) in terms of @xmath – just by using the isoperimetric inequality;
in turn, @xmath can be bounded in terms of @xmath by proceeding as
described in Remark 3.19 . Finally, as usual, @xmath can be estimated by
means of ( 3.4 ). ∎

If we want to measure the deviation of @xmath from @xmath in @xmath
-norm, we get a smaller (reduced by one half) stability exponent. The
following result improves [ MP3 , Theorem 3.6] .

###### Theorem 4.3 (Stability with @xmath-deviation).

Theorem 4.2 still holds with ( 4.2 ) replaced by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

Instead of applying Hölder’s inequality to the right-hand side of ( 4.1
), we just use the rough bound:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

since @xmath on @xmath . The conclusion then follows from similar
arguments. ∎

###### Remark 4.4.

If @xmath is convex, in view of Remark 3.21 we can claim that the
constants @xmath of Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 depend only on @xmath , @xmath
, @xmath (and @xmath only in the case @xmath ).

The dependence of @xmath on @xmath can be removed also in the cases
described in Remark 3.22 . Regarding the case described in item (i) of
that remark, we notice that, since in that situation @xmath is chosen as
the center of mass of @xmath , in the proof of Theorem 4.2 we will use
item (ii) of Lemma 3.13 instead of item (i), so that @xmath will be
replaced by @xmath .

Since the estimates in Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 do not depend on the
particular critical point chosen, as a corollary, we obtain results of
closeness to a union of balls: here, we just illustrate the instance of
Theorem 4.2 .

###### Corollary 4.5 (Closeness to an aggregate of balls).

Let @xmath , @xmath and @xmath be as in Theorem 4.2 . Then, there exist
points @xmath in @xmath , @xmath , and corresponding numbers

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Here, the exponent @xmath and the constant @xmath are those of Theorem
4.2 .

The number @xmath can be chosen as the number of connected components of
the set @xmath of all the local minimum points of the solution @xmath of
( 1 ).

###### Proof.

We pick one point @xmath from each connected component of the set of
local minimum points of @xmath . By applying Theorem 4.2 to each @xmath
, the conclusion is then evident. ∎

###### Remark 4.6.

The estimates presented in Theorems 4.2 , 4.3 may be interpreted as
stability estimates, once that we fixed some a priori bounds on the
relevant parameters: here, we just illustrate the case of Theorem 4.2 .
Given three positive constants @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath , let @xmath
be the class of bounded domains @xmath with boundary of class @xmath ,
such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then, for every @xmath , we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is that appearing in ( 4.2 ) and @xmath is a constant
depending on @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath (and @xmath only in the
case @xmath ).

If we relax the a priori assumption that @xmath (in particular if we
remove the lower bound @xmath ), it may happen that, as the deviation
@xmath tends to @xmath , @xmath tends to the ideal configuration of two
or more disjoint balls, while @xmath diverges since @xmath tends to
@xmath . The configuration of more balls connected with tiny (but
arbitrarily long) tentacles has been quantitatively studied in [ BNST ]
.

#### 4.2 Stability for Alexandrov’s Soap Bubble Theorem

This section is devoted to the stability issue for the Soap Bubble
Theorem.

As already noticed, in light of ( 3.20 ), ( 1.15 ) can be rewritten in
terms of @xmath , as stated in the following.

###### Lemma 4.7.

Under the same assumptions of Theorem 1.7 , if we set @xmath , then it
holds that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Next, we derive the following lemma, that parallels and is a useful
consequence of Lemma 3.13 .

###### Lemma 4.8.

Let @xmath , @xmath , be a bounded domain with boundary @xmath of class
@xmath . Denote by @xmath the mean curvature of @xmath and let @xmath be
the constant defined in ( 1.1 ).

Then, the following inequality holds:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### Proof.

Discarding the first summand on the left-hand side of ( 4.4 ) and
applying Hölder’s inequality on its right-hand side gives that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

since @xmath and @xmath on @xmath . Thus, inequality ( 4.3 ) implies
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

from which ( 4.5 ) follows at once. ∎

We are now ready to prove our main result for Alexandrov’s Soap Bubble
Theorem. The result that we present here, improves (for every @xmath )
the exponents of estimates obtained in [ MP3 , Theorem 1.2] .

###### Theorem 4.9 (Stability for the Soap Bubble Theorem).

Let @xmath and let @xmath be a surface of class @xmath , which is the
boundary of a bounded domain @xmath . Denote by @xmath the mean
curvature of @xmath and let @xmath be the constant defined in ( 1.1 ).

Then, for some point @xmath there exists a positive constant @xmath such
that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

with the following specifications:

1.  @xmath for @xmath or @xmath ;

2.  @xmath is arbitrarily close to one, in the sense that for any @xmath
    , there exists a positive constant @xmath such that ( 4.6 ) holds
    with @xmath ;

3.  @xmath for @xmath .

The constant @xmath depends on @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , and @xmath (only in the case @xmath ).

###### Proof.

As before, we choose @xmath to be any local minimum point of @xmath in
@xmath . Discarding the second summand on the left-hand side of ( 4.4 )
and applying Hölder’s inequality on its right-hand side, as in the
previous proof, gives that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the second inequality follows from Lemma 4.8 .

The conclusion then follows from Theorem 3.20 . ∎

###### Remark 4.10.

Estimates similar to those of Theorem 4.9 can also be obtained as a
direct corollary of Theorem 4.2 , by means of ( 4.5 ). As it is clear,
in this way the exponents @xmath would be worse than those obtained in
Theorem 4.9 .

We now present a stability result with a weaker deviation (at the cost
of getting a smaller stability exponent), analogous to Theorem 4.3 . To
this aim, we notice that from ( 1.14 ) and ( 3.20 ) we can easily deduce
the following inequality

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

(here, we use the positive and negative part functions @xmath and @xmath
). That inequality tells us that, if we have an a priori bound @xmath
for @xmath on @xmath , then its left-hand side is small if the integral

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is also small. In particular, if @xmath is not too much smaller than
@xmath , then it cannot be too much larger than @xmath and the
Cauchy-Schwarz deficit cannot be too large.

It is clear that,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is a deviation weaker than @xmath .

The result that we present here, improves (for every @xmath ) the
estimates obtained in [ MP2 , Theorem 4.1] .

###### Theorem 4.11 (Stability with @xmath-type deviation).

Theorem 4.9 still holds with ( 4.6 ) replaced by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

From ( 4.7 ), we infer that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The conclusion then follows from Theorem 3.20 . ∎

###### Remark 4.12.

(i) If @xmath is convex, the dependence of the constants @xmath in
Theorems 4.9 and 4.11 can be reduced to the parameters @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath (and @xmath only in the case @xmath ), as described in Remark
3.21 . The dependence on the parameter @xmath can be removed also in the
cases described in Remark 3.22 .

(ii) Results of closeness to a union of balls analogous to Corollary 4.5
can be easily derived also for Theorems 4.9 and 4.11 .

###### Remark 4.13.

The estimates presented in Theorems 4.9 , 4.11 may be interpreted as
stability estimates, once some a priori information is available: here,
we just illustrate the case of Theorem 4.9 . Given three positive
constants @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath , let @xmath be the class of
connected surfaces @xmath of class @xmath , where @xmath is the boundary
of a bounded domain @xmath , such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then, for every @xmath we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is that appearing in ( 4.6 ) and the constant @xmath
depends on @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath (and @xmath only in the
case @xmath ).

If we relax the a priori assumption that @xmath (in particular if we
remove the lower bound @xmath ), it may happen that, as the deviation
@xmath tends to @xmath , @xmath tends to the ideal configuration of two
or more mutually tangent balls, while @xmath diverges since @xmath tends
to @xmath . Such a configuration can be observed, for example, as limit
of sets created by truncating (and then smoothly completing) unduloids
with very thin necks. This phenomenon (called bubbling) has been
quantitatively studied in [ CM ] by considering strictly mean convex
surfaces and by using the uniform deviation @xmath .

#### 4.3 Quantitative bounds for an asymmetry

Another consequence of Lemma 4.8 is the following inequality that shows
an optimal stability exponent for any @xmath . The number @xmath ,
defined as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

is some sort of asymmetry similar to the so-called Fraenkel asymmetry
(see [ Fr ] ). Here, @xmath denotes the symmetric difference of @xmath
and @xmath , and @xmath is the constant defined in ( 1.1 ).

###### Theorem 4.14 (Stability by asymmetry, [Mp3]).

Let @xmath and let @xmath be a surface of class @xmath , which is the
boundary of a bounded domain @xmath . Denote by @xmath the mean
curvature of @xmath and let @xmath be the constant defined in ( 1.1 ).

Then it holds that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

for some positive constant @xmath .

###### Proof.

We use [ Fe , inequality (2.14)] : we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is a ball of radius @xmath (as defined in ( 1.1 )) and
centered at the point @xmath described in item (ii) of Remark 3.22 .
Hence, we obtain that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

by the definition ( 4.8 ). Thus, thanks to ( 4.5 ), we obtain ( 4.9 ).

Here, if we estimate @xmath as described in item (iii) of Remark 3.12 ,
we can see that @xmath depends on @xmath . ∎

###### Remark 4.15 (On the asymmetry @xmath).

Notice that, for any @xmath , we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and @xmath . Thus, if @xmath remains bounded and @xmath tends to @xmath
, then the ratio @xmath does it too.

The converse is not true in general. For example, consider a lollipop
made by a ball and a stick with fixed length @xmath and vanishing width;
as that width vanishes, the ratio @xmath remains bounded, while @xmath
tends to zero and @xmath .

If we fix @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath , we have the following result.

###### Theorem 4.16 ([Mp3]).

Let @xmath , @xmath , be a bounded domain satisfying the uniform
interior and exterior sphere conditions with radii @xmath and @xmath ,
and set @xmath .

Then, we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

Let @xmath be any point in @xmath . It is clear that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

If that maximum is @xmath , at a point @xmath where the ball centered at
@xmath with radius @xmath touches @xmath , we consider the interior
touching ball @xmath .

If @xmath then @xmath and hence

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If, else, @xmath , @xmath contains a ball of radius @xmath still
touching @xmath at @xmath . Such a ball is contained in @xmath , and
hence

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, we proved that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

If, else, the maximum in ( 4.10 ) is @xmath , we proceed similarly, by
reasoning on the exterior ball @xmath and @xmath , and we obtain ( 4.11
) with @xmath replaced by @xmath .

Thus, by recalling that @xmath , it always holds that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

from which, since @xmath was arbitrarily chosen in @xmath , we deduce
that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

On the other hand, if

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

it is trivial to check that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

holds. Thus, we deduce that

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

By proceeding as described at the end of the proof of Theorem 4.2 , we
can easily obtain the estimate @xmath , from which the conclusion easily
follows. ∎

###### Remark 4.17.

Theorem 4.16 and ( 4.9 ) give the inequality

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

that, for any @xmath , is poorer than that obtained in Theorem 4.9 .

#### 4.4 Other related stability results

If we suppose that @xmath is mean convex, then we can use Theorem 1.8 to
obtain a stability result for Heintze-Karcher inequality.

The following theorem improves (for every @xmath ) the exponents
obtained in [ MP2 , Theorem 4.5] .

###### Theorem 4.18 (Stability for Heintze-Karcher’s inequality).

Let @xmath be a surface of class @xmath , which is the boundary of a
bounded domain @xmath , @xmath . Denote by @xmath its mean curvature and
suppose that @xmath on @xmath .

Then, there exist a point @xmath and a positive constant @xmath such
that

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.12)
  -- -- -- --------

with the following specifications:

1.  @xmath for @xmath or @xmath ;

2.  @xmath is arbitrarily close to one, in the sense that for any @xmath
    , there exists a positive constant @xmath such that ( 4.12 ) holds
    with @xmath ;

3.  @xmath for @xmath .

The constant @xmath depends on @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , and @xmath (only in the case @xmath ).

###### Proof.

As before, we choose @xmath be any local minimum point of @xmath in
@xmath . Moreover, by ( 1.17 ) and ( 1.21 ), we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, the conclusion follows from Theorem 3.20 . ∎

Since the deficit of Heintze-Karcher’s inequality can be written as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the solution of ( 1 ), Theorem 4.18 also gives a
stability estimate for the overdetermined boundary value problem
mentioned in item (ii) of Theorem 1.14 , as stated next. It is clear
that the deviation @xmath is weaker than @xmath . The following theorem
improves [ MP2 , Theorem 4.8] .

###### Theorem 4.19 (Stability for a related overdetermined problem).

Let @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath be as in Theorem 4.18 . Let @xmath be
the solution of problem ( 1 ) and @xmath be any of its critical points.

There exists a positive constant @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the following specifications:

1.  @xmath for @xmath or @xmath ;

2.  @xmath is arbitrarily close to one, in the sense that for any @xmath
    , there exists a positive constant @xmath such that ( 4.13 ) holds
    with @xmath ;

3.  @xmath for @xmath .

The constant @xmath depends on @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , and @xmath (only in the case @xmath ).

###### Remark 4.20.

It is clear that analogs of items (i) and (ii) of Remark 4.12 hold also
for Theorems 4.18 and 4.19 .

### Appendix A

#### a.1 Hardy-Poincaré inequalities for @xmath-John domains

In the present appendix, we show how to prove the estimates given in (
3.12 ) and ( 3.13 ).

As already mentioned in the proof of Lemma 3.9 , [ H2 , Theorem 1.3]
states that if @xmath is a @xmath -John domain, then there exists a
constant @xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for every @xmath such that @xmath . Moreover, that proof, which exploits
the so-called Whitney decomposition, informs us that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In order to prove ( 3.12 ), we have to look deeper into that proof. More
technically, a careful inspection of the proof of [ H2 , Theorem 1.3]
will see that also the following result is proved there (even if not
explicitly stated).

###### Theorem A.1 ([H2]).

Let @xmath be a @xmath -John domain in @xmath with base point @xmath ,
and consider three numbers @xmath such that @xmath , @xmath , @xmath .
There exists a constant @xmath such that, for any function @xmath with
@xmath , it holds that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is any cube centered at @xmath with @xmath .

Now we are ready to prove the following lemma, which clearly gives (
3.12 ). We mention that the following lemma generalizes the result
obtained in [ Fe , Lemma 8] in the particular case @xmath .

###### Lemma A.2.

Let @xmath be a @xmath -John domain in @xmath with base point @xmath ,
and consider three numbers @xmath such that @xmath , @xmath , @xmath .
Then, for every harmonic function @xmath such that @xmath it holds that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for a constant @xmath

###### Proof.

To simplify formulas, in all the inequalities of the proof we will
always use the letter @xmath to denote the constants depending only on
@xmath .

If we consider

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we have that @xmath . Since @xmath is harmonic and @xmath we have by the
mean value property, @xmath . The usual (i.e., unweighted) Poincaré
inequality in @xmath informs us that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By using the above estimate and Theorem A.1 we get that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In the last inequality we used two facts: the first is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

that can be easily verified by using the definition of @xmath -John
domain with base point @xmath with a point @xmath such that @xmath ; the
second is that, being @xmath , we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

since by the assumptions we know that @xmath and @xmath . ∎

In an analogous way, we can also prove ( 3.13 ). In fact, an inspection
of the proof of [ H1 , Theorem 8.5] will see that the following result
is proved there (even if not explicitly stated).

###### Theorem A.3 ([H1]).

Let @xmath be a @xmath -John domain in @xmath with base point @xmath ,
and let @xmath . Then, for every function @xmath , it holds that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is any cube centered at @xmath with @xmath .

Thus, by proceeding as in Lemma A.2 , we can now prove ( 3.13 ). We do
it in the following lemma.

###### Lemma A.4.

Let @xmath be a @xmath -John domain in @xmath with base point @xmath ,
and let @xmath . Then, for every harmonic function @xmath such that
@xmath it holds that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Proof.

If we consider

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we have that @xmath . Since @xmath is harmonic and @xmath we have by the
mean value property, @xmath . The usual (i.e., unweighted) Poincaré
inequality in @xmath informs us that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By using the above estimate and Theorem A.3 we get that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In the last inequality we used two facts: the first is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which follows by using ( A.1 ) together with the inequality

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

that holds trivially since @xmath and @xmath . The second is the trivial
observation that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

since @xmath . ∎

  Abstract. These notes record the lectures for the CIME Summer Course
  taught by the first author in Cetraro during the week of June 19-23,
  2017. The notes contain the proofs of several results on the
  classification of stable solutions to some nonlinear elliptic
  equations. The results are crucial steps within the regularity theory
  of minimizers to such problems. We focus our attention on three
  different equations, emphasizing that the techniques and ideas in the
  three settings are quite similar.
  The first topic is the stability of minimal cones. We prove the
  minimality of the Simons cone in high dimensions, and we give almost
  all details in the proof of J. Simons on the flatness of stable
  minimal cones in low dimensions.
  Its semilinear analogue is a conjecture on the Allen-Cahn equation
  posed by E. De Giorgi in 1978. This is our second problem, for which
  we discuss some results, as well as an open problem in high dimensions
  on the saddle-shaped solution vanishing on the Simons cone.
  The third problem was raised by H. Brezis around 1996 and concerns the
  boundedness of stable solutions to reaction-diffusion equations in
  bounded domains. We present proofs on their regularity in low
  dimensions and discuss the main open problem in this topic.
  Moreover, we briefly comment on related results for harmonic maps,
  free boundary problems, and nonlocal minimal surfaces.

The abstract above gives an account of the topics treated in these
lecture notes.

#### 2.1 Minimal cones

In this section we discuss two classical results on the theory of
minimal surfaces: Simons flatness result on stable minimal cones in low
dimensions and the Bombieri-De Giorgi-Giusti counterexample in high
dimensions. The main purpose of these lecture notes is to present the
main ideas and computations leading to these deep results – and to
related ones in subsequent sections. Therefore, to save time for this
purpose, we do not consider the most general classes of sets or
functions (defined through weak notions), but instead we assume them to
be regular enough.

Throughout the notes, for certain results we will refer to three other
expositions: the books of Giusti [ 28 ] and of Colding and Minicozzi [
16 ] , and the CIME lecture notes of Cozzi and Figalli [ 17 ] . The
notes [ 13 ] by the first author and Capella have a similar spirit to
the current ones and may complement them.

###### Definition 2.1 (Perimeter).

Let @xmath be an open set, regular enough. For a given open ball @xmath
we define the perimeter of @xmath in @xmath as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath denotes the @xmath -dimensional Hausdorff measure (see
Figure 2.1 ).

The interested reader can learn from [ 28 , 17 ] a more general notion
of perimeter (defined by duality or in a weak sense) and the concept of
set of finite perimeter.

###### Definition 2.2 (Minimal set).

We say that an open set (regular enough) @xmath is a minimal set (or a
set of minimal perimeter ) if and only if, for every given open ball
@xmath , it holds that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for every open set @xmath (regular enough) such that @xmath .

In other words, @xmath has least perimeter in @xmath among all (regular)
sets which agree with @xmath outside @xmath .

To proceed, one considers small perturbations of a given set @xmath and
computes the first and second variations of the perimeter functional .
To this end, let @xmath be a one-parameter family of maps @xmath such
that @xmath is the identity @xmath and all the maps @xmath have compact
support (uniformly) contained in @xmath .

Consider the sets @xmath . We are interested in the perimeter functional
@xmath . One proceeds by choosing @xmath , which shifts the original set
@xmath in the normal direction @xmath to its boundary. Here @xmath is
the outer normal to @xmath and is extended in a neighborhood of @xmath
to agree with the gradient of the signed distance function to @xmath ,
as in [ 28 ] or in our Subsection 2.1.3 below. On the other hand, @xmath
is a scalar function with compact support in @xmath (see Figure 2.2 ).

It can be proved (see chapter 10 of [ 28 ] ) that the first and second
variations of perimeter are given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.1)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the mean curvature of @xmath at @xmath and @xmath is the
sum of the squares of the @xmath principal curvatures @xmath of @xmath
at @xmath . More precisely,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In ( 2.2 ), @xmath (sometimes denoted by @xmath ) is the tangential
gradient to the surface @xmath , given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

for any function @xmath defined in a neighborhood of @xmath . Here
@xmath is the usual Euclidean gradient and @xmath is always the normal
vector to @xmath . Being @xmath the tangential gradient, one can check
that @xmath depends only on @xmath . It can be therefore computed for
functions @xmath defined only on @xmath (and not necessarily in a
neighborhood of @xmath ).

###### Definition 2.3.

1.  We say that @xmath is a minimal surface (or a stationary surface )
    if the first variation of perimeter vanishes for all balls @xmath .
    Equivalently, by ( 2.1 ), @xmath on @xmath .

2.  We say that @xmath is a stable minimal surface if @xmath and the
    second variation of perimeter is nonnegative for all balls @xmath .

3.  We say that @xmath is a minimizing minimal surface if @xmath is a
    minimal set as in Definition 2.2 .

We warn the reader that in some books or articles “minimal surface” may
mean “minimizing minimal surface”.

###### Remark 2.4.

1.  If @xmath is a minimal surface (i.e., @xmath ), the second variation
    of perimeter ( 2.2 ) becomes

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (2.4)
      -- -------- -- -------

2.  If @xmath is a minimizing minimal surface, then @xmath is a stable
    minimal surface. In fact, in this case the function @xmath has a
    global minimum at @xmath .

##### 2.1.1 The Simons cone. Minimality

###### Definition 2.5 (The Simons cone).

The Simons cone @xmath is the set

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

In what follows we will also use the following notation:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let us consider the open set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and notice that @xmath (see Figure 2.3 ).

###### Exercise 2.1.

Prove that the Simons cone has zero mean curvature for every integer
@xmath . For this, use the following fact (that you may also try to
prove): if

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for some function @xmath , then the mean curvature of @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### Remark 2.6.

It is easy to check that, in @xmath , @xmath is not a minimizing minimal
surface. In fact, referring to Figure 2.4 , the shortest way to go from
@xmath to @xmath is through the straight line. Thus, if we consider as a
competitor in @xmath the interior of the set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the triangle with vertices @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
and @xmath is the symmetric of @xmath with respect to @xmath , we have
that @xmath has less perimeter in @xmath than @xmath .

In 1969 Bombieri, De Giorgi, and Giusti proved the following result.

###### Theorem 2.7 (Bombieri-De Giorgi-Giusti [5]).

If @xmath , then @xmath is a minimal set in @xmath . That is, if @xmath
, the Simons cone @xmath is a minimizing minimal surface.

The following is a clever proof of Theorem 2.7 found in 2009 by G. De
Philippis and E. Paolini ( [ 23 ] ). It is based on a calibration
argument . Let us first define

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

clearly we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let us also consider the vector field

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

###### Exercise 2.2.

Check that if @xmath , @xmath has the same sign as @xmath in @xmath .

###### Proof of Theorem 2.7.

By Exercise 2.2 we know that if @xmath , @xmath has the same sign as
@xmath , where @xmath and @xmath are defined in ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ). Let
@xmath be a competitor for @xmath in a ball @xmath , with @xmath regular
enough. We have that @xmath .

Set @xmath (see Figure 2.5 ). By using the fact that @xmath in @xmath
and the divergence theorem, we deduce that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

Since @xmath on @xmath , and @xmath (since in fact @xmath ) everywhere
(and hence in particular on @xmath ), from ( 2.9 ) we conclude

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

With the same reasoning it is easy to prove that ( 2.10 ) holds also for
@xmath . Putting both inequalities together, we conclude that @xmath .

Notice that the proof works for competitors @xmath which are regular
enough (since we applied the divergence theorem). However, it can be
generalized to very general competitors by using the generalized
definition of perimeter, as in [ 23 , Theorem 1.5] . ∎

Theorem 2.7 can also be proved with another argument – but still very
much related to the previous one and that also uses the function @xmath
. It consists of going to one more dimension @xmath and working with the
minimal surface equation for graphs, ( 2.11 ) below. This is done in
Theorem 16.4 of [ 28 ] (see also the proof of Theorem 2.2 in [ 13 ] ).

In the proof above we used a vector field @xmath satisfying the
following three properties (with @xmath ):

1.  @xmath in @xmath and @xmath in @xmath ;

2.  @xmath on @xmath ;

3.  @xmath in @xmath .

###### Definition 2.8 (Calibration).

If @xmath satisfies the three properties above we say that @xmath is a
calibration for @xmath in @xmath .

###### Exercise 2.3.

Use a similar argument to that of our last proof and build a calibration
to show that a hyperplane in @xmath is a minimizing minimal surface.

In an appendix, and with the purpose that the reader gets acquainted
with another calibration, we present one which solves the isoperimetric
problem: balls minimize perimeter among sets of given volume in @xmath .
Note that the first variation (or Euler-Lagrange equation) for this
problem is, by Lagrange multipliers, @xmath , where @xmath is a
constant.

The following is an alternative proof of Theorem 2.7 . It uses a
foliation argument , as explained below. This second proof is probably
more transparent (or intuitive) than the previous one and it is used
often in minimal surfaces theory, but requires to know the existence of
a (regular enough) minimizer (something that was not necessary in the
previous proof). This existence result is available and can be proved
with tools of the Calculus of Variations (see [ 17 , 28 ] ).

The proof also requires the use of the following important fact. If
@xmath , @xmath are two connected hypersurfaces (regular enough), both
satisfying @xmath , and such that @xmath and @xmath lies on one side of
@xmath , then @xmath in @xmath . Lying on one side can be defined as
@xmath , @xmath , and @xmath . The same result holds if @xmath satisfies
@xmath and @xmath satisfies @xmath .

This result can be proved writing both surfaces as graphs in a
neighborhood of a common point @xmath . The minimal surface equation
@xmath then becomes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

for @xmath such that @xmath is a piece of @xmath (after a rotation and
translation). Then, assuming that @xmath also satisfies ( 2.11 ) – or
the appropriate inequality –, one can see that @xmath is a
(super)solution of a second order linear elliptic equation. Since @xmath
(due to the ordering of @xmath and @xmath ), the strong maximum
principle leads to @xmath (since @xmath at the touching point). See
Section 7 of Chapter 1 of [ 16 ] for more details.

###### Alternative proof (of Theorem 2.7).

Note that the hypersurfaces

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with @xmath , form a foliation of @xmath , where @xmath is the function
defined in ( 2.7 ).

Let @xmath be a minimizer of the perimeter in @xmath among sets that
coincide with @xmath on @xmath , and assume that it is regular enough.
Since @xmath is a minimizer, in particular @xmath is a solution of the
minimal surface equation @xmath . Since @xmath , by ( 2.6 ) and Exercise
2.2 , the leaves of our foliation @xmath are subsolutions of the same
equation for @xmath , and supersolutions for @xmath .

If @xmath , there will be a first leaf (starting either from @xmath or
from @xmath ) @xmath , with @xmath , that touches @xmath at a point in
@xmath that we call @xmath (see Figure 2.6 ).

The point @xmath cannot belong to @xmath , since it holds that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the level sets of @xmath do not intersect each other. Thus, @xmath
must be an interior point of @xmath . But then we arrive at a
contradiction, by the “strong maximum principle” argument commented
right before this proof, applied with @xmath and @xmath .

As an exercise, write the details to prove the existence of a first leaf
touching @xmath at an interior point.

This same foliation argument will be used, in a simpler setting for
graphs and the Allen-Cahn equation, in the proof of Theorem 2.26 in the
next section. ∎

###### Remark 2.9.

The previous foliation argument gives more than the minimality of @xmath
. It gives uniqueness for the Dirichlet (or Plateau) problem associated
to the minimal surface equation with @xmath as boundary value on @xmath
.

###### Remark 2.10.

In our alternative proof of Theorem 2.7 we used a clever foliation made
of subsolutions and supersolutions. This sufficed to prove in a simple
way Theorem 2.7 , but required to (luckily) find the auxiliary function
@xmath . Instead, in [ 5 ] , Bombieri, De Giorgi, and Giusti considered
the foliation made of exact solutions to the minimal surface equation
@xmath , when @xmath . To this end, they proceeded as in the following
exercise and wrote the minimal surface equation, for surfaces with
rotational symmetry in @xmath and in @xmath , as an ODE in @xmath ,
finding Equation ( 2.12 ) below. They then showed that the solutions of
such ODE in the @xmath -plane do not intersect each other (and neither
the Simons cone), and thus form a foliation (see Remark 2.17 for more
information on this).

###### Exercise 2.4.

Let us set @xmath and @xmath for @xmath . Check that the following two
ODEs are equivalent to the minimal surface equation @xmath written in
the @xmath -variables for surfaces with rotational symmetry in @xmath
and in @xmath .

1.  As done in [ 5 ] , if we set a parametric representation @xmath ,
    @xmath , we find

      -- -------- -- --------
         @xmath      (2.12)
      -- -------- -- --------

2.  as done in [ 19 ] , if we set @xmath , @xmath we get

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

The previous ODEs can be found starting from ( 2.6 ) when @xmath depends
only on @xmath and @xmath . Alternatively, they can also be found
computing the first variation of the perimeter functional in @xmath
written in the @xmath -variables:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

for some positive constant @xmath , that becomes

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with the parametrization in point (ii).

###### Remark 2.11.

For @xmath , there exist other minimizing cones, such as some of the
Lawson’s cones , defined by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for @xmath and @xmath . For details, see [ 19 ] .

Notice that if @xmath is a cone (i.e., @xmath for every @xmath ), in the
expressions ( 2.1 ), ( 2.2 ), and ( 2.4 ) we will always consider @xmath
with compact support outside the origin (thus, not changing the possible
singularity of the cone at the origin).

The next theorem was proved by Simons in 1968 ⁴ ⁴ 4 Theorem 2.12 was
proved in 1965 by De Giorgi for @xmath , in 1966 by Almgren for @xmath ,
and finally in 1968 by Simons in any dimension @xmath . (it is Theorem
10.10 in [ 28 ] ). It is a crucial result towards the regularity theory
of minimizing minimal surfaces.

###### Theorem 2.12 (Simons [36]).

Let @xmath be an open set such that @xmath is a stable minimal cone and
@xmath is regular. Thus, we are assuming @xmath and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

for every @xmath with compact support outside the origin.

If @xmath , then @xmath is a hyperplane.

###### Remark 2.13.

Simons result (Theorem 2.12 ), together with a blow-up argument and a
monotonicity formula (as main tools), lead to the flatness of every
minimizing minimal surface in all of @xmath if @xmath (see [ 28 ,
Theorem 17.3] for a proof). The same tools also give the analyticity of
every minimal surface that is minimizing in a given ball of @xmath if
@xmath (see [ 28 , Theorem 10.11] for a detailed proof). See also [ 17 ]
for a great shorter exposition of these results.

The dimension @xmath in Theorem 2.12 is optimal, since by Theorem 2.7
the Simons cone provides a counterexample in dimension @xmath .

The following is a very rough explanation of why the minimizer of the
Dirichlet (or Plateau) problem is the Simons cone (and thus passes
through the origin) in high dimensions – in opposition with low
dimensions, as in Figure 2.4 , where the minimizer stays away from the
origin. In the perimeter functional written in the @xmath -variables (
2.13 ), the Jacobian @xmath becomes smaller and smaller near the origin
as @xmath gets larger. Thus, lengths near @xmath become smaller as the
dimension @xmath increases.

In order to prove Theorem 2.12 , we start with some important
preliminaries. Recalling ( 2.3 ), for @xmath , we define the tangential
derivative

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the exterior normal to @xmath on @xmath , @xmath are
Euclidean partial derivatives, and we used the standard convention of
sum @xmath over repeated indices. As mentioned right after definition (
2.3 ), even if to compute @xmath requires to extend @xmath to a
neighborhood of @xmath , @xmath is well defined knowing @xmath only on
@xmath – since it is a tangential derivative. Note also that we have
@xmath tangential derivatives @xmath and, thus, they are linearly
dependent, since @xmath is @xmath -dimensional. However, it is easy to
check (as an exercise) that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We next define the Laplace-Beltrami operator on @xmath by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

acting on functions @xmath . For the reader knowing Riemannian calculus,
one can check that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the tangential gradient introduced in ( 2.3 ) and @xmath
denotes the (tangential) divergence on the manifold @xmath .

According to ( 2.6 ), we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We will also use the following formula of integration by parts :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

for every (smooth) hypersurface @xmath and @xmath with compact support.
Equation ( 2.16 ) is proved in Giusti’s book [ 28 , Lemma 10.8] .
However, there are two typos in [ 28 , Lemma 10.8] : @xmath is missed in
the identity above, and there is an error of a sign in the proof of [ 28
, Lemma 10.8] .

Replacing @xmath by @xmath in ( 2.16 ), we deduce that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

From this, replacing @xmath by @xmath in ( 2.17 ) and using that @xmath
, we also have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

###### Remark 2.14.

For a minimal surface @xmath , the second variation of perimeter given
by ( 2.4 ) can also be rewritten, after ( 2.18 ), as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The operator @xmath appearing in this expression is called the Jacobi
operator . It is the linearization at the minimal surface @xmath of the
minimal surface equation @xmath .

Towards the proof of Simons theorem, let us now take @xmath in ( 2.14 ),
where @xmath and @xmath are still arbitrary ( @xmath with compact
support outside the origin) and will be chosen later. We obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where at the last step we used integration by parts ( 2.17 ). This leads
to the inequality

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the term @xmath appearing in the first integral is the linearized
or Jacobi operator at @xmath acting on @xmath .

Now we make the choice @xmath and we arrive, as a consequence of
stability, to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

At this point, Simons proof of Theorem 2.12 uses the following
inequality for the Laplace-Beltrami operator @xmath of @xmath (recall
that @xmath is the sum of the squares of the principal curvatures of
@xmath ), in the case when @xmath is a stationary cone.

###### Lemma 2.15 (Simons lemma [36]).

Let @xmath be an open set such that @xmath is a cone with zero mean
curvature and @xmath is regular. Then, @xmath is homogeneous of degree
@xmath and, in @xmath , we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In Subsection 2.1.3 we will give an outline of the proof of this result.
We now use Lemma 2.15 to complete the proof of Theorem 2.12 .

###### Proof of Theorem 2.12.

By using ( 2.19 ) together with Lemma 2.15 we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

for every @xmath with compact support outside the origin. By
approximation, the same holds for @xmath Lipschitz instead of @xmath .

If @xmath , we now choose @xmath to be the Lipschitz function

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By directly computing

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

we realize that if

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

then in ( 2.20 ) we have @xmath . If @xmath were an admissible function
in ( 2.20 ), we would then conclude that @xmath on @xmath . This is
equivalent to @xmath being an hyperplane.

Now, for @xmath to have compact support and hence be admissible, we need
to cut-off @xmath near @xmath and infinity. As an exercise, one can
check that the cut-offs work (i.e., the tails in the integrals tend to
zero) if (and only if)

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

or equivalently, since they have the same homogeneity,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By recalling that the Jacobian on @xmath (in spherical coordinates) is
@xmath , ( 2.21 ), and that, by Lemma 2.15 , @xmath is homogeneous of
degree @xmath , we deduce that ( 2.23 ) is satisfied if @xmath and
@xmath . That is, if

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

If @xmath then @xmath , i.e., @xmath , and thus we can choose @xmath and
@xmath satisfying ( 2.24 ) and ( 2.22 ). It then follows that @xmath ,
and hence @xmath is a hyperplane. ∎

The argument in the previous proof (leading to the dimension @xmath ) is
very much related to a well known result: Hardy’s inequality in @xmath –
which is presented next.

##### 2.1.2 Hardy’s inequality

As already noticed in Remark 2.14 , for a minimal surface @xmath the
second variation of perimeter ( 2.4 ) can also be rewritten, by
integrating by parts, as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This involves the linearized or Jacobi operator @xmath . If @xmath ,
with @xmath , then @xmath (if @xmath is a cone and thus @xmath is
homogeneous of degree @xmath ), where @xmath depends only on the angles
@xmath . Thus, we are in the presence of the “Hardy-type operator”

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

notice that @xmath and @xmath scale in the same way. Thus, for all
admissible functions @xmath ,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Let us analyze the simplest case when @xmath and @xmath . Then, the
validity or not of the previous inequality is given by Hardy’s
inequality, stated and proved next.

###### Proposition 2.16 (Hardy’s inequality).

If @xmath and @xmath , then

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

In addition, @xmath is the best constant in this inequality and it is
not achieved by any @xmath .

Moreover, if @xmath , then the Dirichlet spectrum of @xmath in the unit
ball @xmath goes all the way to @xmath . That is,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the infimum is taken over @xmath .

###### Proof.

Using spherical coordinates, for a given @xmath we can write

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here we integrated by parts, using that @xmath .

Now we apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the right-hand side to
obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

Putting together ( 2.27 ) and ( 2.28 ) we get

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

that is,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By integrating in @xmath we conclude ( 2.25 ). An inspection of the
equality cases in the previous proof shows that the best constant is not
achieved.

Let us now consider @xmath with @xmath . Take

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and cut it off near the origin to be admissible. If we consider the main
terms in the quotient ( 2.26 ), we get

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus it is clear that, as @xmath , the denominator remains finite
independently of the cut-off, while the numerator is as negative as we
want after the cut-off. Hence, the quotient tends to @xmath . ∎

###### Remark 2.17.

As we explained in Remark 2.10 , in [ 5 ] , Bombieri, De Giorgi, and
Giusti used a foliation made of exact solutions to the minimal surface
equation @xmath when @xmath . These are the solutions of the ODE ( 2.12
) starting from points @xmath in the @xmath -axis and with vertical
derivative @xmath . They showed that, for @xmath , they do not intersect
each other, neither intersect the Simons cone @xmath . Instead, in
dimensions @xmath and @xmath they do not produce a foliation and, in
fact, each of them crosses infinitely many times @xmath , as showed in
Figure 2.7 . This reflects the fact that the linearized operator @xmath
on @xmath has infinitely many negative eigenvalues, as in the simpler
situation of Hardy’s inequality in the last statement of Proposition
2.16 .

##### 2.1.3 Proof of the Simons lemma

As promised, in this section we present the proof of Lemma 2.15 with
almost all details. We follow the proof contained in Giusti’s book [ 28
] , where more details can be found (Simons lemma is Lemma 10.9 in [ 28
] ). We point out that in the proof of [ 28 ] there are the following
two typos:

-   as already noticed before, the identity in the statement of [ 28 ,
    Lemma 10.8] is missing @xmath in the second integrand. We wrote the
    corrected identity in equation ( 2.16 ) of these notes;

-   the label (10.18) is missing in line -8, page 122 of [ 28 ] .

Alternative proofs of Lemma 2.15 using intrinsic Riemaniann tensors can
be found in the original paper of Simons [ 36 ] from 1968 and also in
the book of Colding and Minicozzi [ 16 ] .

###### Notation.

We denote by @xmath the signed distance function to @xmath , defined by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

As we are assuming @xmath to be regular, we have that @xmath is @xmath
in a neighborhood of @xmath .

The normal vector to @xmath is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we write

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where we adopt the abbreviated notation

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for partial derivatives in @xmath . As introduced after Theorem 2.12 ,
we will use the tangential derivatives

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for @xmath , and thus

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where we adopted the summation convention over repeated indices.
Finally, recall the Laplace-Beltrami operator defined in ( 2.15 ):

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Remark 2.18.

Since

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

it holds that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which leads to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Exercise 2.5.

Using @xmath , verify that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

The identities

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

will be used often in the following computations. The first one follows
from the definition of @xmath , while the second is immediate from (
2.29 ).

The next lemma will be useful in what follows.

###### Lemma 2.19.

The following equations hold for every smooth hypersurface @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

for all indices @xmath and @xmath .

For a proof of this lemma, see [ 28 , Lemma 10.7] .

Equation ( 2.33 ) is an important one. It says that the normal vector
@xmath to a minimal surface solves the Jacobi equation @xmath on @xmath
. This reflects the invariance of the equation @xmath by translations
(to see this, write a perturbation made by a small translation as a
normal deformation, as in Figure 2.2 ).

If @xmath is stationary, from ( 2.32 ) and by means of simple
calculations, one obtains that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 2.34 ) is the formula with the missed label (10.18) in [ 28 ]
.

We are ready now to give the

###### Outline of the proof (of Lemma 2.15).

By ( 2.30 ) we can write that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Then, using ( 2.33 ), ( 2.34 ), and the fact @xmath , we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and by ( 2.32 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now, if @xmath , we can choose the @xmath -axis to be the same direction
as @xmath . Thus, @xmath and at @xmath we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Hence, computing from now on always at the point @xmath , and by using (
2.32 ) and ( 2.31 ), we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where all the greek indices indicate summation from @xmath to @xmath .

On the other hand, we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and hence

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now remember that @xmath is a cone with vertex at the origin, and thus
@xmath on @xmath . Since we took @xmath at @xmath , we may choose
coordinates in such a way that @xmath lies on the @xmath -axis. In
particular, @xmath at @xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which leads to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If now the letters @xmath run from @xmath to @xmath , he have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

From ( 2.32 ), @xmath and @xmath at @xmath . Since @xmath is a cone,
@xmath is homogeneous of degree 0 and hence @xmath is homogeneous of
degree @xmath . Thus, by Euler’s theorem on homogeneous functions, we
have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and hence

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The proof is now completed. ∎

##### 2.1.4 Comments on: harmonic maps, free boundary problems, and
nonlocal minimal surfaces

Here we briefly sketch arguments and results similar to the previous
ones on minimal surfaces, now for three other elliptic problems.

###### Harmonic maps

Consider the energy

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

for @xmath maps @xmath from a domain @xmath of @xmath into the closed
upper hemisphere

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

A critical point of @xmath is called a (weakly) harmonic map . When a
map minimizes @xmath among all maps with values into @xmath and with
same boundary values on @xmath , then it is called a minimizing harmonic
map.

From the energy ( 2.35 ) and the restriction @xmath , one finds that the
equation for harmonic maps is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In 1983, Jäger and Kaul proved the following theorem, that we state here
without proving it (see the original paper [ 29 ] for the proof).

###### Theorem 2.20 (Jäger-Kaul [29]).

The equator map

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is a minimizing harmonic map on the class

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

if and only if @xmath .

We just mention that the proof of the “if” in Theorem 2.20 uses a
calibration argument.

Later, Giaquinta and Souček [ 27 ] , and independently Schoen and
Uhlenbeck [ 35 ] , proved the following result.

###### Theorem 2.21 (Giaquinta-Souček [27]; Schoen-Uhlenbeck [35]).

Let @xmath be a minimizing harmonic map, homogeneous of degree zero,
into the closed upper hemisphere @xmath . If @xmath , then @xmath is
constant.

Now we will show an outline of the proof of Theorem 2.21 following [ 27
] . More details can also be found in Section 3 of [ 13 ] . This theorem
gives an alternative proof of one part of the statement of Theorem 2.20
. Namely, that the equator map @xmath is not minimizing for @xmath .

###### Outline of the proof (of Theorem 2.21).

After stereographic projection (with respect to the south pole) @xmath
from @xmath to @xmath , for the new function @xmath , the energy ( 2.35
) (up to a constant factor) is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In addition, we have @xmath since the image of @xmath is contained in
the closed upper hemisphere.

By testing the function

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is a smooth radial function with compact support in @xmath
, in the equation of the first variation of the energy, that is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

one can deduce that either @xmath is constant (and then the proof is
finished) or

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

that we assume from now on.

Since @xmath is a minimizer, we have that the second variation of the
energy satisfies

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By choosing here the function

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is a smooth radial function with compact support in @xmath
(to be chosen later), and setting

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

one can conclude the proof by similar arguments as in the previous
section and by using Lemma 2.22 , stated next. ∎

###### Lemma 2.22.

If @xmath is a harmonic map, homogeneous of degree zero, and with @xmath
, we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath .

This lemma is the analogue result of Lemma 2.15 for minimal cones. See [
27 ] for a proof of the lemma, which also follows from Bochner identity
(see [ 35 ] ).

###### Free boundary problems

Consider the one-phase free boundary problem:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is homogeneous of degree one and positive in the domain
@xmath and @xmath is a cone. We are interested in solutions @xmath that
are stable for the Alt-Caffarelli energy functional

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with respect to compact domain deformations that do not contain the
origin. More precisely, we say that @xmath is stable if for any smooth
vector field @xmath with @xmath we have

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

The following result due to Jerison and Savin is contained in [ 30 ] ,
where a detailed proof can be found.

###### Theorem 2.23 (Jerison-Savin [30]).

The only stable, homogeneous of degree one, solutions of ( 2.36 ) in
dimension @xmath are the one-dimensional solutions @xmath , @xmath .

In dimension @xmath this result had been established by Caffarelli,
Jerison, and Kenig [ 14 ] , where they conjectured that it remains true
up to dimension @xmath . On the other hand, in dimension @xmath , De
Silva and Jerison [ 22 ] provided an example of a nontrivial minimizer.

The proof of Jerison and Savin of Theorem 2.23 is similar to Simons
proof of the rigidity of stable minimal cones in low dimensions: they
find functions @xmath (now involving the second derivatives of @xmath )
which satisfy appropriate differential inequalities for the linearized
equation.

Here, the linearized problem is the following:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For the function

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

they found the following interior inequality which is similar to the one
of the Simons lemma:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In addition, they also need to prove a boundary inequality involving
@xmath . Furthermore, to establish Theorem 2.23 in dimension @xmath , a
more involved function @xmath of the second derivatives of @xmath is
needed.

###### Nonlocal minimal surfaces

Nonlocal minimal surfaces, or @xmath -minimal surfaces (where @xmath ),
have been introduced in 2010 in the seminal paper of Caffarelli,
Roquejoffre, and Savin [ 15 ] . These surfaces are connected to
fractional perimeters and diffusions and, as @xmath , they converge to
classical minimal surfaces. We refer to the lecture notes [ 17 ] and the
survey [ 24 ] , where more references can be found.

For @xmath -minimal surfaces and all @xmath , the analogue of Simons
flatness result is only known in dimension @xmath by a result for
minimizers of Savin and Valdinoci [ 34 ] .

#### 2.2 The Allen-Cahn equation

This section concerns the Allen-Cahn equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

By using equation ( 2.37 ) and the maximum principle it can be proved
that any solution satisfies @xmath . Then, by the strong maximum
principle we have that either @xmath or @xmath . Since @xmath are
trivial solutions, from now on we consider @xmath .

We introduce the class of 1-d solutions :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The solution @xmath is sometimes referred to as the layer solution to (
2.37 ); see Figure 2.8 . The fact that @xmath depends only on one
variable can be rephrased also by saying that all the level sets @xmath
of @xmath are hyperplanes.

###### Exercise 2.6.

Check that the @xmath -d functions introduced above are solutions of the
Allen-Cahn equation.

###### Remark 2.24.

Let us take @xmath and consider the 1-d solution @xmath . It is clear
that the following two relations hold:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

The energy functional associated to equation ( 2.37 ) is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the double-well potential in Figure 2.9 :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Definition 2.25 (Minimizer).

A function @xmath is said to be a minimizer of ( 2.37 ) when

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for every open ball @xmath and functions @xmath such that @xmath on
@xmath .

Connection with the theory of minimal surfaces. The Allen-Cahn equation
has its origin in the theory of phase transitions and it is used as a
model for some nonlinear reaction-diffusion processes. To better
understand this, let @xmath be a bounded domain, and consider the
Allen-Cahn equation with parameter @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

with associated energy functional given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

Assume now that there are two populations (or chemical states) A and B
and that @xmath is a density measuring the percentage of the two
populations at every point: if @xmath (respectively, @xmath ) at a point
@xmath , we have only population A at @xmath (respectively, population
B); @xmath means that at @xmath we have @xmath of population A and
@xmath of population @xmath .

By ( 2.41 ), it is clear that in order to minimize @xmath as @xmath
tends to @xmath , @xmath must be very small. From Figure 2.9 we see that
this happens when @xmath is close to @xmath . These heuristics are
indeed formally confirmed by a celebrated theorem of Modica and Mortola.
It states that, if @xmath is a family of minimizers of @xmath , then, up
to a subsequence, @xmath converges in @xmath , as @xmath tends to @xmath
, to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for some disjoint sets @xmath having as common boundary a surface @xmath
. In addition, @xmath is a minimizing minimal surface. Therefore, the
result of Modica-Mortola establishes that the two populations tend to
their total separation, and in such a (clever) way that the interface
surface @xmath of separation has least possible area.

Finally, notice that the @xmath -d solution of ( 2.40 ),

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

makes a very fast transition from @xmath to @xmath in a scale of order
@xmath . Accordingly, in Figure 2.10 , @xmath will make this type of
fast transition across the limiting minimizing minimal surface @xmath .
The interested reader can see [ 1 ] for more details.

##### 2.2.1 Minimality of monotone solutions with limits @xmath

The following fundamental result shows that monotone solutions with
limits @xmath are minimizers (as in Definition 2.25 ).

###### Theorem 2.26 (Alberti-Ambrosio-Cabré [1]).

Suppose that @xmath is a solution of ( 2.37 ) satisfying the
monotonicity hypothesis ( 2.38 ) and the condition ( 2.39 ) on limits.
Then, @xmath is a minimizer of ( 2.37 ) in @xmath .

See [ 1 ] for the original proof of the Theorem 2.26 . It uses a
calibration built from a foliation and avoids the use of the strong
maximum principle, but it is slightly involved. Instead, the simple
proof that we give here was suggested to the first author (after one of
his lectures on [ 1 ] ) by L. Caffarelli. It uses a simple foliation
argument together with the strong maximum principle, as in the
alternative proof of Theorem 2.7 given in Subsection 2.1.1 .

###### Proof of Theorem 2.26.

Denoting @xmath , let us consider the functions

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By the monotonicity assumption ( 2.38 ) we have that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus, by ( 2.39 ) we have that the graphs of @xmath , @xmath , form a
foliation filling all of @xmath . Moreover, we have that for every
@xmath , @xmath are solutions of @xmath in @xmath .

By simple arguments of the Calculus of Variations, given a ball @xmath
it can be proved that there exists a minimizer @xmath of @xmath such
that @xmath on @xmath . In particular, @xmath satisfies

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

By ( 2.39 ), we have that the graph of @xmath in the compact set @xmath
is above the graph of @xmath for @xmath large enough, and it is below
the graph of @xmath for @xmath negative enough (see Figure 2.11 ). If
@xmath , assume that @xmath at some point in @xmath (the situation
@xmath somewhere in @xmath is done similarly). It follows that, starting
from @xmath , there will exist a first @xmath such that @xmath touches
@xmath at a point @xmath . This means that @xmath in @xmath and @xmath .

By ( 2.42 ), @xmath , and the fact that @xmath on @xmath , the point
@xmath cannot belong to @xmath . Thus, @xmath will be an interior point
of @xmath .

But then we have that @xmath and @xmath are two solutions of the same
semilinear equation (the Allen-Cahn equation), the graph of @xmath stays
below that of @xmath , and they touch each other at the interior point
@xmath . This is a contradiction with the strong maximum principle.

Here we leave as an exercise (stated next) to verify that the difference
of two solutions of @xmath satisfies a linear elliptic equation to which
we can apply the strong maximum principle. This leads to @xmath , which
contradicts @xmath on @xmath . ∎

###### Exercise 2.7.

Prove that the difference @xmath of two solutions of a semilinear
equation @xmath , where @xmath is a Lipschitz function, satisfies a
linear equation of the form @xmath , for some function @xmath . Verify
that, as a consequence, this leads to @xmath in the previous proof.

By recalling Remark 2.24 , we immediately get the following corollary.

###### Corollary 2.27.

The 1-d solution @xmath is a minimizer of ( 2.37 ) in @xmath , for every
unit vector @xmath .

As a corollary of Theorem 2.26 , we easily deduce the following
important energy estimates.

###### Corollary 2.28 (Energy upper bounds; Ambrosio-Cabré [2]).

Let @xmath be a solution of ( 2.37 ) satisfying ( 2.38 ) and ( 2.39 )
(or more generally, let @xmath be a minimizer in @xmath ).

Then, for all @xmath we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

for some constant @xmath independent of @xmath . In particular, since
@xmath , we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for all @xmath .

###### Remark 2.29.

The proof of Corollary 2.28 is trivial for @xmath -d solutions. Indeed,
it is easy to check that @xmath and, as a consequence, by applying
Fubini’s theorem on a cube larger than @xmath , that ( 2.43 ) holds.
This argument also shows that the exponent @xmath in ( 2.43 ) is optimal
(since it cannot be improved for @xmath -d solutions).

The estimates in Corollary 2.28 are fundamental in the proofs of a
conjecture of De Giorgi that we treat in the next subsection.

The estimate ( 2.43 ) was first proved by Ambrosio and the first author
in [ 2 ] . Later on, in [ 1 ] Alberti, Ambrosio, and the first author
discovered that monotone solutions with limits are minimizers (Theorem
2.26 above). This allowed to simplify the original proof of the energy
estimates found in [ 2 ] , as follows.

###### Proof of Corollary 2.28.

Since @xmath is a minimizer by Theorem 2.26 (or by hypothesis), we can
perform a simple energy comparison argument. Indeed, let @xmath satisfy
@xmath in @xmath , @xmath in @xmath , @xmath in @xmath , and @xmath .
Consider

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since @xmath on @xmath , we can compare the energy of @xmath in @xmath
with that of @xmath . We obtain

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for every @xmath , with @xmath independent of @xmath . In the second
inequality of the chain above we used that @xmath in @xmath for some
constant @xmath independent of @xmath . This is a consequence of the
following exercise. ∎

###### Exercise 2.8.

Prove that if @xmath is a solution of a semilinear equation @xmath in
@xmath and @xmath in @xmath , where @xmath is a continuous nonlinearity,
then @xmath in @xmath for some constant @xmath depending only on @xmath
and @xmath . See [ 2 ] , if necessary, for a proof.

##### 2.2.2 A conjecture of De Giorgi

In 1978, E. De Giorgi [ 20 ] stated the following conjecture:

Conjecture (DG). Let @xmath be a solution of the Allen-Cahn equation (
2.37 ) satisfying the monotonicity condition ( 2.38 ). Then, @xmath is a
@xmath -d solution (or equivalently, all level sets @xmath of @xmath are
hyperplanes), at least if @xmath .

This conjecture was proved in 1997 for @xmath by Ghoussoub and Gui [ 26
] , and in 2000 for @xmath by Ambrosio and Cabré [ 2 ] . Next we state a
deep result of Savin [ 33 ] under the only assumption of minimality.
This is the semilinear analogue of Simons Theorem 2.12 and Remark 2.13
on minimal surfaces. As we will see, Savin’s result leads to a proof of
Conjecture (DG) for @xmath if the additional condition ( 2.39 ) on
limits is assumed.

###### Theorem 2.30 (Savin [33]).

Assume that @xmath and that @xmath is a minimizer of ( 2.37 ) in @xmath
. Then, @xmath is a @xmath -d solution.

The hypothesis @xmath on its statement is sharp. Indeed, in 2017 Liu,
Wang, and Wei [ 31 ] have shown the existence of a minimizer in @xmath
whose level sets are not hyperplanes. Its zero level set is asymptotic
at infinity to the Simons cone. However, a canonical solution described
in Subsection 2.2.3 (and whose zero level set is exactly the Simons
cone) is still not known to be a minimizer in @xmath .

Note that Theorem 2.30 makes no assumptions on the monotonicity or the
limits at infinity of the solution. To prove Conjecture (DG) using
Savin’s result (Theorem 2.30 ), one needs to make the further assumption
( 2.39 ) on the limits only to guarantee, by Theorem 2.26 , that the
solution is actually a minimizer. Then, Theorem 2.30 (and the gain of
one more dimension, @xmath , thanks to the monotonicity of the solution)
leads to the proof of Conjecture (DG) for monotone solutions with limits
@xmath .

However, for @xmath the conjecture in its original statement (i.e.,
without the limits @xmath as hypothesis) is still open. To our knowledge
no clear evidence is known about its validity or not.

The proof of Theorem 2.30 uses an improvement of flatness result for the
Allen-Cahn equation developed by Savin, as well as Theorem 2.12 on the
non-existence of stable minimal cones in dimension @xmath .

Instead, the proofs of Conjecture (DG) in dimensions @xmath and @xmath
are much simpler. They use the energy estimates of Corollary 2.28 and a
Liouville-type theorem developed in [ 2 ] (see also [ 1 ] ). As
explained next, the idea of the proof originates in the paper [ 3 ] by
Berestycki, Caffarelli, and Nirenberg.

Motivation for the proof of Conjecture (DG) for @xmath . In [ 3 ] the
authors made the following heuristic observation. From the equation
@xmath and the monotonicity assumption ( 2.38 ), by differentiating we
find that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

If we were in a bounded domain @xmath instead of @xmath (and we forgot
about boundary conditions), from ( 2.44 ), we would deduce that @xmath
is the first eigenfunction of @xmath and that its first eigenvalue is
@xmath . As a consequence, such eigenvalue is simple. But then, since we
also have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

the simplicity of the eigenvalue would lead to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are constants. Now, we would conclude that @xmath is a 1-d
solution, by the following exercise.

###### Exercise 2.9.

Check that ( 2.45 ), with @xmath being constants, is equivalent to the
fact that @xmath is a 1-d solution.

To make this argument work in the whole @xmath , one needs a
Liouville-type theorem. For @xmath it was proved in [ 3 ] and [ 26 ] .
Later, [ 2 ] used it to prove Conjecture (DG) in @xmath after proving
the crucial energy estimate ( 2.43 ). The Liouville theorem requires the
right hand side of ( 2.43 ) to be bounded by @xmath .

In 2011, del Pino, Kowalczyk, and Wei [ 21 ] established that
Conjecture (DG) does not hold for @xmath – as suggested in De Giorgi’s
original statement.

###### Theorem 2.31 (del Pino-Kowalczyk-Wei [21]).

If @xmath , there exists a solution of ( 2.37 ), satisfying ( 2.38 ) and
( 2.39 ), and which is not a @xmath -d solution.

The proof in [ 21 ] uses crucially the minimal graph in @xmath built by
Bombieri, De Giorgi, and Giusti in [ 5 ] . This is a minimal surface in
@xmath given by the graph of a function @xmath which is antisymmetric
with respect to the Simons cone. The solution of Theorem 2.31 is built
in such a way that its zero level set stays at finite distance from the
Bombieri-De Giorgi-Giusti graph.

We consider next a similar object to the previous minimal graph, but in
the context of the Allen-Cahn equation: a solution @xmath which is
antisymmetric with respect to the Simons cone.

##### 2.2.3 The saddle-shaped solution vanishing on the Simons cone

As in Section 2.1 , let @xmath and denote by @xmath the Simons cone (
2.5 ). For @xmath , @xmath and @xmath denote the two radial variables

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Simons cone is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

###### Definition 2.32 (Saddle-shaped solution).

We say that @xmath is a saddle-shaped solution (or simply a saddle
solution) of the Allen-Cahn equation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

whenever @xmath is a solution of ( 2.47 ) and, with @xmath and @xmath
defined by ( 2.46 ),

1.  @xmath depends only on the variables @xmath and @xmath . We write
    @xmath ;

2.  @xmath in @xmath ;

3.  @xmath in @xmath .

###### Remark 2.33.

Notice that if @xmath is a saddle-shaped solution, then we have @xmath
on @xmath (see Figure 2.12 ).

While the existence of a saddle-shaped solution is easily established,
its uniqueness is more delicate. This was accomplished in 2012 by the
first author in [ 9 ] .

###### Theorem 2.34 (Cabré [9]).

For every even dimension @xmath , there exists a unique saddle-shaped
solution @xmath of ( 2.47 ).

Due to the minimality of the Simons cone when @xmath (and also because
of the minimizer from [ 31 ] referred to after Theorem 2.30 ), the
saddle-shaped solution is expected to be a minimizer when @xmath :

###### Open problem 2.35.

Is the saddle-shaped solution a minimizer of ( 2.47 ) in @xmath , or at
least in higher even dimensions?

Nothing is known on this open problem except for the following result.
It establishes stability (a weaker property than minimality) for @xmath
. Below, we sketch its proof.

###### Theorem 2.36 (Cabré [9]).

If @xmath , the saddle-shaped solution @xmath of ( 2.47 ) is stable in
@xmath , in the sense of the following definition.

###### Definition 2.37 (Stability).

We say that a solution @xmath of @xmath in @xmath is stable if the
second variation of the energy with respect to compactly supported
perturbations @xmath is nonnegative. That is, if

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In the rest of this section, we will take @xmath and @xmath to be the
Allen-Cahn nonlinearity, i.e., @xmath

###### Outline of the proof (of Theorem 2.36).

Notice that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

for @xmath and @xmath , is equation ( 2.47 ) expressed in the @xmath
variables. Let us introduce the function

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

Differentiating ( 2.48 ) with respect to @xmath (and to @xmath ), one
finds equations satisfied by @xmath (and by @xmath ) – and which involve
a zero order term with coefficient @xmath . These equations, together
with some more delicate monotonicity properties of the saddle-shaped
solution established in [ 9 ] , can be used to prove the following fact.

For @xmath , one can choose @xmath in ( 2.49 ) (see [ 9 ] for more
details) such that @xmath is a positive supersolution of the linearized
problem, i.e.:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

Next, using ( 2.50 ) and ( 2.51 ), we can verify the stability condition
of @xmath for any @xmath test function @xmath with compact support in
@xmath . Indeed, multiply ( 2.51 ) by @xmath and integrate by parts to
get

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Now, using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we are led to

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Finally, by a cut-off argument we can prove that this same inequality
holds also for every function @xmath . ∎

###### Remark 2.38.

Alternatively to the variational proof seen above, another way to
establish stability from the existence of a positive supersolution to
the linearized problem is by using the maximum principle (see [ 4 ] for
more details).

#### 2.3 Blow-up problems

In this final section, we consider positive solutions of the semilinear
problem

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a smooth bounded domain, @xmath , and @xmath is @xmath .

The associated energy functional is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is such that @xmath .

##### 2.3.1 Stable and extremal solutions. A singular stable solution
for @xmath

We define next the class of stable solutions to ( 2.52 ). It includes
any local minimizer, i.e., any minimizer of ( 2.53 ) under small
perturbations vanishing on @xmath .

###### Definition 2.39 (Stability).

A solution @xmath of ( 2.52 ) is said to be stable if the second
variation of the energy with respect to @xmath perturbations @xmath
vanishing on @xmath is nonnegative. That is, if

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

There are many nonlinearities for which ( 2.52 ) admits a (positive)
stable solution. Indeed, replace @xmath by @xmath in ( 2.52 ), with
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

Assume that @xmath is positive, nondecreasing, and superlinear at @xmath
, that is,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that also in this case we look for positive solutions (when @xmath
), since @xmath . We point out that, for @xmath , @xmath is not a
solution.

###### Proposition 2.40.

Assuming ( 2.56 ), there exists an extremal parameter @xmath such that
if @xmath then ( 2.55 ) admits a minimal stable classical solution
@xmath . Here “minimal” means the smallest among all the solutions,
while “classical” means of class @xmath . Being classical is a
consequence of @xmath if @xmath .

On the other hand, if @xmath then ( 2.55 ) has no classical solution.

The family of classical solutions @xmath is increasing in @xmath , and
its limit as @xmath is a weak solution @xmath of ( 2.55 ) for @xmath .

###### Definition 2.41 (Extremal solution).

The function @xmath given by Proposition 2.40 is called the extremal
solution of ( 2.55 ).

For a proof of Proposition 2.40 see the book [ 25 ] by L. Dupaigne. The
definition of weak solution (the sense in which @xmath is a solution)
requires @xmath , @xmath , and the equation to be satisfied in the
distributional sense after multiplying it by test functions vanishing on
@xmath and integrating by parts twice (see [ 25 ] ). Other useful
references regarding extremal and stable solutions are [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] ,
and [ 11 ] .

Since 1996, Brezis has raised several questions regarding stable and
extremal solutions; see for instance [ 6 ] . They have led to
interesting works, some of them described next. One of his questions is
the following.

Question (Brezis). Depending on the dimension @xmath or on the domain
@xmath , is the extremal solution @xmath of ( 2.55 ) bounded (and
therefore classical) or is it unbounded? More generally, one may ask the
same question for the larger class of stable solutions to ( 2.52 ).

The following is an explicit example of stable unbounded (or singular)
solution.

It is easy to check that, for @xmath , the function @xmath is a solution
of ( 2.52 ) in @xmath , the unit ball, for @xmath . Let us now consider
the linearized operator at @xmath , which is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

If @xmath , then its first Dirichlet eigenvalue in @xmath is
nonnegative. This is a consequence of Hardy’s inequality ( 2.25 ):

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the fact that @xmath if @xmath . Thus we proved the following
result.

###### Proposition 2.42.

For @xmath , @xmath is an @xmath stable weak solution of @xmath in
@xmath , @xmath in @xmath , @xmath on @xmath .

Thus, in dimensions @xmath there exist unbounded @xmath stable weak
solutions of ( 2.52 ), even in the unit ball and for the exponential
nonlinearity. It is believed that @xmath could be the optimal dimension
for this fact, as we describe next.

##### 2.3.2 Regularity of stable solutions. The Allard and Michael-Simon
Sobolev inequality

The following results give @xmath bounds for stable solutions. To avoid
technicalities we state the bounds for the extremal solution but, more
generally, they also apply to every stable weak solution of ( 2.52 )
which is the pointwise limit of a sequence of bounded stable solutions
to similar equations (see [ 25 ] ).

###### Theorem 2.43 (Crandall-Rabinowitz [18]).

Let @xmath be the extremal solution of ( 2.55 ) with @xmath or @xmath ,
@xmath . If @xmath , then @xmath .

###### Outline of the proof (in the case @xmath).

Use the equation in ( 2.55 ) for the classical solutions @xmath ( @xmath
), together with the stability condition ( 2.54 ) for the test function
@xmath (for a positive exponent @xmath to be chosen later). More
precisely, start from ( 2.54 ) – with @xmath replaced by @xmath – and to
proceed with @xmath , write @xmath , and integrate by parts to use (
2.55 ). For every @xmath , verify that this leads, after letting @xmath
, to @xmath . As a consequence, by Calderón-Zygmund theory and Sobolev
embeddings, @xmath if @xmath . This requires that @xmath . ∎

Notice that the nonlinearities @xmath or @xmath with @xmath satisfy (
2.56 ).

In the radial case @xmath we have the following result.

###### Theorem 2.44 (Cabré-Capella [12]).

Let @xmath be the extremal solution of ( 2.55 ). Assume that @xmath
satisfies ( 2.56 ) and that @xmath . If @xmath , then @xmath .

As mentioned before, this theorem also holds for every @xmath stable
weak solution of ( 2.52 ), for any @xmath . Thus, in view of Proposition
2.42 , the dimension @xmath is optimal in this result.

We turn now to the nonradial case and we present the currently known
results. First, in 2000 Nedev solved the case @xmath .

###### Theorem 2.45 (Nedev [32]).

Let @xmath be convex and satisfy ( 2.56 ), and @xmath be a smooth
bounded domain. If @xmath , then @xmath .

In 2010, Nedev’s result was improved to dimension four:

###### Theorem 2.46 (Cabré [8]; Villegas [37]).

Let @xmath satisfy ( 2.56 ), @xmath be a smooth bounded domain, and
@xmath . If @xmath assume either that @xmath is a convex nonlinearity or
that @xmath is a convex domain. Then, @xmath .

For @xmath , [ 8 ] requires @xmath to be convex, while @xmath needs not
be convex. Some years later, S. Villegas [ 37 ] succeeded to use both [
8 ] and [ 32 ] when @xmath to remove the requirement that @xmath is
convex by further assuming that @xmath is convex.

###### Open problem 2.47.

For every @xmath and for every @xmath satisfying ( 2.56 ), is the
extremal solution @xmath – or, in general, @xmath stable weak solutions
of ( 2.52 ) – always bounded in dimensions @xmath ?

We recall that the answer to this question is affirmative when @xmath ,
by Theorem 2.44 . We next sketch the proof of this radial result, as
well as the regularity theorem in the nonradial case up to @xmath . In
the case @xmath , we will need the following remarkable result.

###### Theorem 2.48 (Allard; Michael and Simon).

Let @xmath be an immersed smooth @xmath -dimensional compact
hypersurface without boundary.

Then, for every @xmath , there exists a constant @xmath depending only
on the dimension @xmath and the exponent @xmath such that, for every
@xmath function @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the mean curvature of @xmath and @xmath .

This theorem dates from 1972 and has its origin in an important result
of Miranda from 1967. It stated that ( 2.57 ) holds with @xmath if
@xmath is a minimal surface in @xmath . See the book [ 25 ] for a proof
of Theorem 2.48 .

###### Remark 2.49.

Note that this Sobolev inequality contains a term involving the mean
curvature of @xmath on its right-hand side. This fact makes, in a
remarkable way, that the constant @xmath in the inequality does not
depend on the geometry of the manifold @xmath .

###### Outline of the proof (of Theorems 2.44, 2.45, and 2.46).

For Theorem 2.45 the test function to be used is @xmath , for some
@xmath depending on @xmath (as in the proof of Theorem 2.43 ).

Instead, for Theorems 2.44 and 2.46 , the proofs start by writing the
stability condition ( 2.54 ) for the test function @xmath , where @xmath
. This was motivated by the analogous computation that we have presented
for minimal surfaces right after Remark 2.14 . Integrating by parts, one
easily deduces that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

Next, a key point is to choose a function @xmath satisfying an
appropriate equation for the linearized operator @xmath . In the radial
case (Theorem 2.44 ) the choice of @xmath and the final choice of @xmath
are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath is later truncated near the origin to
make it Lipschitz. The proof in the radial case is quite simple after
computing the equation satisfied by @xmath .

For the estimate up to dimension 4 in the nonradial case (Theorem 2.46
), [ 8 ] takes

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

where, in dimension @xmath , @xmath is chosen depending on the solution
@xmath itself.

We make the choice ( 2.59 ) and, in particular, we take @xmath in ( 2.58
). It is easy to check that, in the set @xmath , we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

Taking an orthonormal basis in which the last vector is the normal
@xmath to the level set of @xmath (through a given point @xmath ), and
the other vectors are the principal directions of the level set at
@xmath , one easily sees that ( 2.60 ) can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the squared norm of the second fundamental form of the
level set of @xmath passing through a given point @xmath , i.e., the sum
of the squares of the principal curvatures of the level set. In the
notation of the first section on minimal surfaces, @xmath . On the other
hand, as in that section @xmath denotes the tangential gradient to the
level set. Thus, ( 2.61 ) involves geometric information of the level
sets of @xmath .

Therefore, using the stability condition ( 2.58 ), we conclude that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

Let us define

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for @xmath .

We now use ( 2.62 ) with @xmath , where @xmath is a Lipschitz function
in @xmath with @xmath . The right hand side of ( 2.62 ) becomes

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

by the coarea formula . Thus, ( 2.62 ) can be written as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

We conclude that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

for all Lipschitz functions @xmath with @xmath , where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for every regular value @xmath of @xmath . We recall that, by Sard’s
theorem, almost every @xmath is a regular value of @xmath .

Inequality ( 2.63 ), with @xmath and @xmath as defined above, leads to a
bound for @xmath (that is, to an @xmath estimate and hence to Theorem
2.46 ) after choosing an appropriate test function @xmath in ( 2.63 ).
In dimensions 2 and 3 we can choose a simple function @xmath in ( 2.63 )
and use well known geometric inequalities about the curvature of
manifolds (note that @xmath involves the curvature of the level sets of
@xmath ). Instead, in dimension 4 we need to use the geometric Sobolev
inequality of Theorem 2.48 on each level set of @xmath . Note that
@xmath . This gives the following lower bound for @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Comparing this with @xmath , which appears in the right hand side of (
2.63 ), we only know how to derive an @xmath -estimate for @xmath (i.e.,
a bound on @xmath ) when the exponent @xmath in the above inequality is
larger than or equal to the exponent @xmath in @xmath . This requires
@xmath . See [ 8 ] for details on how the proof is finished. ∎

#### 2.4 Appendix: a calibration giving the optimal isoperimetric
inequality

Our first proof of Theorem 2.7 used a calibration. To understand better
the concept and use of “calibrations”, we present here another one. It
leads to a proof of the isoperimetric problem.

The isoperimetric problems asks which sets in @xmath minimize perimeter
for a given volume. Making the first variation of perimeter (as in
Section 2.1 ), but now with a volume constraint, one discovers that a
minimizer @xmath should satisfy @xmath (with @xmath a constant), at
least in a weak sense, where @xmath is the mean curvature of @xmath .
Obviously, balls satisfy this equation – they have constant mean
curvature. The isoperimetric inequality states that the unique
minimizers are, indeed, balls. In other words, we have:

###### Theorem 2.50 (The isoperimetric inequality).

We have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

for every bounded smooth domain @xmath . In addition, if equality holds
in ( 2.64 ), then @xmath must be a ball.

In 1996 the first author found the following proof of the isoperimetric
problem. It uses a calibration (for more details see [ 10 ] ).

###### Outline of the proof (of the isoperimetric inequality).

The initial idea was to characterize the perimeter @xmath as in ( 2.9
)-( 2.10 ), that is, as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Taking @xmath to be a gradient, we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for every function @xmath such that @xmath on @xmath . Let us take
@xmath to be the solution of

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a constant that, by the divergence theorem, is given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

It is known that there exists a unique solution @xmath to ( 2.65 ) (up
to an additive constant).

Now let us see that @xmath (where @xmath was the notation that we used
in the proof of Theorem 2.7 ) can play the role of a calibration. In
fact, in analogy with Definition 2.8 we have:

1.  (i-bis) @xmath ;

2.  (ii-bis) @xmath ;

3.  (iii-bis) @xmath , where

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    is the lower contact set of @xmath , that is, the set of the points
    of @xmath at which the tangent plane to @xmath stays below @xmath in
    @xmath .

The relations (i-bis) and (ii-bis) follow immediately from ( 2.65 ). In
the following exercise, we ask to establish (iii-bis) and finish the
proof of ( 2.64 ).

We point out that this proof also gives that @xmath must be a ball if
equality holds in ( 2.64 ). ∎

###### Exercise 2.10.

Establish (iii-bis) above. For this, use a foliation-contact argument
(as in the alternative proof of Theorem 2.7 and in the proof of Theorem
2.26 ), foliating now @xmath by parallel hyperplanes.

Next, finish the proof of ( 2.64 ). For this, consider the measures of
the two sets in (iii-bis), compute @xmath using the area formula , and
control @xmath using the geometric-arithmetic means inequality.

  Abstract. In Real Analysis, Littlewood’s three principles are known as
  heuristics that help teach the essentials of measure theory and reveal
  the analogies between the concepts of topological space and continuous
  function on one side and those of measurable space and measurable
  function on the other one. They are based on important and rigorous
  statements, such as Lusin’s and Egoroff-Severini’s theorems, and have
  ingenious and elegant proofs. We shall comment on those theorems and
  show how their proofs can possibly be made simpler by introducing a
  fourth principle . These alternative proofs make even more manifest
  those analogies and show that Egoroff-Severini’s theorem can be
  considered as the natural generalization of the classical Dini’s
  monotone convergence theorem.

#### 3.1 Introduction.

John Edenson Littlewood (9 June 1885 - 6 September 1977) was a British
mathematician. In 1944, he wrote an influential textbook, Lectures on
the Theory of Functions ( [ 7 ] ), in which he proposed three principles
as guides for working in real analysis; these are heuristics to help
teach the essentials of measure theory, as Littlewood himself wrote in [
7 ] :

  The extent of knowledge [of real analysis] required is nothing like so
  great as is sometimes supposed. There are three principles, roughly
  expressible in the following terms: every (measurable) set is nearly a
  finite sum of intervals; every function (of class @xmath ) is nearly
  continuous; every convergent sequence is nearly uniformly convergent.
  Most of the results of the present section are fairly intuitive
  applications of these ideas, and the student armed with them should be
  equal to most occasions when real variable theory is called for. If
  one of the principles would be the obvious means to settle a problem
  if it were “quite” true, it is natural to ask if the “nearly” is near
  enough, and for a problem that is actually soluble it generally is.

To benefit our further discussion, we shall express Littlewood’s
principles and their rigorous statements in forms that are slightly
different from those originally stated.

The first principle descends directly from the very definition of
Lebesgue measurability of a set.

###### First Principle.

Every measurable set is nearly closed.

The second principle relates the measurability of a function to the more
familiar property of continuity.

###### Second Principle.

Every measurable function is nearly continuous.

The third principle connects the pointwise convergence of a sequence of
functions to the standard concept of uniform convergence.

###### Third Principle.

Every sequence of measurable functions that converges pointwise almost
everywhere is nearly uniformly convergent.

These principles are based on important theorems that give a rigorous
meaning to the term “nearly”. We shall recall these in the next section
along with their ingenious proofs that give a taste of the standard
arguments used in Real Analysis.

In Section 3, we will discuss a fourth principle that associates the
concept of finiteness of a function to that of its boundedness.

###### Fourth Principle.

Every measurable function that is finite almost everywhere is nearly
bounded.

In the mathematical literature (see [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 11
] , [ 12 ] , [ 14 ] ), the proof of the second principle is based on the
third; it can be easily seen that the fourth principle can be derived
from the second.

However, we shall see that the fourth principle can also be proved
independently; this fact makes possible a proof of the second principle
without appealing for the third, that itself can be derived from the
second, by a totally new proof based on Dini’s monotone convergence
theorem .

As in [ 7 ] , to make our discussion as simple as possible, we shall
consider the Lebesgue measure @xmath for the real line @xmath .

#### 3.2 The three principles

We recall the definitions of inner and outer measure of a set @xmath :
they are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the number @xmath is the infimum of the total lengths of all the
finite unions of open intervals that contain @xmath ; accordingly,
@xmath is the supremum of the total lengths of all the finite unions of
closed intervals contained in @xmath . It always holds that @xmath . The
set @xmath is (Lebesgue) measurable if and only if @xmath ; when this is
the case, the measure of @xmath is @xmath ; thus @xmath and it can be
proved that @xmath is a measure on the @xmath -algebra of Lebesgue
measurable subsets of @xmath .

By the properties of the supremum, it is easily seen that, for any pair
of subsets @xmath and @xmath of @xmath , @xmath and @xmath if @xmath .
The first principle is a condition for the measurability of subsets of
@xmath .

###### Theorem 3.1 (First Principle).

Let @xmath be a set of finite outer measure.

Then, @xmath is measurable if and only if for every @xmath there exist
two sets @xmath and @xmath , with @xmath closed (compact), @xmath and
@xmath .

This is what is meant by nearly closed .

###### Proof.

If @xmath is measurable, for any @xmath we can find a compact set @xmath
and an open set @xmath such that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The set @xmath is open and contains @xmath . Thus, by setting @xmath ,
we have @xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Viceversa, for every @xmath we have:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since @xmath is arbitrary, then @xmath . ∎

The second and third principles concern measurable functions from
(measurable) subsets of @xmath to the extended real line @xmath , that
is functions are allowed to have values @xmath and @xmath .

Let @xmath be a function defined on a measurable subset @xmath of @xmath
. We say that @xmath is measurable if the level sets defined by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

are measurable subsets of @xmath for every @xmath . It is easy to verify
that if we replace @xmath with @xmath we have an equivalent definition.

Since the countable union and intersection of measurable sets are
measurable, it is not hard to show that the pointwise infimum and
supremum of a sequence of measurable functions @xmath are measurable
functions as well as the function defined for any @xmath by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since the countable union of sets of measure zero has measure zero and
the difference between @xmath and any set of measure zero is measurable,
the same definitions and conclusions hold even if the functions @xmath
and @xmath are defined almost everywhere (denoted for short by a.e.),
that is if the subsets of @xmath in which they are not defined have
measure zero. In the same spirit, we say that a function or a sequence
of functions satisfies a given property a.e. in @xmath , if that
property holds with the exception of a subset of measure zero.

As already mentioned, the third principle is needed to prove the second
and is known as Egoroff’s theorem or Egoroff-Severini’s theorem . ³ ³ 3
Dmitri Egoroff, a Russian physicist and geometer and Carlo Severini, an
Italian mathematician, published independent proofs of this theorem in
1910 and 1911 (see [ 5 ] and [ 13 ] ); Severini’s assumptions are more
restrictive. Severini’s result is not very well-known, since it is
hidden in a paper on orthogonal polynomials, published in Italian.

###### Theorem 3.2 (Third Principle; Egoroff-Severini).

Let @xmath be a measurable set with finite measure and let @xmath be
measurable and finite a.e. in @xmath .

The sequence of measurable functions @xmath converges a.e. to @xmath in
@xmath for @xmath if and only if, for every @xmath , there exists a
closed set @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath converges uniformly to
@xmath on @xmath .

This is what we mean by nearly uniformly convergent .

###### Proof.

If @xmath a.e. in @xmath as @xmath , the subset of @xmath in which
@xmath pointwise has the same measure as @xmath ; hence, without loss of
generality, we can assume that @xmath converges to @xmath for every
@xmath .

Consider the functions defined by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the sets

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Observe that, if @xmath , then @xmath as @xmath and hence for any @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

As @xmath is increasing with @xmath , the monotone convergence theorem
implies that @xmath converges to @xmath for @xmath and for any @xmath .
Thus, for every @xmath and @xmath , there exists an index @xmath such
that @xmath

The measure of the set @xmath is arbitrary small, in fact

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Also, since @xmath is measurable, by Thorem 3.1 there exists a compact
set @xmath such that @xmath , and hence

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since @xmath we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

by the definitions of @xmath and @xmath ; this means that @xmath
converges uniformly to @xmath on @xmath as @xmath . Viceversa, if for
every @xmath there is a closed set @xmath with @xmath and @xmath
uniformly on @xmath , then by choosing @xmath we can say that there is a
closed set @xmath such that @xmath uniformly on @xmath and @xmath .

Therefore, @xmath for any @xmath in the set @xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which implies that @xmath . Thus, @xmath a.e. in @xmath as @xmath .

∎

The second principle corresponds to Lusin’s theorem (see [ 8 ] ), ⁴ ⁴ 4
N. N. Lusin or Luzin was a student of Egoroff. For biographical notes on
Egoroff and Lusin see [ 6 ] . that we state here in a form similar to
Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 .

###### Theorem 3.3 (Second Principle; Lusin).

Let @xmath be a measurable set with finite measure and let @xmath be
finite a.e. in @xmath .

Then, @xmath is measurable in @xmath if and only if, for every @xmath ,
there exists a closed set @xmath such that @xmath and the restriction of
@xmath to @xmath is continuous.

This is what we mean by nearly continuos . The proof of Lusin’s theorem
is done by approximation by simple functions. A simple function is a
measurable function that has a finite number of real values. If @xmath
are the distinct values of a simple function @xmath , then @xmath can be
conveniently represented as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath is the characteristic function of the set @xmath . Notice
that the @xmath ’s form a covering of @xmath of pairwise disjoint
measurable sets.

Simple functions play a crucial role in Real Analysis; this is mainly
due to the following result of which we shall omit the proof.

###### Theorem 3.4 (Approximation by Simple Functions, [11], [12]).

Let @xmath be a measurable set and let @xmath be a measurable function.

Then, there exists an increasing sequence of non-negative simple
functions @xmath that converges pointwise to @xmath in @xmath for @xmath
.

Moreover, if @xmath is bounded, then @xmath converges to @xmath
uniformly in @xmath .

We can now give the proof of Lusin’s theorem.

###### Proof.

Any measurable function @xmath can be decomposed as @xmath , where
@xmath and @xmath are measurable and non-negative functions. Thus, we
can always suppose that @xmath is non-negative and hence, by Theorem 3.4
, it can be approximated pointwise by a sequence of simple functions.

We first prove that a simple function @xmath is nearly continuos. Since
the sets @xmath defining @xmath are measurable, if we fix @xmath we can
find closed subsets @xmath of @xmath such that @xmath for @xmath . The
union @xmath of the sets @xmath is also a closed set and, since the
@xmath ’s cover @xmath , we have that @xmath . Since the closed sets
@xmath are pairwise disjoint (as the @xmath ’s are pairwise disjoint)
and @xmath is constant on @xmath for all @xmath , we conclude that
@xmath is continuous in @xmath .

Now, if @xmath is measurable and non-negative, let @xmath be a sequence
of simple functions that converges pointwise to @xmath and fix an @xmath
.

As the @xmath ’s are nearly continuous, for any natural number @xmath ,
there exists a closed set @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath is
continuous in @xmath . By Theorem 3.2 , there exists a closed set @xmath
such that @xmath and @xmath converges uniformly to @xmath in @xmath as
@xmath . Thus, in the set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

the functions @xmath are all continuous and converge uniformly to @xmath
. Therefore @xmath is continuous in @xmath and

  -- -- --
        
  -- -- --

Viceversa, if @xmath is nearly continuous, fix an @xmath and let @xmath
be a closed subset of @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath is continuous
in @xmath . For any @xmath , we have:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The former set in this decomposition is closed, as the restriction of
@xmath to @xmath is continuous, while the latter is clearly a subset of
@xmath and hence its outer measure must be less than @xmath . By Theorem
3.1 , @xmath is measurable (for any @xmath ), which means that @xmath is
measurable. ∎

#### 3.3 The fourth principle

We shall now present alternative proofs of Theorems 3.2 and 3.3 . They
are based on a fourth principle, that corresponds to the following
theorem.

###### Theorem 3.5 (Fourth Principle).

Let @xmath be a measurable set with finite measure and let @xmath be a
measurable function.

Then, @xmath is finite a.e. in @xmath if and only if, for every @xmath ,
there exists a closed set @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath is bounded
on @xmath .

This is what we mean by nearly bounded .

###### Proof.

If @xmath is finite a.e., we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

As @xmath is measurable, @xmath is also measurable and so are the sets

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Observe that the sequence of sets @xmath is decreasing and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

As @xmath , we can apply the (downward) monotone convergence theorem and
infer that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus, if we fix @xmath , there is an @xmath such that @xmath . Also, we
can find a closed subset @xmath of the measurable set @xmath such that
@xmath . Finally, since @xmath , @xmath is obviously bounded by @xmath
on @xmath and

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Viceversa, if @xmath is nearly bounded, then for any @xmath there exists
a closed set @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath is bounded (and hence
finite) in @xmath . Thus, @xmath for any @xmath , and hence

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

that is @xmath is finite a.e.. ∎

###### Remark 3.6.

Notice that this theorem can also be derived from Theorem 3.3 . In fact,
without loss of generality, the closed set @xmath provided by Theorem
3.3 can be taken to be compact and hence, @xmath is surely bounded on
@xmath , being continuous on a compact set.

More importantly for our aims, Theorem 3.5 enables us to prove Theorem
3.3 without using Theorem 3.2 .

###### Alternative proof of Theorem 3.3.

The proof runs similarly to that presented in Section 2. If @xmath is
measurable, without loss of generality, we can assume that @xmath is
non-negative and hence @xmath can be approximated pointwise by a
sequence of simple functions @xmath , which we know are nearly
continuous. Thus, for any @xmath , we can still construct the sequence
of closed subsets @xmath of @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath is
continuous in @xmath .

Now, as @xmath is finite a.e., Theorem 3.5 implies that it is nearly
bounded, that is we can find a closed subset @xmath of @xmath in which
@xmath is bounded and @xmath . We apply the second part of the Theorem
3.4 and infer that @xmath converges uniformly to @xmath in @xmath . As
seen before, we conclude that @xmath is continuous in the intersection
@xmath of all the @xmath ’s, because in @xmath it is the uniform limit
of the sequence of continuous functions @xmath . As before @xmath .

The reverse implication remains unchanged. ∎

In order to give our alternative proof of Theorem 3.2 , we need to
recall a classical result for sequences of continuous functions.

###### Theorem 3.7 (Dini).

Let @xmath be a compact subset of @xmath and let be given a sequence of
continuous functions @xmath that converges pointwise and monotonically
in @xmath to a function @xmath .

If @xmath is also continuous, then @xmath converges uniformly to @xmath
.

###### Proof.

We shall prove the theorem when @xmath is monotonically increasing.

For each @xmath , set @xmath ; as @xmath the continuos functions @xmath
decrease pointwise to @xmath on @xmath .

Fix @xmath . The sets @xmath are relatively open in @xmath , since the
@xmath ’s are continuous; also, @xmath for every @xmath , since the
@xmath ’s decrease; finally, the @xmath ’s cover @xmath , since the
@xmath converge pointwise to @xmath .

By compactness, @xmath is then covered by a finite number @xmath of the
@xmath ’s, which means that @xmath for some @xmath . This implies that
@xmath for all @xmath and @xmath , as desired. ∎

###### Remark 3.8.

The conclusion of Theorem 3.7 still holds true if we assume that the
sequence of @xmath ’s is increasing (respectively decreasing) and @xmath
and all the @xmath ’s are lower (respectively upper) semicontinuous. (We
say that @xmath is lower semicontinuous if the level sets @xmath are
open for every @xmath ; @xmath is upper semicontinuous if @xmath is
lower semicontinuous.)

Now, Theorem 3.2 can be proved by appealing to Theorems 3.3 and 3.7 .

###### Alternative proof of Theorem 3.2.

As in the classical proof of this theorem, we can always assume that
@xmath for every @xmath .

Consider the functions and sets defined in ( 3.1 ) and ( 3.2 ),
respectively. We shall first show that there exists an @xmath such that
@xmath is nearly bounded for every @xmath . In fact, as already
observed, since @xmath pointwise in @xmath as @xmath , we have that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the @xmath ’s increase with @xmath . Hence, if we fix @xmath , there
is a @xmath such that @xmath . Since @xmath is measurable, by Theorem
3.1 we can find a closed subset @xmath of @xmath such that @xmath .

Therefore, @xmath and for every @xmath

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now, being @xmath nearly bounded in @xmath for every @xmath , the
alternative proof of Theorem 3.3 implies that @xmath is nearly
continuous in @xmath , that is for every @xmath there exists a closed
subset @xmath of @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath is continuous on
@xmath . The set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

is closed, @xmath and on @xmath the functions @xmath are continuos for
any @xmath and monotonically descrease to @xmath as @xmath .

By Theorem 3.7 , the @xmath ’s converge to @xmath uniformly on @xmath .
This means that the @xmath ’s converge to @xmath uniformly on @xmath as
@xmath .

The reverse implication remains unchanged. ∎

###### Remark 3.9.

Egoroff’s theorem can be considered, in a sense, as the natural
substitute of Dini’s theorem, in case the monotonicity assumption is
removed. In fact, notice that the sequence of the @xmath ’s defined in (
3.1 ) is decreasing; however, the @xmath ’s are in general no longer
upper semicontinuous (they are only lower semicontinuous) and Dini’s
theorem (even in the form described in Remark 3.8 ) cannot be applied.
In spite of that, the @xmath ’s remain measurable if the @xmath ’s are
so.

Of course, all the proofs presented in Sections 2 and 3 still work if we
replace the real line @xmath by an Euclidean space of any dimension.
Theorems 3.2 , 3.3 and 3.5 can also be extended to general measure
spaces not necessarily endowed with a topology: the intersted reader can
refer to [ 2 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] and [ 14 ] .
