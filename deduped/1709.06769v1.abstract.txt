In this thesis we compute motivic classes of hypertoric varieties, Nakajima
quiver varieties and open de Rham spaces in a certain localization of the
Grothendieck ring of varieties. Furthermore we study the $p$-adic pushforward
of the Haar measure under a hypertoric moment map $\mu$. This leads to an
explicit formula for the Igusa zeta function $I_\mu(s)$ of $\mu$, and in
particular to a small set of candidate poles for $I_\mu(s)$. We also study
various properties of the residue at the largest pole of $I_\mu(s)$. Finally,
if $\mu$ is constructed out of a quiver $\Gamma$ we give a conjectural
description of this residue in terms of indecomposable representations of
$\Gamma$ over finite depth rings.
  The connections between these different results is the method of proof. At
the heart of each theorem lies a motivic or $p$-adic volume computation, which
is only possible due to some surprising cancellations. These cancellations are
reminiscent of a result in classical symplectic geometry by Duistermaat and
Heckman on the localization of the Liouville measure, hence the title of the
thesis.
