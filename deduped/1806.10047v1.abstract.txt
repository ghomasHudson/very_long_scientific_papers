We develop a number of variants of Lifschitz realizability for CZF by
building topological models internally in certain realizability models. We use
this to show some interesting metamathematical results about constructive set
theory with variants of LLPO including consistency with unique Church's thesis,
consistency with some Brouwerian principles and variants of the numerical
existence property.
