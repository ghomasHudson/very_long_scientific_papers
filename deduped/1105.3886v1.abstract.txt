Let M be a smooth closed manifold and T*M its cotangent bundle endowed with
the usual symplectic structure. A hypersurface S in T*M is said to be fiberwise
starshaped if for each point q in M the intersection of S with the fiber at q
is starshaped with respect to the origin. In this thesis we give lower bounds
of the growth rate of the number of closed Reeb orbits on a fiberwise
starshaped hypersurface in terms of the topology of the free loop space of M.
We distinguish the two cases that the fundamental group of the base space M has
an exponential growth of conjugacy classes or not. If the base space M is
simply connected we generalize the theorem of Ballmann and Ziller on the growth
of closed geodesics to Reeb flows.
