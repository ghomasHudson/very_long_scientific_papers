This thesis describes the development of some basic mathematical tools of
wide relevance to mathematical physics. Transmission and reflection
coefficients are associated with quantum tunneling phenomena, while Bogoliubov
coefficients are associated with the mathematically related problem of
excitations of a parametric oscillator. While many approximation techniques for
these quantities are known, very little is known about rigorous upper and lower
bounds. In this thesis four separate problems relating to rigorous bounds on
transmission, reflection and Bogoliubov coefficients are considered, divided
into four separate themes:
  1) Bounding the Bogoliubov coefficients;
  2) Bounding the greybody factors for Schwarzschild black holes;
  3) Transformation probabilities and the Miller--Good transformation;
  4) Analytic bounds on transmission probabilities.
