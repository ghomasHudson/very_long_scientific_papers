The present thesis is devoted to the reconstruction of the dark energy models
using diverse observational data sets. The parametric approach has been adopted
for the reconstruction of cosmological models. The reconstruction of
kinematical quantities and the possibility of interaction between dark energy
and dark matter has also been emphasised. In first chapter, a brief
introduction to cosmology has been presented. In the second chapter, a
reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state parameter for a
quintessence scalar field model has been discussed. In the third chapter, a
parametric reconstruction of the effective or total equation of state has been
discussed. In the fourth chapter, a kinematic approach in the reconstruction of
dark energy model through the parametrization of the cosmological jerk
parameter has been discussed. The fifth chapter is also about a kinematic
approach to the reconstruction of dark energy. The reconstruction has been done
with an assumption that the jerk parameter is a very slowly varying function.
The sixth chapter is devoted to the reconstruction of the interaction rate in
holographic dark energy model. Finally, chapter seven contains the concluding
remarks and relevant discussions regarding the overall work presented in the
thesis.
