In this paper, we set up a general framework to compute the exact
multiplicity with which certain automorphic representations appear in
both the cuspidal and Eisenstein cohomology of locally symmetric spaces.
We apply this machinery to Eisenstein series on @xmath and split @xmath
. In the case of @xmath , we will also obtain new information about the
archimedean components of certain CAP representations using Arthurâ€™s
conjectures.
