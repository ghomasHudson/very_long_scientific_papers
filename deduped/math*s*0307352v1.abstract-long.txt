The Ramanujan sum @xmath and @xmath , the @xmath th coefficient of the
@xmath th cyclotomic polynomial, are completely symmetric expressions in
terms of primitive @xmath th roots of unity. For @xmath fixed we study
the value distribution of @xmath (following A. Wintner) and @xmath
(partly following H. Möller). In particular we disprove a 1970
conjecture of H. Möller on the average (over @xmath ) of @xmath . We
show that certain symmetric functions in primitive roots considered by
the Dence brothers are related to the behaviour of @xmath and @xmath as
@xmath ranges over the primes and study their value distribution.
This paper is an outgrowth of the M.Sc. thesis project of the second
author, carried out under the supervision of the first author at the
Korteweg-de Vries Institute (University of Amsterdam). Some of the
numerical work described was done by Yves Gallot.
