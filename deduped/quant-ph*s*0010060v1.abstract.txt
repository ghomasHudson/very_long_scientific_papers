In this thesis I present a short review of ideas in quantum information
theory. The first chapter contains introductory material, sketching the central
ideas of probability and information theory. Quantum mechanics is presented at
the level of advanced undergraduate knowledge, together with some useful tools
for quantum mechanics of open systems. In the second chapter I outline how
classical information is represented in quantum systems and what this means for
agents trying to extract information from these systems. The final chapter
presents a new resource: quantum information. This resource has some
bewildering applications which have been discovered in the last ten years, and
continually presents us with unexpected insights into quantum theory and the
universe.
  The treatment is pedagogical and suitable for beginning graduates in the
field.
