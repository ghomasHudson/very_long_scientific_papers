This thesis presents an experimental study of the inverse energy cascade as
it occurs in an electromagnetically forced soap film. It focuses on
characterizing important features of the inverse cascade such as it's range,
how energy is distributed over the range and how energy flows through the
range. The thesis also probes the assumption of scale invariance that is
associated with the existence of an inverse cascade. These investigations
demonstrate that the extent of the inverse cascade range and the behavior of
the energy distribution are in agreement with dimensional predictions. The
energy flow in the inverse cascade range is shown to be well described by exact
mathematical predictions obtained from the Navier-Stokes equation. At no time
does the energy flow in the inverse cascade range produced by the e-m cell
behave inertially or in a scale invariant manner. Evidence that the cascade
could become scale invariant should an inertial range develop is presented, as
are the requirements that a system must satisfy to create such an inertial
range.
