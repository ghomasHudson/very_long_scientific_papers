We introduce a strategy based on
Kustin–Miller unprojection that allows us to construct many hundreds of
Gorenstein codimension 4 ideals with @xmath resolutions (that is, 9
equations and 16 first syzygies). Our two basic games are called Tom and
Jerry; the main application is the biregular construction of most of the
anticanonically polarised Mori Fano 3-folds of Altınok’s thesis [ A0 ] .
There are 115 cases whose numerical data (in effect, the Hilbert series)
allow a Type I projection. In every case, at least one Tom and one Jerry
construction works, providing at least two deformation families of
quasismooth Fano 3-folds having the same numerics but different
topology.
