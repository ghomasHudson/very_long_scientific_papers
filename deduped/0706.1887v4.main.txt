## Chapter 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation and general introduction

#### 1.1.1 General Introduction

The physics of today knows four fundamental forces acting on elementary
particles. Three of these forces, namely the strong color interaction
and the electroweak interaction (which unifies the electromagnetic with
the weak interaction) can be well described by the quantum field theory
(QFT) known as the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. The fourth
force in league is gravitation, which is described classically
(nonquantized) by the theory of General Relativity (GR).
The quantum field theories of the Standard Model are gauge field
theories. Gauge fields (e.g. the electromagnetic four potential @xmath )
are needed in order to construct gauge covariant derivatives (e.g.
@xmath ) rendering the Lagrangian of the QFT invariant under the action
of local symmetry transformations of the matter fields. These gauge
transformations form groups.
In contrast to the gauge group U(1) of quantum electrodynamics (QED),
the gauge group SU(N=3) @xmath of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is
non-abelian. This leads to an interaction between the QCD gauge bosons
(gluons). At low energies the coupling constant @xmath for the
interaction between quarks and gluons is large, which leads to quark
confinement, while it is small for high energies, leading to an
asymptotic freedom of quarks.
One standard tool used in QFT is perturbation theory which is applicable
for small perturbations of the free system i.e. small coupling
constants. In the perturbative calculations of Yang-Mills (YM) theories
one usually uses expansions in powers of the YM coupling constant @xmath
. So far the Standard Model works well at small couplings, while the
strong coupling behaviour is understood less well, accessible
non-perturbatively today only via numeric computations on a discretised
spacetime lattice.
The situation is different for gravitation. Being a classical theory, GR
works well at large length scales corresponding to low energies. Yet a
microscopical description of spacetime at lengths near the Planck scale
or energies near the Planck energy requires a quantum theory of gravity.
The most famous example of large gravitational energies are the
spacetime regions near the horizons of black holes.
Several candidates for theories unifying the Standard Model and gravity
with or without supersymmetry are provided by different string theories.
While in the Standard Model elementary particles are considered to be
pointlike and to interact locally, string theories considers them as
one-dimensional extended objects: strings. These strings can oscillate
and different modes of oscillation correspond to different particles.
String theories also make use of perturbation theory and thus work well
if the coupling constant @xmath for interactions between strings is
small. Supersymmetric string theories live in ten dimensions, from which
four-dimensional spacetime can be obtained via compactifying six
dimensions.
We see, that in both Yang-Mills and string theories perturbative
expansions are usually done in powers of the coupling constant @xmath
respectively @xmath .
However, as discovered by ’t Hooft [ 21 ] , in YM-theories one can also
perform expansions in powers of @xmath . He hoped that one could solve
the theories for @xmath and then perform an expansion in @xmath with the
value @xmath of the standard model. In addition to this expansion
Feynman graphs can be classified in powers of @xmath . For YM-theories a
perturbative expansion in @xmath is possible in the ’t Hooft limit where
@xmath with @xmath kept fixed. In this limit only the Feynman graphs of
topological genus zero survive (i.e. those which can be drawn on a
sphere without crossing lines in double line notation).
The form of the @xmath expansion series of the YM-theories is the same
as one finds in a perturbative theory with closed oriented strings if
one identifies @xmath with @xmath . Because of this resemblance a
relation between YM and string theories was conjectured.
The AdS/CFT correspondence is a candidate for such a relation and thus
an example of the phenomenon named duality, which states that a theory
can possess (usually two) different descriptions. This can be very
useful if one description is weakly coupled in a regime where the other
description is strongly coupled, because then one can apply perturbation
theory for both low and high energies. The AdS/CFT duality was
conjectured by Maldacena [ 22 ] and states that a four-dimensional
supersymmetric SU(N) @xmath -Yang-Mills theory describes the same
physics as (type IIB) string theory on an AdS @xmath S @xmath background
(which is shortly referred to as AdS in this section). @xmath is the
number of certain charges of the YM theory, namely the four-spinor
supercharges, while @xmath denotes the number of colors in the SU(N)
Yang-Mills theory, which we had found to be three for the Standard
Model. This YM theory is a conformally invariant field theory (CFT).
The contents of AdS/CFT is that each supergravity field (which is
derived from string theory) propagating on AdS @xmath S is in a one to
one correspondence with an operator in the CFT on the conformal boundary
of AdS @xmath S.
The AdS/CFT correspondence relates the masses of supergravity fields
with the conformal dimensions of the CFT operators. A field @xmath of a
CFT has the scaling dimension @xmath if under spacetime scalings @xmath
it transforms as @xmath . CFT operators @xmath are constructed from
traces of the CFT fields @xmath and their derivatives:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The conformal dimension of a CFT operator is the sum of the scaling
dimensions of its constituting fields plus quantum corrections and the
two-point function of operators behaves like

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

In [ 1 ] one finds that the geometry of the string theory background (in
a near horizon limit) is determined by the metric

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

which via the substitution @xmath taken from [ 27 ] transforms into:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

This is the metric of AdS @xmath S @xmath spacetime in Poincaré
coordinates with the radii of curvature @xmath . Moreover in [ 1 ] one
finds a relation between @xmath and the string length @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Herein @xmath is the string coupling which is not a constant as in QFT
but a dynamical variable depending on the expectation value of the
scalar dilaton field @xmath which is contained in all 10-dimensional
String Theories:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now the perturbative analysis of the Yang-Mills theory is valid in the
case of small couplings

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

while the supergravity description via type IIB string theory is valid
for the opposite case of small curvature corresponding to a large radius
of AdS and the sphere:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus both descriptions complement each other. Each one works fine in its
perturbative regime and can be used as a tool in order to research the
regime of strong coupling in the other description.
The AdS/CFT correspondence is supposed to hold on both string and field
side for all values of @xmath , but up to now only the duality between
large @xmath on the string side and small @xmath on the field side can
be tested via perturbative methods.
More detailed overviews and introductions for the AdS/CFT correspondence
can be found in [ 1 ] in chapters 1.1, 1.2 and 3.1 and in chapters 1 and
1.2 of [ 27 ] . Above the main points discussed therein are outlined
briefly.

#### 1.1.2 Motivation

On the string side of the correspondence supergravity fields are
propagating on the AdS @xmath S  background and therefore their
propagator functions are an essential tool. The bulk-to-bulk propagator
of the complete AdS @xmath S  background is a subject of interest
because in pure AdS the boundary-to-bulk propagator can be derived from
it and this may also hold for AdS @xmath S  . The bulk-to-bulk
propagator for AdS @xmath S  has not yet been constructed for arbitrary
values of mass. It has however been constructed in the limit of a plane
wave background but therefrom the boundary-to-bulk propagator cannot be
derived because the boundary is not lying within the region which
converges to the plane wave. This situation is sketched in figure 1.1 .
A plane wave background is a metric which is a solution of Einstein’s
equation without matter representing plane gravitational waves [ 7 ] .
From the AdS background it can be obtained via a process called Penrose
limit. In @xmath -dimensional spacetime a plane wave background has
@xmath continuous symmetries: @xmath translations and 2 rotations.
The organization of the thesis is as follows: in subsection 2.1.1 we
compile the well known standard relations between the various propagator
functions and in subsection 2.1.2 we review in Minkowski spacetime the
well known standard procedure for finding the propagator functions in
momentum space.
Dorn, Salizzoni and Sieg in [ 17 ] calculate scalar bulk-to-bulk
propagators for AdS @xmath S @xmath up to a time dependent @xmath
-prescription. Therefore in subsection 2.1.3 we review in
fourdimensional Minkowski spacetime a configuration space method
presented by Dullemond and van Beveren (DvB) in [ 18 ] . This method can
be applied in various constantly curved spacetimes in order to find all
propagators including the appropriate @xmath -term. In subsection 2.2 we
review their method for AdS @xmath and extend it slightly to @xmath
-dimensional AdS @xmath .
Since also a dS/CFT duality has been conjectured by Strominger in [ 29 ]
in subsection 2.3 we also apply the DvB method to de Sitter spacetime dS
@xmath of arbitrary dimension @xmath .
In sections 1.2 and 1.3 we also review and examine basic geometric
properties of AdS and dS spacetime: different coordinate systems and
their metrics, chordal distances, relations between conformal dimensions
@xmath and the mass @xmath of the scalar field, geodesics and the
invariance of time ordering are examined and compiled from various
sources.

### 1.2 Basic properties of Anti de Sitter spacetime

#### 1.2.1 Coordinate systems

An Anti de Sitter space AdS is a homogeneous isotropic space with
constant negative curvature. @xmath -dimensional Anti de Sitter space
AdS @xmath can be realized as a hyperboloid in a @xmath -dimensional
embedding space with the indefinite metric

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

The overall sign @xmath is a purely conventional choice but is
maintained for the convenience of the reader (and the author). Doing so
shall facilitate the comparison of different publications and mark where
the choice of @xmath leads to sign changes and where not. Cartesian
coordinates for a point X in the embedding space are given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the @xmath -dimensional d’Alembertian in embedding space is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

with indices in Latin upper cases running within @xmath . AdS @xmath
then corresponds to a hyperboloid in embedding space with

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Figure 1.2 shows such a hyperboloid for the case of AdS @xmath .

For the embedding space we can introduce several systems of radial
coordinates, from which AdS emerges by demoting the radial coordinate
@xmath to a constant parameter @xmath .

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.7)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

In figure 1.2 the circles running around the hyperboloid are lines of
constant @xmath and @xmath and the hyperbolae are lines of constant time
@xmath . We can read off, that the topology of AdS @xmath is @xmath [ 3
] . Therefore we are faced with closed timelike curves.
The point @xmath with @xmath in the embedding space is the origin @xmath
of AdS ( @xmath is a winding number to be defined soon). The antipodal
point @xmath of a point @xmath on the hyperboloid in embedding space is
unique: @xmath . Yet on there exist two possibilities of traveling to
the antipodal point in direction of either increasing or decreasing time
@xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.8)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

All of the coordinate sets given above are global coordinates, because
at constant radius they cover the whole AdS hyperboloid. For this
purpose it is sufficient to have @xmath with the points at @xmath and
@xmath identified.

Figure 1.3 is the Penrose diagram of this AdS hyperboloid in the
conformal @xmath coordinates. The dashed grey lines at @xmath indicate
the identification of these points. The coordinate @xmath is nonnegative
by definition, the left half of the diagrams with @xmath increasing
leftward shows the half of the hyperboloid with @xmath and the part with
@xmath increasing rightward shows the other one. In dimensions @xmath
each point on the hyperboloid represents a sphere S @xmath of radius
@xmath and the halves of the diagram correspond to the southern and
northern hemisphere.
The left diagram shows the lightcone of the reference point @xmath ,
situated at the origin of AdS, and its antipode point @xmath . The
diagram on the right is drawn for a arbitrary reference point sitting
somewhere else. Lightrays travel at angles of @xmath and the orange
regions are the spacelike part of the lightcone while all other parts
are timelike regions. However we will see in subsection 1.2.4 that only
the white yet not the grey parts can be reached from @xmath via a
geodesic. This illustrates that AdS is not geodesically convex [ 19 ]
i.e. geodesics originating at an arbitrary point do not cover the entire
spacetime. (Geodesically convex is meant in the sense that any two
points of a manifold can be connected by a geodesic. This is sometimes
also called a geodesically complete manifold, however there exists a
different definition of geodesical completeness and therefore we will
use the term geodesically convex.)
As we will see in 1.2.5 , due to the fact that the hyperboloid is closed
in direction of @xmath , and one encounters closed timelike curves, we
therefor have to introduce a special way of time ordering. This leads to
the somewhat awkward picture that in the diagram on the right points
with @xmath ’behind’ the antipode point @xmath need to be considered to
be earlier in time than @xmath itself.
We also see another apparent feature of AdS presented by Avis, Isham and
Storey in [ 3 ] wherein also the Penrose diagrams can be found:
lightlike geodesics starting at @xmath reach the conformal boundary
@xmath representing spatial infinity within finite coordinate time
@xmath . Thus initial data from a spacelike hypersurface can propagate
to spatial infinity in finite time. Vice versa data from the timelike
conformal boundary at spatial infinity can influence the interior of
AdS. This illustrates that AdS is not globally hyperbolic: (the
intersection of an arbitrary point’s future with another arbitrary
point’s past is not necessarily compact, which implies that) the causal
future of a Cauchy surface is not entirely determined by the equations
of motion plus the initial data on the Cauchy surface.
Whenever not otherwise indicated, we refer to AdS as the universal
covering space of the hyperboloid obtained by ’unwrapping’ the circle
@xmath i.e. extending the range of @xmath to @xmath . Then @xmath is
many valued in embedding space and serves as time variable in AdS
spacetime. The topology of universal covering AdS @xmath is the same as
for @xmath -dimensional Minkowski spacetime: @xmath .

The conformal boundary of AdS @xmath is formed by all points with @xmath
and has the topology of @xmath for the hyperboloid and @xmath for the
universal cover. Figure 1.4 shows the Penrose diagram of universal
covering AdS. The green curve represents a timelike geodesic. All
timelike geodesics starting from a reference point @xmath intersect
again at all points @xmath and @xmath of AdS, which by the coordinate
systems ( 1.7 ) are mapped to either the point Y or its antipode point
on the hyperboloid in embedding space (see section 1.2.4 ).
Figure 1.5 illustrates the form of the lightcones one the AdS
hyperboloid. Subfigures (a), (c) and (e) on the left show the lightcones
of the AdS origin while (b), (d) and (f) one the right are plotted for
an arbitrary reference point. The spacelike regions are kept in sunny
orange again and the timelike ones in emerald green. The lightcones are
cut out of the hyperboloid by a plane in embedding space containing our
reference point and being perpendicular (with respect to the metric of
embedding space) to the vector pointing from embedding space origin
towards the reference point.

@xmath and @xmath are sets of spatial coordinates in AdS. For the @xmath
and @xmath coordinates we choose standard spherical coordinates for the
@xmath -sphere @xmath which e.g. can be found in [ 28 ] and [ 27 ] :

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The inverted relations are:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.9)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.10)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.11)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.12)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.13)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

wherein we finally have introduced the coordinate winding number @xmath
. Half a turn around the hyperboloid in the direction of
increasing(decreasing) @xmath increases(decreases) @xmath by @xmath . So
every point of AdS is uniquely defined by its coordinates in embedding
space and its coordinate winding number.
Moreover there also exists a patchwise coordinate system called Poincaré
patch, in which the metric takes a particularly simple form:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --

The inverted relations are:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

We see that the Poincaré coordinates are not well defined for @xmath .
The patch with @xmath covers the one half of the hyperboloid with @xmath
and the patch with @xmath covers the other half @xmath . Poincaré
coordinates (nearly) cover the hyperboloid once. Thus in order to avoid
closed timelike curves again we need to introduce a universal covering
(e.g. by introducing a coordinate winding number in some way).

Figure 1.6 shows the AdS hyperboloid in Poincaré coordinates. 1.6 (b)
demonstrates (drawn slightly exaggerated) how the @xmath - plane
separates the two patches.

Figure 1.7 is the Penrose diagram of AdS showing the coordinate lines of
Poincaré coordinates for the two patches. The green curves are lines of
constant @xmath and the orange ones of constant @xmath . If in our mind
we vertically roll up the diagram as a cylinder gluing together the
lines of @xmath and @xmath , then we obtain a flattened version of the
AdS hyperboloid covered by Poincaré coordinates. The negative value of
@xmath is symbolically only and indicates negative values of @xmath .
In the Poincaré coordinates there is no origin because of @xmath . We
just find that @xmath corresponds to @xmath with @xmath .
In Poincaré coordinates we find for the antipodal point:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

In the following considerations we will often switch between regarding
AdS as a self-contained spacetime and using viewpoints of embedding
space.

##### Chordal distance

The chordal distance @xmath of two points @xmath and @xmath in AdS is
defined as the squared distance of their corresponding points @xmath and
@xmath on the hyperboloid in embedding space:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.14)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.15)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

In some publications these definition include a factor of @xmath on the
right hand side which we avoid. @xmath is called antipodal chordal
distance. Both chordal distances are unique on the hyperboloid, periodic
on the universal cover and SO @xmath -invariant.
When written without arguments, the chordal distances are meant to refer
to the arguments @xmath as above. There exist a few simple relations [
17 ] between them on AdS:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.16)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.17)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

#### 1.2.2 AdS metrics

The squared infinitesimal length element is

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (1.18)
              @xmath      (1.19)
              @xmath      (1.20)
              @xmath      (1.21)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

wherein indices in Latin lower cases are running within @xmath and
@xmath is the infinitesimal line element on the unit sphere @xmath . In
standard spherical coordinates @xmath reads:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Metric ( 1.19 ) is conformally equivalent to the metric of the spacetime
known as Einstein static universe (ESU). Therefore we refer to @xmath as
conformal coordinates. Thus the time @xmath used in the first three
coordinate systems is also called conformal time variable.
The @xmath -dimensional Einstein static universe ESU @xmath has the
topological structure @xmath (full real axis and complete sphere). Since
for AdS we only have @xmath (and not @xmath as for the ESU) we see that
AdS @xmath can be conformally mapped into one half of ESU @xmath [ 3 ] .
The metric ( 1.21 ) in Poincaré coordinates is conformally flat and thus
@xmath is a conformal time variable.
The metrics of all four coordinate systems are static. This is the
reason why both vectors @xmath and @xmath are killing vectors. This is
important because Killing vectors of time variables generate a symmetry
in time translation and thus can be used for defining the Hamiltonian. A
vector @xmath is a Killing vector if it fulfills the Killing equation
which we can find e.g. in [ 24 ] by Nakahara:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the induced metric of the @xmath coordinate set we find with indices
in greek lower cases running within @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.23)
     @xmath               (1.24)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.25)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.26)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.27)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.28)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The d’Alembertian on AdS then is

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (1.29)
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

and the Christoffel symbols (independent of @xmath ) read

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.30)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.31)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.32)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.33)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.34)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

#### 1.2.3 Conformal dimension and mass term in AdS

In [ 23 ] Mezincescu and Townsend show for AdS @xmath spacetime that the
squared mass @xmath of a scalar field fulfills the equation:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the two solutions

  -- -- -- --------
           (1.36)
  -- -- -- --------

This @xmath is the conformal dimension (conformal weight) of a CFT field
that via AdS/CFT correspondence is related to a scalar field with mass
@xmath on AdS, see [ 15 ] eq.(6.8), [ 17 ] eq.(9).
In order to obtain a positive definite energy for our scalar field,
@xmath needs to be real. This yields the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

When working with @xmath , one has to use an alternative improved
definition of the energy, which differs from the conventional definition
by a surface term [ 23 ] .
Moreover the conformal weight is bounded from below by the unitary bound

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

For values below the unitary bound the corresponding representation of
the symmetry group @xmath ceases to be unitary [ 9 ] . This bound is
also necessary for the conservation of energy. Hence we can easily check
[ 17 ] that both @xmath and @xmath are allowed for mass values

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

but only @xmath is allowed for masses

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

In [ 9 ] Breitenlohner and Freedman find (explicitly for the case of
@xmath ) that the regular definition of the energy functional converges
only if the field vanishes at spatial infinity where @xmath faster than

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

and that the improved version converges if the field vanishes faster
than

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

If the scalar is propagated by the conformal wave operator, then the
conformal mass value is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

which for @xmath is negative.

#### 1.2.4 Geodesics in AdS

In this section we engage in finding geodesics for AdS @xmath spacetime.
We begin considering an arbitrary curve @xmath with contour parameter
@xmath on the hyperboloid ( 1.6 ) in embedding space:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.44)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.45)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.46)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Since ( 1.45 ) is true for all curves passing the point @xmath on the
hyperboloid we know that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

holds for all vectors @xmath in the tangent space of the point @xmath of
AdS. By definition a curve in embedding space is called:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.48)
     @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

We can decompose the vector @xmath into a vector @xmath living in the
tangent space @xmath and another vector @xmath which does not live
there:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.49)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Using the radial @xmath coordinates for the embedding space we have:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

The wanted curve is a geodesic running on the hyperboloid @xmath const.
and therefore @xmath is zero. We now take @xmath as an affine parameter.
The metric of the embedding space is block diagonal for all three
coordinate sets:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

Hence @xmath also vanishes. Along a geodesic we know that the length of
the tangent vector is constant:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus for a curve in embedding space which is a geodesic in AdS we have

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

Moreover ( 1.51 ) also implies @xmath and therefore

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

Together with ( 1.47 ) this means that @xmath must be parallel to @xmath
:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

Plugging ( 1.54 ) and ( 1.52 ) in ( 1.46 ) we find:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

For timelike geodesics we have @xmath and therefore obtain:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

Plugging this into ( 1.44 ) and then evaluating for @xmath we find that
the vectors @xmath and @xmath are constrained by:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

For spacelike geodesics we have @xmath and find:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

Plugging into ( 1.44 ) and evaluating for @xmath we find the
constraints:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

For nullgeodesics we have @xmath which leads to @xmath . Hence lightlike
geodesics on AdS are just straight lines in embedding space and via (
1.52 ) they are also (lightlike) geodesics in the sense of embedding
space. In contrast, timelike (spacelike) geodesics in AdS remain
timelike (spacelike) but are not geodesics in embedding space.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

Plugging into ( 1.44 ) and evaluating for @xmath this time we encounter
the constraints:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Planes in embedding space spanned by two vectors @xmath and @xmath and
docked at the point @xmath are described by @xmath . Therefore all three
equations ( 1.56 ), ( 1.57 ) and ( 1.58 ) say that geodesics of AdS run
in planes in embedding space which contain the origin and are spanned by
the pseudoorthogonal vectors @xmath and @xmath .
The AdS geodesics are the intersection lines of these planes and the
hyperboloid. Timelike geodesics form ellipses in embedding space,
lightlike geodesics are lines and spacelike geodesics are hyperbolae.
This section is based on computations taken from [ 16 ] by Dorn and the
results are in agreement with Fronsdal [ 19 ] .
The geodesics of AdS are drawn in figure 1.8 . The subfigures on the
left half show geodesics running through the AdS origin and those on the
right half show geodesics through an arbitrary point. Green background
indicates timelike geodesics, orange background marks the spacelike
geodesics running through the origin/arbitrary point and grey background
the spacelike ones through its antipode point. The black curves running
through these points are geodesics (i.e. the closed ellipses on green
and the hyperbolae on orange/grey, while other coloured sets of curves
are auxiliary lines only). The two subfigures at the bottom give a view
”from below” (i.e. from a point sitting in the deep on the @xmath
-axis).
Comparing the subfigures on the right half with figure 1.6 one can
recognize that the two regions of the Poincaré patch are the regions
covered by the spacelike geodesics through the point @xmath respectively
its antipode point. These spacelike geodesics correspond to the green
curves of constant @xmath in figure 1.7 .

#### 1.2.5 Time ordering on AdS

In this section we check the invariance of time ordering in AdS under
the action of SO @xmath . First we consider time ordering on the
hyperboloid and continue with the covering space. The computations again
follow Dorn [ 16 ] .

##### Time ordering for AdS: Hyperboloid

Trouble with time ordering on the hyperboloid is caused by having closed
timelike curves. Therefore time ordering a priori in general cannot be
transitive e.g. point a is later then c is later then b which in turn is
later then a.

Figure 1.9 shows the projection of three points in AdS into the @xmath
-plane. With @xmath ranging within @xmath on the hyperboloid the values
of @xmath lie within @xmath . We assign a time order to two points
@xmath and @xmath in AdS by defining that @xmath is @xmath than @xmath
if the time variable @xmath @xmath (except at the identified point
@xmath where @xmath jumps discontinuously) while going from @xmath to
@xmath in the shortest possible way on the circle.
This corresponds to either @xmath or @xmath or compactly combined @xmath
. This again means that in order to ensure the invariance of time
ordering on the hyperboloid we have to show the invariance of @xmath
under SO @xmath . Defining

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.59)
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

we see that @xmath . Therefore we now only need to check the invariance
of @xmath for causally connected points under boosts in the (0,1)-plane.
Boosts in the other (0,k)-planes and (k,d)-planes are analogue and
rotations in the (0,d)-plane or a (j,k)-plane trivially leave @xmath
invariant. @xmath is a scalar product and thereby SO @xmath invariant.
With @xmath being @xmath boosted by the boost matrix @xmath of rapidity
@xmath we have:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath               (1.60)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.61)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Two considered points @xmath and @xmath on the hyperboloid surely are
causally connected if there exists a timelike geodesic connection
between them. From section ( 1.2.4 ) we know that timelike geodesics are
ellipses given by the intersection of the hyperboloid with a
two-dimensional plane fixed by the origin and the two points @xmath and
@xmath . Hence timelike geodesics fulfill both

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.62)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.63)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

wherein the parameter vectors @xmath and @xmath are fixed by the points
@xmath and @xmath . For a timelike geodesic @xmath with affine contour
parameter @xmath we know that @xmath by definition along all points of
the geodesic. Using ( 1.63 ) we find:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.64)
              @xmath      (1.65)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Since timelike geodesics are closed ellipses on the hyperboloid, each of
them passes points with @xmath and other points with @xmath . Looking at
@xmath at a point with @xmath we can read off from ( 1.64 ) that @xmath
and looking at points with @xmath we find that @xmath . Then for @xmath
and @xmath connected by a timelike geodesic we can compute for a boost
in the (0,1)-plane:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (1.66)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Thus @xmath , which shows that @xmath is invariant under SO @xmath for
points on the hyperboloid which are connected by a timelike geodesic.

However, as drawn in figure 1.10 , there also exist causally connected
points like @xmath and @xmath which cannot be connected by a timelike
geodesic. Nevertheless we can always connect these points via two
timelike geodesics connected at an intermediate point @xmath . For these
the time order is invariant, and since the relations @xmath are
transitive, time ordering is also SO @xmath -invariant for causally but
non-geodesically connected points:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Thus the action of the AdS invariant time ordering operator @xmath for a
field @xmath reads:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (1.67)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

This agrees with the results published by Castell [ 13 ] wherein the
nontransitivity of this time ordering is already stated: from @xmath and
@xmath we cannot conclude that @xmath .
We can also write time ordering in an alternative way using the
intervals discussed above equation( 1.59 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (1.68)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

We could freely add a step function for the condition @xmath . However
there is no need for doing so since for @xmath it is always equal to one
and it also makes no difference for the production of delta sources
considered in section B.1 .

##### Time ordering for AdS: Universal cover

The problem with time ordering on the hyperboloid is not caused by the
absence of a direction of time but by the presence of closed timelike
curves. Since timelike curves are open on the universal cover we are not
faced with this problem here.
In order to demonstrate the invariance of standard @xmath time ordering
we now need to to show, that for a timelike curve @xmath in AdS the
direction of the growing contour parameter @xmath is SO @xmath
invariant. Here a growing contour parameter can be pointing either in or
against the direction of time @xmath . The sense of the time arrow in
the @xmath -plane is chosen counterclockwise in the direction of growing
@xmath .

For the rest of this section we use the notation @xmath . Figure 1.11
shows the projection of a curve @xmath in AdS into the @xmath -plane.
The dashed line is perpendicular to the coordinate line of @xmath in the
considered point. The tangent vector @xmath is pointing @xmath the
direction of time if @xmath i.e. if @xmath . We find:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath   @xmath      (1.69)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

@xmath is the area of the parallelogram spanned by @xmath and @xmath
bearing analogy with the vector product in three dimensions.
For a timelike curve @xmath must be strictly monotonic and the contour
parameter @xmath is pointing @xmath the direction of time if @xmath is
strictly monotonic @xmath i.e. if @xmath . In equation ( 1.69 ) we see
that the signs of @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are the same.
But the proof that @xmath is SO @xmath invariant runs parallel to the
proof for @xmath in the previous section. Therefore the growing contour
parameter @xmath is SO @xmath -invariantly pointing in the same
chronological direction.
We choose @xmath and with this natural choice the action of the
AdS-invariant time ordering operator @xmath for a field @xmath reads:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (1.70)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

If we choose @xmath to only point in the direction of time but without
being identical with @xmath , then in ( 1.2.5 ) we simply have to
replace @xmath by @xmath .

### 1.3 Basic properties of de Sitter spacetime

In this section we consider basic geometric properties of de Sitter
spacetime. It is held in the same style and sequence as section 1.2 with
the intention being that the similarities and differences between AdS
and dS shall conveniently be seen.

#### 1.3.1 Coordinate systems

A de Sitter space dS is a homogeneous isotropic space with constant
positive curvature. @xmath -dimensional de Sitter space dS @xmath can be
realized as a hyperboloid in a @xmath -dimensional embedding space with
the indefinite metric

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

The overall sign @xmath again is only conventional choice but will be
maintained throughout our considerations. Cartesian coordinates for a
point X in the embedding space are given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.72)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the @xmath -dimensional d’Alembertian in embedding space is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

with indices in Latin upper cases running within @xmath . dS @xmath then
corresponds to a hyperboloid in embedding space with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.74)
  -- -------- -- --------

Figure 1.12 shows such a hyperboloid for the case of dS @xmath .

For the embedding space we can introduce several systems of radial
coordinates from which dS emerges by demoting the radial coordinate
@xmath to a constant parameter @xmath . In [ 28 ] many coordinate
systems (and also a lot of other basic properties) of dS spacetime are
presented. Here we consider three of them and later also a fourth one.

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.75)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

In figure 1.12 the circles running around the hyperboloid are lines of
constant time variables @xmath and @xmath and the hyperbolae are lines
of constant @xmath . Following [ 28 ] we refer to @xmath as global
coordinates because they cover the whole hyperboloid and to @xmath as
conformal coordinates. @xmath and @xmath are spatial coordinates in dS.
We can read off, that the topology of dS @xmath is @xmath . Therefore we
are not faced with closed timelike curves. The conformal boundary of dS
@xmath is formed by all points with @xmath and its topology is that of
two spheres @xmath .
The point @xmath in embedding space is the origin of deSitter spacetime:
@xmath . The antipodal point @xmath of a point @xmath on the hyperboloid
in embedding space is unique: @xmath .

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.76)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

For the @xmath coordinates, we use standard spherical coordinates as in
subsection 1.2.1 , but here for a @xmath -sphere @xmath and in modified
sequence:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath               
     @xmath   @xmath               
     @xmath   @xmath               (1.77)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Our South Pole is sitting at @xmath and the North pole sits at @xmath .
Since the sequence of the @xmath is exactly the other way round in [ 28
] , the South Pole therein sits at @xmath and the North Pole at @xmath .
Except from this definition, our embedding space notation is the same as
the one used therein.

Figure 1.13 is the Penrose diagram of dS with the conformal time
variable @xmath (linear) and @xmath (nonlinear) at the vertical axis.
The angular variable @xmath is pointing leftward (linearly) and thus
@xmath points rightward (nonlinearly). Lightrays travel at angles of
@xmath and the dashed grey lines are the lightcone of a point with
@xmath and @xmath . In contrast to AdS, de Sitter spacetime is globally
hyperbolic.
The spacelike hypersurfaces @xmath are the conformal boundaries at
future and past infinity. North and South Pole appear as timelike lines
in the diagram and each correspond to a single point on the sphere
whereas each point in the interior of the diagram represents a subsphere
S @xmath .

Figure 1.14 is the same Penrose diagram. The left diagram shows the past
lightcone @xmath and the right one the futur lightcone @xmath of the
South Pole, their intersection is called southern causal diamond.

Figure 1.15 illustrates the form of the lightcones one the de Sitter
hyperboloid. Subfigures (a), (c) and (e) on the left show the lightcones
of the AdS origin while (b), (d) and (f) one the right are plotted for
an arbitrary reference point. The spacelike regions appear in orange
again and the timelike ones in green. Again the lightcones are cut out
of the hyperboloid by a plane in embedding space containing our
reference point and being perpendicular (with respect to the metric of
embedding space) to the vector pointing from embedding space origin
towards the reference point.
In subsection 1.3.4 we will find that the form of the dS geodesics on
the hyperboloid is the the same as in AdS with only timelike and
spacelike exchanged. Thus (like AdS) de Sitter spacetime is not
geodesically convex. This can also be read off from the Penrose diagram
for @xmath and @xmath which looks like figure 1.3 rotated to the side.
Turning to the @xmath coordinates, one realizes that they do not cover
the whole hyperboloid but only the region with @xmath and @xmath which
is the southern causal diamond [ 28 ] . The northern diamond with @xmath
and @xmath can be covered by adding an overall minus sign to the
definitions of @xmath and @xmath given above. The @xmath diamond with
@xmath and @xmath can be covered by changing @xmath into @xmath and
exchanging @xmath with @xmath in the definitions of @xmath and @xmath
for the @xmath diamond. Hence we have @xmath .
A priori we can freely choose the signs of each hyperbolic sine function
and thereby the direction of time in each diamond. We fix the signs by
choosing plus for the southern diamond and requiring that crossing the
lines @xmath shall not change the direction of the time coordinate.
Moreover we remark that the static coordinates are not unique: the two
points @xmath and @xmath are mapped to the same coordinates @xmath .
Thus the dS hyperboloid covers the @xmath -space twice: southern and
eastern diamond together one time, and northern and western diamond a
second time.

Figure 1.16 shows the de Sitter hyperboloid in static coordinates. The
southern causal diamond is the stripe in strawberry red, the northern
diamond is the one in moss-green, the eastern one is painted in
tangerine and the western one in lime.

Figure 1.17 is again the Penrose diagram, this time with coordinate
lines of @xmath .
The inverted relations between coordinates in embedding space and in de
Sitter spacetime are given by:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.78)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.79)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.80)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.81)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

In deSitter spacetime there also exists a patchwise coordinate system
with a particular simple metric. These so called planar coordinates are
given by:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --
     @xmath            @xmath      
     @xmath            @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --

Our planar time variable @xmath is connected to the planar time variable
@xmath of Spradlin, Strominger and Volovich in [ 28 ] via @xmath . The
inverted relations are:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

For @xmath the mapping into embedding space coordinates is ill defined.
The patch with @xmath covers the one half of the hyperboloid with @xmath
and the patch with @xmath covers the other half @xmath .

Figure 1.18 shows the dS hyperboloid in planar coordinates. 1.18 (b)
demonstrates (again slightly exaggerated) how the @xmath - plane
separates the two patches.

Figure 1.19 is yet another Penrose diagram of de Sitter spacetime, now
for planar coordinates. The orange curves are lines of fixed @xmath and
the green ones of fixed @xmath . We notice that @xmath and @xmath
exchanged their roles with regard to AdS. For @xmath we have @xmath
within @xmath as shown in the coloured diagram, only for the hyperboloid
of dS @xmath we have @xmath within @xmath and the diagram is then
extended by the grey part on the left hand side. Thus if for the latter
case we identify the lines of @xmath and @xmath and then horizontally
roll up the diagram into a cylinder, then we obtain a flattened version
of the hyperboloid covered by planar coordinates.
In the planar coordinates there is no origin because of @xmath . We just
find that @xmath corresponds to @xmath with @xmath . In planar
coordinates we find for the antipodal point:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

##### Chordal distance

The chordal distance @xmath of two points @xmath and @xmath in deSitter
spacetime is the squared distance of their corresponding points @xmath
and @xmath on the hyperboloid in embedding space, defined again avoiding
a factor of @xmath on the right hand side:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.82)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.83)

@xmath is the antipodal chordal distance. Both chordal distances are
unique on the hyperboloid and SO @xmath -invariant.
When written without arguments, the chordal distances are meant to refer
to the arguments @xmath as above. There exist a few simple relations
between them for dS:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.84)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.85)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

#### 1.3.2 dS metrics

The squared infinitesimal length element is

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (1.86)
              @xmath      (1.87)
              @xmath      (1.88)
              @xmath      (1.89)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

wherein @xmath is the infinitesimal line element on the unit sphere
@xmath and indices in Latin lower cases are running within @xmath . For
the metric on @xmath in standard spherical coordinates one finds:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (1.90)
  -- -------- -- --------

Metric ( 1.87 ) is conformally equivalent to the complete @xmath
-dimensional Einstein static universe and thus (with the coordinate
ranges also matching) dS @xmath can be conformally mapped into the full
ESU @xmath (compare with subsection 1.2.2 ). Therefore we refer to the
global @xmath coordinates as conformal coordinates and call @xmath
conformal time variable.
The planar coordinates lead to a conformally flat metric and hence
@xmath is a conformal time variable.
Only metric ( 1.88 ) is time independent, which is the reason why we
call @xmath static coordinates. Fortunately the metric is the same for
all four diamonds. The static coordinates have the advantage that (in
contrast to the other time variables) @xmath is a Killing vector
fulfilling the Killing equation ( 1.22 ) and therefore can be used to
define time evolution and a Hamiltonian.
For the induced metric in this coordinate set we find with indices in
greek lower cases running within @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.91)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.92)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.93)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.94)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.95)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.96)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The d’Alembertian on dS then is

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (1.97)
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

and the Christoffel symbols (independent of @xmath ) read:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.98)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.99)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.100)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.101)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.102)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

The metric ( 1.86 ) of the global @xmath coordinates with ( 1.90 ) is
diagonal and using @xmath we find the d’Alembertian:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.103)
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

#### 1.3.3 Conformal dimension and mass term for dS spacetime

In [ 28 ] Spradlin, Strominger and Volovich for dS @xmath spacetime give
a relation between a parameter @xmath and the mass of our scalar field:

  -- -- -- ---------
           (1.104)
  -- -- -- ---------

This @xmath is the conformal dimension (conformal weight) of a CFT field
that via dS/CFT correspondence is related to a scalar field with mass
@xmath on dS. @xmath are the two solutions of the quadratic equation

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.105)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We see that the conformal weights are real for small masses fulfilling

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.106)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and become complex elsewise. If the mass value is equal to the negative
conformal mass value of AdS ( 1.43 ) we get the same values for the
conformal dimensions:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.107)
  -- -------- -- ---------

#### 1.3.4 Geodesics in dS spacetime

In this section we turn to finding geodesics for dS @xmath spacetime
following roughly the same road as taken in the section for the AdS
case. We begin considering an arbitrary curve @xmath with contour
parameter @xmath on the hyperboloid ( 1.74 ) in embedding space:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.108)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.109)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.110)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Since ( 1.109 ) is true for all curves passing the point @xmath on the
hyperboloid we know that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.111)
  -- -------- -- ---------

holds for all vectors @xmath in the tangent space of the point @xmath of
dS. By the usual definition a curve in embedding space is called:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.112)
     @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Likewise to AdS, we can decompose the vector @xmath into a vector @xmath
living in the tangent space @xmath and another vector @xmath which does
not live there:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.113)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Using the radial coordinates for the embedding space we have:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

The wanted curve is a geodesic running on the hyperboloid @xmath const.
and therefore @xmath is zero. We now take @xmath as an affine parameter.
The metric of the embedding space is block diagonal for all three
coordinate sets:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.114)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Hence @xmath also vanishes. Along a geodesic we know that the length of
the tangent vector is constant:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.115)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Thus for a curve in embedding space which is a geodesic in dS we have

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.116)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Moreover ( 1.115 ) also implies @xmath and therefore

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.117)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Together with ( 1.111 ) this means that @xmath must be parallel to
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.118)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Plugging ( 1.116 ) in ( 1.110 ) we find:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.119)
  -- -------- -- ---------

For timelike geodesics we have @xmath and therefore obtain:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.120)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Plugging this into ( 1.108 ) and then evaluating for @xmath we find that
the vectors @xmath and @xmath are constrained by:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

For spacelike geodesics we have @xmath and find:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.121)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Plugging into ( 1.108 ) and evaluating for @xmath we find the
constraints:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

For nullgeodesics we have @xmath which leads to @xmath . Hence lightlike
geodesics on dS are just straight lines in embedding space and via (
1.116 ) they are also lightlike geodesics in the sense of embedding
space. In contrast, timelike (spacelike) geodesics in dS remain timelike
(spacelike) but are not geodesics in embedding space.

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.122)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Plugging into ( 1.108 ) and evaluating for @xmath this time we encounter
the constraints:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Planes in embedding space spanned by two vectors @xmath and @xmath and
docked at the point @xmath are described by @xmath . Therefore all three
equations ( 1.120 ), ( 1.121 ) and ( 1.122 ) say that geodesics of dS
run in planes in embedding space which contain the origin and are
spanned by the pseudoorthogonal vectors @xmath and @xmath .
The dS geodesics are the intersection lines of these planes and the
hyperboloid. Timelike geodesics are hyperbolae in embedding space,
lightlike geodesics are lines and spacelike geodesics form ellipses.
This is just the contrary of the situation in AdS.

The geodesics of dS spacetime are drawn in figure 1.8 . The subfigures
on the left half show geodesics running through the dS origin and those
on the right half show geodesics through an arbitrary point. Orange
background indicates spacelike geodesics, green background marks the
timelike geodesics, running through the origin/arbitrary point and grey
background the timelike ones through its antipode point. The black
curves running through these points are geodesics (i.e. the closed
ellipses on orange and the hyperbolae on green/grey, while other
coloured sets of curves are auxiliary lines only). The two subfigures at
the bottom give a view ”from below” (i.e. from a point sitting in the
deep on the @xmath -axis).
Comparing the subfigures on the right half with figure 1.18 one can
recognize that the two regions of the planar coordinates are the regions
covered by the timelike geodesics through the point @xmath respectively
its antipode point. These timelike geodesics correspond to the green
curves of constant @xmath in figure 1.19 .

#### 1.3.5 Time ordering in dS

In this section we check the invariance of time ordering in dS spacetime
under the action of SO @xmath . First we consider time ordering for the
time coordinates @xmath and @xmath and take a look at the time @xmath in
the second subsection.

##### Time ordering for @xmath and @xmath

Only in this subsection indices in Latin lower cases run within (1, …,
d) while Latin upper cases cover the full range of (0, …, d). Since
@xmath is constant on the hyperboloid, both time coordinates @xmath and
@xmath only depend on the embedding space coordinate @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Both @xmath and @xmath only depend on @xmath and grow strictly
monotonic, hence the coordinate lines of @xmath and @xmath are just the
coordinate lines of @xmath . Thus in an @xmath -plane we see that a
curve @xmath on the hyperboloid in embedding space with contour
parameter @xmath is running @xmath the direction of time if @xmath .

Figure 1.21 shows the projection of a curve @xmath in dS into an @xmath
-plane. The dashed line is again perpendicular to the coordinate lines
of @xmath and @xmath in the considered point. Being a scalar @xmath
already is SO @xmath invariant and checking the invariance of @xmath
runs pretty parallel to what we did for the universal covering AdS in
subsection 1.2.5 and 1.2.5 .
It is sufficient to do this check for boosts in the (0,1)-plane since
the other (0,k)-planes are analogue and rotations in the (j,k)-planes do
not affect the time coordinates. Our boost matrix is again:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath               (1.123)
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.124)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Two points on the curve are causally connected if they can be joined by
a timelike geodesic. In contrast to AdS, in de Sitter spacetime there no
causally connected points (but spacelike separated points) which cannot
be joined by a geodesic.
Geodesics again are sections of planes (containing the embedding space
origin) with the hyperboloid and therefore lie within planes with
parameter vectors @xmath and @xmath fixed by two points connected via
the geodesic:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (1.125)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

For timelike geodesics we have @xmath and therefore

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (1.126)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Hence altogether we can compute for timelike curves:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (1.127)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

This shows that @xmath is SO @xmath invariant for timelike curves.
Therefore also we know that @xmath and @xmath are SO @xmath invariant
and can write the action of the dS time ordering operator @xmath in the
standard way:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

##### Time ordering for @xmath

Time ordering for @xmath is different to the previous cases because here
the time coordinate is composed from two embedding space coordinates
with different signs in the embedding space metric. A priori we expect
difficulties with time ordering in static coordinates because boosts or
rotations in the various planes can map points from one of the causal
diamonds into another diamond. We return to the notation that indices in
Latin lower cases run within (1, …, d-1).

Figure 1.21 shows the projection of a piece of a curve @xmath in the
southern diamond of dS into an @xmath -plane. The grey lines are
coordinate lines of @xmath . The dashed straight ones at the left are
the limits of the southern diamond, the full one at the right is the
limit of the dS hyperboloid and the dashed one between them is a
coordinate line running through the considered point. Here the notation
is @xmath . @xmath is the tangent vector of the curve in the point
@xmath and

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

is the tangent vector of the coordinate line ( @xmath constant) in the
same point. We see that the curve runs @xmath the direction of the time
@xmath in the considered point if @xmath which in static coordinates
writes as @xmath .
We can do similar investigations for the other three diamonds and always
obtain the same criterion @xmath . Thus we must check the invariance of
@xmath under SO @xmath . It is sufficient to check the cases of boosts
in the (0,1) and (0,d)-plane and the rotation in the (d-1,d)-plane since
all other cases are analog and rotations in the (j,k)-planes do affect
neither @xmath nor @xmath .
We start by giving the corresponding matrices which transform both
@xmath and @xmath . With the rapidity @xmath the matrices @xmath for a
boost in the (0,1)-plane and @xmath for the (0,d)-plane read:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.128)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.129)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

With the angle of rotation @xmath the matrix @xmath for a rotation in
the (d-1,d)-plane writes:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.130)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

We continue by confirming our preoccupation against the desired SO
@xmath -invariance via a counter-example. We consider a timelike
geodesic of the form ( 1.120 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

running through the point @xmath in embedding space. Thus we have @xmath
and with @xmath we can fulfill all three constraints @xmath and @xmath .
Using @xmath we can verify that the curve is running in the direction of
the time @xmath in the point @xmath : @xmath .
But using the matrix C given above we find that @xmath which becomes
smaller then zero for @xmath or @xmath .
Thus the rotation in the (d-1,d)-plane reverses the temporal direction
of the curve as soon as the considered point is moved into the northern
diamond. Now we could change the direction of the time arrows in figure
??? XX ??? by changing the signs of the hyperbolic sine functions in
some diamonds. But no matter how we arrange them, there will always be
some SO @xmath -boost or rotation, which does not change the direction
of the curve in embedding space yet moves it into a diamond with
opposite direction of the time @xmath .
Hence when using standard @xmath time ordering one must be aware that it
is not generally invariant under SO @xmath .

#### 1.3.6 Connection between AdS and dS spacetime

Anti de Sitter and de Sitter spacetime with the same radius @xmath are
connected in a simple way. We start with the @xmath -dimensional AdS
hyperboloid @xmath in a @xmath -dimensional embedding space with the
metric @xmath . Therefrom we obtain @xmath -dimensional de Sitter
spacetime @xmath in a @xmath -dimensional embedding space with the
metric @xmath wherein @xmath via the following coordinate transformation
in embedding space:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (1.131)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The coordinate transformation naturally leaves the scalar product in
embedding space invariant @xmath while transforming the metric @xmath
just in the right way for matching definition ( 1.74 ) of de Sitter
spacetime.
A priori the signs in the B-matrix can be chosen arbitrarily for each
entry. Choosing @xmath via the identifactions @xmath and @xmath turns
the definitions of the @xmath coordinates ( 1.7 ) exactly into those of
the @xmath coordinates ( 1.75 ) for the southern causal diamond.
However, we notice that the other diamonds and coordinate systems do not
transform that easily.

## Chapter 2 Propagators

### 2.1 Propagators for Minkowski spacetime

#### 2.1.1 General properties of the propagators

In this section the definitions and relations between different
propagators for a hermitian scalar field @xmath are reviewed for
Minkowski spacetime.
The positive/negative frequency parts of @xmath are written as @xmath
(see chapter 2.1.2 ). @xmath denotes the coordinates in spacetime with
the time coordinate @xmath . The metric used is @xmath diag @xmath .
Up to imaginary prefactors the various propagator functions according to
Birrell and Davies [ 5 ] (chapter 2.7) are defined and referred to as:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
                       @xmath   @xmath      (2.1)
     @xmath   @xmath                        (2.2)
                       @xmath   @xmath      (2.3)
              @xmath                        
                       @xmath   @xmath      (2.4)
              @xmath                        
                       @xmath   @xmath      (2.5)
                       @xmath   @xmath      (2.6)
                       @xmath   @xmath      (2.7)
              @xmath                        (2.8)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The Wightman function @xmath propagates the positive and @xmath the
negative frequencies of the field @xmath . @xmath is the Dyson time
ordering operator and sorts earlier operators rightwards.
Taking into consideration that the propagator is supposed to be
invariant under translations the argument @xmath becomes @xmath and
@xmath becomes @xmath .
Defined as above the propagators are connected by the following
relations:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.9)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.10)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.11)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.12)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.13)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.14)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.15)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.16)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.17)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.18)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.19)
              @xmath      (2.20)
              @xmath      (2.21)
              @xmath      (2.22)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.23)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

With @xmath fulfilling the Klein-Gordon equation as equation of motion
the Wightman functions @xmath by definition are homogeneous solutions:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.24)
              @xmath      (2.25)
              @xmath      (2.26)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Then with ( 2.19 ) and ( 2.20 ) we have

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.27)
  -- -- -- --------

and from ( 2.8 ) using @xmath and the equal time commutation relation
@xmath (see also appendix B.1 ) we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 2.1.2 The method of Fourier transformation

Conventionally in four dimensional Minkowski spacetime Fourier
transformation is used in order to express fields and propagators.
We can use the definitions on pages 21-26 in Peskin, Schroeder [ 25 ]
for the field @xmath and its conjugated impulse field @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
              @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.29)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.30)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The integral over the annihilator/creator term is the positive/negative
frequency part of @xmath . The algebra of the creation operators @xmath
and the annihilation operators @xmath is

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.31)
              @xmath      (2.32)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

which realizes the equal time commutation relations

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.33)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.34)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

which in turn from ( 2.28 ) generate one delta source term in the
Klein-Gordon equation for the Feynman propagator:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

Evaluating the Wightman functions yields

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

from which the other propagators can be assembled according to their
definitions given above. Considering the integral @xmath in the complex
@xmath -plane

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.37)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

we find two poles at @xmath . The propagators then correspond to the
different contours of integration shown in figures 2.1 , 2.2 and 2.3
which are ajusted for our conventions from Birrell and Davies [ 5 ]
(Fig. 3 in chapter 2.7).

The contours of @xmath , @xmath and @xmath can be closed
counterclockwise above the real @xmath -axis for @xmath and clockwise
below for @xmath picking up the encircled poles according to Cauchy’s
integral formula for holomorphic functions:

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.38)
  -- -- -- --------

In order to be able to perform the integration exactly on the real
@xmath -axis we have to shift or rotate the poles. We remember that
@xmath is infinitesimally small so that @xmath times any positive
quantity is just @xmath . For the retarded Green function the shift is
@xmath and for the advanced Green function @xmath . The shifted poles
and contours are shown in figures 2.4 and 2.5 . We obtain:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

For the Feynman propagator the clockwise rotation is @xmath . The
rotated poles and contour are shown in figure 2.6 and we obtain:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.39)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

This example shows how the explicit method ( 2.8 ) of time ordering in
Minkowski spacetime leads to the @xmath -prescription ( 2.39 ) in the
construction of the Feynman propagator.

#### 2.1.3 The DvB method in Minkowski spacetime

In [ 18 ] C. Dullemond and E. van Beveren develop a configuration space
method for finding the various propagators and apply it to four
dimensional Minkowski and AdS @xmath spacetime. The advantage of their
method is that it delivers in one go all propagator functions including
@xmath -prescriptions without needing to perform a mode summation as
done by Burgess and Lutken in [ 12 ] for AdS and by Bousso, Maloney and
Strominger in [ 8 ] for de Sitter spacetime. Analytic continuation from
euclidean time obtained via Wick rotation is not needed as well.
The following sections are devoted to first understanding their method
and then generalizing it to AdS spaces of arbitrary dimension @xmath .
The notation used here is connected to the one used by Dullemond and van
Beveren (DvB) by the prefactors

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

In order to become familiar with the DvB method we begin by considering
it in Minkowski spacetime with @xmath denoting a four vector and the
metric still being @xmath .
The general strategy of Dullemond and van Beveren consists of first
finding a candidate function @xmath that is a solution of the
homogeneous Klein-Gordon equation. ¹ ¹ 1 We must not mix up the scalar
field @xmath with the candidate function @xmath . The field is always
recognizable by one single latin lower case in the argument, the
function by one greek lower case or multiple arguments. The second step
is modifying it purposively in order to later identify the modified
offspring versions with the various propagators ( 2.1 )-( 2.7 ).
First we need to find a solution @xmath of the homogeneous Klein-Gordon
equation that drops off to zero at infinite distance @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.40)
     @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

The factor @xmath is introduced in order to take into account the mass
@xmath of our scalar field later. In general @xmath shall provide a
measure for the distance of the two points @xmath and @xmath , which is
invariant under the symmetry transformations of the considered
spacetime. When @xmath is written without arguments then it always
denotes @xmath .
On the light cone @xmath this solution in general will turn out to be
ill defined, thus we apply one of the following two complex shifts in
the time coordinate:

  -- -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
        @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.41)
        @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.42)
  -- -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

In Minkowski spacetime both shifts are equivalent and do not change the
d’Alem- bertian while shifting @xmath and thereby

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

This shift will render @xmath well defined for all real values of the
argument. In the limit of small @xmath this definition of @xmath will
also render the solutions @xmath invariant under orthochronous Lorentz
transformations, i.e. those that do not change the direction of time
i.e. the sign of @xmath . Now we dispose of two solutions of the
homogenous Klein-Gordon equation:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.43)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

We intend to soon identify @xmath with @xmath and notice that the
therefor required relation ( 2.10 ) @xmath is already fulfilled via the
definition of @xmath . The second necessary relation ( 2.11 ) @xmath is
also accomplished because of @xmath .
In order to bestow a spatial delta function upon equation ( 2.28 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and thereby turning it into ( 2.35 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we additionally require @xmath to satisfy

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath being a normalization constant. Then we can enact the
following identifications fulfilling equations ( 2.3 - 2.23 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.45)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.46)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.47)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.48)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.49)
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.50)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

In the Feynman propagator the time ordering leads to an i @xmath -term
which is zero for @xmath and positive otherwise, this time in
configuration space. Due to our way of construction we find that the
Feynman propagator is indeed a solution of the inhomogeneous
Klein-Gordon equation:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.51)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

##### Generalized version

In order to apply the DvB method to spacetimes with nonvanishing
constant curvature we need to generalize it a bit. As a generalized
version of ( 2.44 ) we will encounter in @xmath -dimensional constantly
curved spacetime

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.52)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

with some function @xmath . As a generalization of ( 2.28 ) we will meet
(see appendix B.1 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.53)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

with the sign @xmath introduced in chapter 1 . Therefore in order to
fulfill the generalized version of the inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon
equation ( 2.51 )

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.54)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

we have to perform a modified version of the identification ( 2.45 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.55)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

For the invariance of the propagators under the SO @xmath symmetry group
of the considered spacetime it is therein necessary that @xmath and
@xmath are constants. @xmath must either be constant or fit properly
into the integral of normalization as we will find in subsection 2.3.3
for de Sitter spacetime.

##### Massless scalar field in Minkowski spacetime

In order to get used to this method, we first employ it in four
dimensional Minkowski spacetime. We start with the massless case @xmath
and choose @xmath . Our homogeneous solution of the massless
Klein-Gordon equation is:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

On page 649 in Bogoliubov, Shirkov [ 6 ] we find:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.56)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.57)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

We see the required properties ( 2.10 ) and ( 2.11 ) fullfilled.
Moreover we have

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

wherein we have used equation 56 on page 157 in Bronstein [ 11 ] :

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Hence with

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we have reproduced property ( 2.44 ) with @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Inserting everything in relations ( 2.45 )-( 2.50 ) we arrive for the
massless case at

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.58)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.59)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.60)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.61)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.62)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.63)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

From ( 2.51 ) we know that @xmath which is confirmed by ( A.17 ). We
notice that the propagators show singularities on the whole lightcone
yet only generate one single delta source in the inhomogeneous
Klein-Gordon equation.

##### Massive scalar field in Minkowski spacetime

In the massive case @xmath finding the solution @xmath is a little bit
more difficult. We choose @xmath and the shift @xmath leads to @xmath .
In terms of @xmath the Klein-Gordon equation reads

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

We define @xmath for @xmath and @xmath for @xmath . Considering positive
@xmath equation ( 2.64 ) turns into

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

This is the Bessel equation with index 1. (eq. 9.1.1 on p. 358 in
Abramowitz, Stegun [ 2 ] ) So if @xmath is a solution of this Bessel
equation, then @xmath is a solution of the Klein-Gordon equation for
positive @xmath .
With negative @xmath equation ( 2.64 ) becomes

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

This is the modified Bessel equation with index 1 (eq. 9.6.1, p.374,
Abramowitz, Stegun [ 2 ] ). So if @xmath is a solution of this modified
Bessel equation, then @xmath is a solution of the Klein-Gordon equation
for negative @xmath .
The solution that falls off to zero for @xmath is @xmath . @xmath is the
modified Hankel function with index 1 and @xmath are the Hankel
functions of first and second kind with index 1. With @xmath (eq. 9.6.4,
p.375, Abramowitz, Stegun [ 2 ] ) and @xmath this leads to

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

derived here for negative @xmath . With the Hankel functions being
solutions of the Bessel equation this expression is also valid for
positive @xmath . Using equations 9.1.3,4,11 in Abramowitz, Stegun [ 2 ]
we can write equation ( 2.65 ) as

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.66)
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.67)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

wherein @xmath is a real function given in equation 9.1.11 in
Abramowitz, Stegun [ 2 ] . When taking the derivative, only the
contribution of the pole term survives. Likewise to the massless case we
thereby reproduce property ( 2.44 ):

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Applying again relations ( 2.45 )-( 2.50 ) in the massive case we find:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.68)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.69)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.70)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.71)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.72)
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.73)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

These results found by Dullemond and van Beveren are in agreement with
those listed in appendix I.B p.649 in Bogoliubov, Shirkov [ 6 ] .
From ( 2.51 ) we know again that @xmath . As in the massless case the
propagators exhibit singularities on the whole lightcone @xmath but only
lead to one single delta source at the coincident point @xmath .
We finally note that in Minkowski spacetime the @xmath -term is always
time independent, a property that is subject to change in AdS spacetime.

### 2.2 Propagators for AdS spacetime

#### 2.2.1 General properties of propagators in AdS

In this section we turn to investigate propagators in AdS, still on the
traces of Dullemond and van Beveren [ 18 ] .
The definitions and relations between the different propagators for
hermitian scalar fields @xmath in AdS are the same as in Minkowski
spacetime ( 2.1 - 2.23 ). Now @xmath is a point in AdS with @xmath
serving as time coordinate.

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
                       @xmath   @xmath      (2.74)
     @xmath   @xmath                        (2.75)
                       @xmath   @xmath      (2.76)
              @xmath                        
                       @xmath   @xmath      (2.77)
              @xmath                        
                       @xmath   @xmath      (2.78)
                       @xmath   @xmath      (2.79)
                       @xmath   @xmath      (2.80)
              @xmath                        (2.81)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

@xmath is the time ordering operator for the universal covering space
(see subsection 1.2.5 ). We will briefly comment the case of the
hyperboloid in a subsection further below.
Defined this way, the propagator functions again are connected by the
relations:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.82)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.83)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.84)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.85)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.86)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.87)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.88)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.89)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.90)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.91)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.92)
              @xmath      (2.93)
              @xmath      (2.94)
              @xmath      (2.95)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.96)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Now referring back to to the overall sign @xmath of the embedding
space’s metric introduced in equation ( 1.3 ), we note that the
Klein-Gordon operator on AdS reads @xmath .
Our field @xmath again fulfills the Klein-Gordon equation as its
equation of motion. So the Wightman functions @xmath by definition are
homogeneous solutions:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.97)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.98)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.99)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Then with ( 2.92 ) and ( 2.93 ) we have again

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.100)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Starting from the definition ( 2.81 ) of the Feynman propagator and
using equation ( 1.29 )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.101)
  -- -------- -- ---------

together with the equal time commutation relation @xmath we obtain (see
appendix B.1 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.102)
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

This expression already delivers a delta function for the time variables
of the spacetime points @xmath and @xmath .
Defining the various propagators as in equations ( 2.74 )-( 2.81 )
corresponds to define as Feynman propagator the function fulfilling the
inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.103)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.104)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

This definition is consistent with [ 15 , 17 , 18 ] , because in
continuation @xmath to Euclidean space the factor @xmath in front of the
delta source becomes @xmath .

##### Solving the inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation

Once found, we can use retarded, advanced and Feynman propagator for
finding the solution @xmath of the inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation
for any given source @xmath on the right hand side. Letting the inverse
Klein-Gordon operator act from the left on ( 2.103 ) we obtain:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

This equation shows to be very useful in the following calculation

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.105)
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.106)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

wherein @xmath is a solution of the free (homogeneous) Klein-Gordon
equation.

#### 2.2.2 From Klein-Gordon to the hypergeometric equation

Because of the designated SO @xmath invariance (up to time ordering
subtleties) of the propagators it is clear that our candidate function
can depend only on the chordal distance: @xmath .

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

We make the following ansatz

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.107)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and will utilize it soon. But for the moment we need to turn to finding
a relation between the d’Alembertians in embedding space and AdS. We
denote with @xmath the coordinates on AdS. Setting @xmath , which is
realized by all given coordinate sets, we get @xmath therefrom @xmath
and further on

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

So the hyperbolical form @xmath of the metric in the embedding space is:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

@xmath is the induced metric on a hyperboloid with @xmath and therefore
the metric of an AdS space. Defining

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we have @xmath . We find for the d’Alembertians @xmath in the embedding
space and @xmath on the hyperbolic hypersurfaces with constant @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.108)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Introducing the generalized angular momentum operators

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the generalized squared total angular momentum operator

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

we find:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.109)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Comparing ( 2.108 ) and ( 2.109 ) shows the equivalence of the squared
angular momentum operator and the d’Alembertian on the hyperboloid:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.110)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We will derive our candidate function @xmath which lives on AdS from a
function @xmath which lives in embedding space. Because of SO @xmath
invariance @xmath can only depend on @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and a
distance winding number @xmath . We make the following separation ansatz
introducing a new parameter @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.111)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This parameter @xmath is @xmath in the notation of Dullemond and van
Beveren: @xmath . Using ( 2.109 ) we find with @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.112)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Moreover we have:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.113)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

So being a solution of equation ( 2.2.2 ) and obeying the homogeneous
Klein-Gordon equation ( 2.2.2 ) in AdS @xmath with the squared mass
@xmath is equivalent for @xmath . This mass term exactly matches
relation ( 1.35 ).
Equation ( 2.2.2 ) is of the hypergeometric type defined on p. 562 in
Abramowitz, Stegun [ 2 ] as:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.114)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In our case the parameters are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.115)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The regular solution of the hypergeometric differential equation is the
hypergeometric function @xmath . Some useful properties of this
hypergeometric function are listed in appendix A.2 . In particular
@xmath is is symmetric under the exchange of @xmath and @xmath i.e.
under @xmath i.e. under @xmath (see section 1.2.3 ). We have found a
first candidate function:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.116)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This function is regular at @xmath because Re @xmath .

In figure 2.7 the function is plotted for @xmath with the conformal
values ( 1.43 ) of @xmath . Looking at ( 2.114 ) we find that
substituting @xmath yields the same differential equation with the same
parameters @xmath and @xmath . Therefore we have found a second
candidate function:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.117)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This function is divergent in @xmath for @xmath because Re @xmath . In
figure 2.8 the function is plotted with the same parameters as in the
plot above.

#### 2.2.3 Inspection of the candidate functions

What we are looking for is a function that converges to zero if the
chordal distance @xmath goes to (positive or negative) infinity. When
working with hypergeometric functions we have two standard quantities
going to zero for large chordal distances:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Dullemond and van Beveren work with @xmath in [ 18 ] . @xmath is the
quantity used by Burgess and Lutken in their calculation of the Feynman
propagator via a mode summation [ 12 ] ( @xmath therein is denoted as
@xmath ). Their result is cited often e.g. [ 15 ] wherein the euclidean
version of the propagator is given ( and @xmath is denoted as @xmath ).
Using these two quantities we can split up our solution in two different
ways according to equations ( A.30 ) and ( A.31 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
                          (2.118)
              @xmath      
                          (2.119)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

However using equations ( A.28 ) and ( A.29 ) we see that the first
summand in ( 2.118 ) is equal to the first summand of ( 2.119 ) and that
the second summands also match. In the following calculations we will
make use of ( 2.118 ).
Each of the two summands in ( 2.118 ) is a solution of the
hypergeometric differential equation (see [ 2 ] 15.5.A). Hence in both
cases we can chose either part of ( 2.118 ) as a solution of ( 2.2.2 )
and consider them separately, the prefactors with the four Gamma
functions dropped:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.120)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.121)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

These two functions satisfy the homogeneous Klein-Gordon equation on AdS
and therefore are candidates for the construction of our various
propagators. In figure 2.9 the function @xmath is plotted with the same
parameters as in the plots before.

If we perform such a splitting using ( A.31 ) with the second candidate
function @xmath end resubstitute @xmath by @xmath we end up with the
same two functions ( 2.120 ) and ( 2.121 ). Solely the fractions in
front of @xmath become @xmath . Hence by factoring out @xmath we obtain
exactly the same functions. This factor later would be devoured by the
normalization, thus we do not need to consider this case further.
With the conditions ( 1.41 ) and ( 1.42 ) by Breitenlohner and Freedman
and using @xmath for @xmath we find that the propagator must vanish for
large @xmath faster than

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for the regular definition of the energy functional respectively faster
than

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

for its improved version. Thus we find for the regular energy definition
that @xmath is allowed for @xmath which is fulfilled by @xmath only.
@xmath is admitted for @xmath which is fulfilled by @xmath only. This is
the reason why we have to treat @xmath and @xmath separately and cannot
use the original candidate function which is (up to the dropped @xmath
-functions) the sum of both.
For the improved energy definition @xmath is allowed for @xmath which
always is fulfilled by @xmath but also by @xmath if

  -- -- -- ---------
           (2.122)
  -- -- -- ---------

@xmath is then permitted for @xmath which is always fulfilled by @xmath
and also by @xmath if the same mass condition as above is satisfied. We
will not consider this case in detail here.
We just note that since both candidate functions are allowed for the
satisfied mass condition, also both propagators soon constructed from
them will be allowed. Thus adjusting their normalization with the
dropped @xmath -functions one could use the entire unsplitted candidate
function as propagator. So far we have found:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.123)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.124)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

We can check that @xmath . Hence we can always switch from @xmath to
@xmath by replacing @xmath . Therefore in the following we will only
study the case of @xmath .
Now we must have a closer look on @xmath . Evaluating ansatz ( 2.107 )
for AdS we find

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.125)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and obtain for the @xmath coordinate set:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.126)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

For the origin @xmath as reference point this reduces to:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

We see that for certain values of @xmath our invariant quantity @xmath
becomes zero which is pathological because @xmath is singular in @xmath
.

##### Infinitesimal shift in complex time plane

In order to remove this flaw we apply again a shift in the complex time
plane

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which results in complex coordinates @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.127)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We can check that @xmath , @xmath and therefore @xmath . Altogether the
complex time shift results in a complex rotation in the @xmath plane
generated by the generalized angular momentum operator @xmath which
commutes with @xmath , @xmath and @xmath [ 18 ] . In the limit of small
@xmath we find:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

We leave @xmath and thereby @xmath unchanged. Next we define

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.128)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.129)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.130)
     @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

@xmath is SO @xmath invariant and sign @xmath sign @xmath is invariant
under orthochronous SO @xmath . For small @xmath this definition of
@xmath yields

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.131)
              @xmath      (2.132)
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.133)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

so that again we have @xmath .

Figure 2.10 shows the time dependence of @xmath in the complex plane. It
is plotted with purpose of illustration only for the convenient values
@xmath , @xmath and @xmath .
The graph starts at the larger triangle pointing downwards at the very
left hand side where @xmath . It continues counterclockwise with @xmath
at the smaller triangles. @xmath starts at the same triangle as @xmath
but always moves in clockwise direction. In the limit of small @xmath
the triangles for @xmath move close to the real axis.
We see @xmath running on one smaller and one larger ellipse by turns and
having a period of @xmath in @xmath . The points @xmath and @xmath are
always enclosed and never crossed for finite @xmath . Therefore we
obtain the well defined function

  -- -------- -- -- ---------
     @xmath         (2.134)
  -- -------- -- -- ---------

##### Distance winding number

Now we define a distance winding number @xmath in the following SO
@xmath -invariant way:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.135)
     @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Whenever @xmath changes sign then @xmath is just passing the point 1 in
the complex plane. In general the distance winding number @xmath depends
not only on the difference of the times but also on the @xmath and
@xmath coordinates. When below @xmath is written without arguments then
it is always to be understood as @xmath .
Only for @xmath and therefore also for the special reference point
@xmath both ellipses coincide (which changes the period of @xmath to
@xmath ). For this case our definition of @xmath yields the simpler
expression:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.136)
  -- -------- -- ---------

But we will consider the general case. We first note that in the limit
of small @xmath the ellipses move infinitesimally close to the real axis
(with the critical points 0 and 1 still being encircled). Thereby the
phases @xmath of @xmath become integer multiples of @xmath .
When @xmath is changed with constant @xmath and @xmath then @xmath moves
on the ellipses and sooner or later returns to its starting point.
Thereby it picks up a change in distance winding number and in phase:
@xmath .
Our function @xmath then also undergoes a change of phase which is
independent of the contour as long as it is deformed continuously
without passing the critical points @xmath . For the case of large
@xmath we can read off from equation ( 2.134 ):

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Therefrom we obtain the following additional relation:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.137)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

##### Delta source and normalization

In order to construct the Feynman propagator fulfilling the
inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation ( 2.104 ), we now want to show that
applying the Klein-Gordon operator to our candidate functions yields the
desired delta source.
According to ( 2.102 ) we therefor need to examine @xmath with the
intention of showing that it delivers a delta function for the spatial
variables of the spacetime points @xmath and @xmath .
Starting from equation ( 2.134 ) and employing ( A.30 ) we get

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Next we put to work the chain rule of differentiation @xmath wherein for
the last factor we can make use of equation ( A.26 ).

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.138)
              @xmath      
                          
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

From equation ( 2.132 ) we can read off that for small @xmath we have

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.139)
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.140)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

which for our special reference point @xmath reduces to the simple
expression

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.141)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

We note that @xmath and is equal to @xmath if and only if @xmath . This
special feature renders @xmath negative and thus nonzero for all @xmath
. This in turn signifies that indeed we can let our @xmath run to zero
whenever @xmath so that @xmath vanishes for this case.
In order to determine suitable normalisation constants we need to
integrate @xmath over @xmath dimensional @xmath -space. Doing so, we
find that the first two summands in equation ( 2.138 ) yield
contributions proportional to @xmath respectively @xmath which therefore
vanish in the limit of small @xmath .
When turning to the third summand, we first compute the @xmath -space
integral over @xmath for the case of our reference point @xmath and find
using integral ( A.20 )

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.142)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.143)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Looking at ( 2.139 ) we see that for @xmath we have @xmath and therefore
arrive at the desired spatial delta function:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.144)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

With this relation fixed we can now identify following section 2.1.3 :

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.145)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.146)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

and construct the other propagators according to ( 2.76 - 2.81 ). Now we
can step back and evaluate equation ( 2.102 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.147)
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.148)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

We see that the Feynman propagator fulfills just the inhomogeneous
Klein-Gordon equation ( 2.104 ) with one delta source on its right hand
side:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

After a little cleanup the normalization constants condense to:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.149)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.150)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Of course we do not want the @xmath functions in our normalization
constants to run to infinity. One could expect this requirement to lead
to restrictions on @xmath , but these are already fulfilled by the range
of validity assigned to the candidate functions with labels (a) and (b)
in the discussion below equation ( 2.121 ) or equivalently by the range
of values naturally assigned to @xmath by their definition.

##### Comment on the AdS case of the hyperboloid

As we can see in appendix B.1 , for the case of the hyperboloid instead
of equation ( 2.102 ) we obtain ( B.4 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.151)
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

The @xmath term behaves exactly as in the universal covering case and
leads to the delta source at the coincident point @xmath .
Turning to the @xmath terms we regard equation ( 2.132 ). We recognize
that with @xmath we need to insert @xmath instead of @xmath in order to
obtain the same @xmath and @xmath which we had for @xmath and which
together generated the spatial delta function as shown in the previous
subsection. Therefore both terms generate a delta source at the
antipodal point @xmath and instead of ( 2.147 ) we obtain:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.152)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

The delta source at the antipodal point is a direct consequence of the
unphysical closed timelike curves and the thereby induced time ordering
prescription.
Unfortunately because of ( 2.152 ) we cannot use the Feynman propagator
on the hyperboloid in order to solve the inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon
equation in the way shown in subsection 2.2.1 .

#### 2.2.4 Listings of the propagators

##### Propagators in @xmath - form

Below we list the various propagators for AdS @xmath in the @xmath form.
Herein @xmath is meant as in ( 2.132 ) carrying its full phase (acquired
via its position in the complex plane and the distance winding number
@xmath ) as discussed around equation ( 2.135 ). Likewise to the
candidate functions, we can obtain the @xmath propagators from the
@xmath propagators via the replacement @xmath .
Having used the method of Dullemond and van Beveren, our results
naturally agree with theirs for the case of @xmath which was studied by
them.

  -- -------- -- -- ---------
     @xmath         (2.153)
     @xmath         (2.154)
  -- -------- -- -- ---------

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.155)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.156)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.157)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.158)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.159)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.160)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Therein @xmath (with index F for Feynman) is defined for the limit of
small @xmath as

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.161)
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

so that the Feynman propagator is indeed symmetric: @xmath . The
absolute values in the argument of the sine arise in the course of the
calculation as in equation ( 2.50 ).
We observe that the @xmath -term in the Feynman propagator in AdS
spacetime is no longer time independent as it was the case in Minkowski
spacetime.

Figure 2.11 shows the sign of the @xmath -term for @xmath on the left
and for @xmath on the right hand side in a Penrose diagram of universal
covering AdS for an arbitrary reference point. The green lightcones of
points which are mapped to the black reference point via ( 1.7 ) have
@xmath while the red lightcones of points which are mapped to its
antipodal point have @xmath . Orange wedges are regions with a positive
product @xmath and white ones with negative @xmath .
We observe that for @xmath which is used in the Wightman functions
(homogeneous propagators) the sign of the @xmath -term is changing in
each of such points. Applying the Klein-Gordon operator @xmath to these
functions yields zero and thus no delta source is generated.
In contrast for @xmath used in the Feynman propagator the sign of the
@xmath -term is not changing in the coincident point. This effect is
caused by the step functions of time ordering. Letting the Klein-Gordon
operator act on the Feynman propagator generates a delta source at the
coincident point.
Figure 2.11 clarifies that on each single lightcone the sign of the
@xmath -term depends only on @xmath and in this sense is time dependent
only. If however we consider points at a fixed time @xmath then the sign
of the @xmath -term changes when moving in space from one lightcone to
another one. The sign of the @xmath -term then is determined by both
@xmath and @xmath and in this sense is also position depending. For
further remarks we repeat the definition of @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For the propagators above the hypergeometric function is defined by its
convergent Taylor series for all @xmath with @xmath . The form of the
propagators for @xmath can be obtained therefrom using ( A.30 ).
All hypergeometric functions @xmath involved also converge for @xmath
because Re @xmath .
However in all cases @xmath for @xmath and @xmath there appears the term
@xmath to positive powers only. In the limit of small @xmath this causes
the propagators to become infinitely large whenever it occurs that
@xmath . For constant @xmath this happens periodically in @xmath . As we
will see later, this happens every time the point @xmath is situated on
the lightcones of certain points @xmath . There are no conspicuities
when @xmath or @xmath .
From ( 2.137 ) we can extract the additional relations:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.162)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.163)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

##### Propagators in @xmath - form

Now it is time to remember that long long ago we had found two
equivalent ways of splitting up our one candidate function using either
@xmath or @xmath . Therefore an equivalent form of writing the
propagator functions exists. Using the variable @xmath the propagators
for AdS @xmath read:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.164)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.165)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.166)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.167)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.168)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.169)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.170)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.171)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Again we obtain the @xmath propagators from the @xmath propagators
through the replacement @xmath .
In the @xmath -form the hypergeometric functions are of the type @xmath
and thus for even AdS-dimension @xmath can be chopped up using (15.3.12)
on page 560 in Abramowitz, Stegun [ 2 ] as it is done by Dullemond and
van Beveren in [ 18 ] . For the Feynman propagator we have used

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

For the propagators above the hypergeometric function is defined by its
convergent Taylor series for all @xmath with @xmath . The form of the
propagators for @xmath can be obtained again using ( A.30 ). For further
remarks we remember the definition of @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For @xmath we find that @xmath appears in positive power which implies
that then @xmath has negative power. Hence there is no problem when
@xmath because the propagators simply vanish.
On the other hand in the form for @xmath @xmath has negative power and
therefore @xmath appears with positive power. Thus whenever @xmath then
the propagators vanish in the limit of small @xmath even though the
chordal distance can be finite.
All hypergeometric functions @xmath involved in the @xmath forms for
@xmath diverge for @xmath because we have Re @xmath .
The Feynman propagator ( 2.170 ) is in agreement with the one found by
Burgess and Lutken in [ 12 ] that is also cited by d’Hoker and Freedman
in [ 15 ] (wherein our @xmath is denoted as @xmath ). Finally we give a
plot of the unnormalized Feynman propagator in @xmath -form for the same
parameters as for figure 2.7 .

##### Singularities of the propagators

We conclude with a remark concerning antipodal points. Using equations (
1.16 ) and ( 1.17 ) we can write @xmath and @xmath using both chordal
and antipodal chordal distance:

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.172)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.173)
     @xmath   @xmath                        
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

We recognize that likewise to Minkowski spacetime the propagators are
singular on the whole lightcone @xmath of the reference point @xmath and
in addition also on the lightcone @xmath of the antipodal point @xmath .
Moreover this periodically happens on the lightcones @xmath of all
points @xmath satisfying either @xmath or @xmath when wrapping the
universal covering AdS again and again around the hyperboloid. On all
these lightcones we have @xmath and @xmath .
However, as we had already seen above and also likewise to Minkowski
spacetime, this solely generates one single delta source sitting at the
coincidence point @xmath when letting the Klein-Gordon operator act on
the Feynman propagator. This is due to the standard time ordering via
@xmath on the universal covering AdS.

### 2.3 Propagators for dS spacetime

#### 2.3.1 General properties of propagators in dS

In this section we apply the method of Dullemond and van Beveren to
deSitter spacetime. The definitions and relations between the different
propagators for hermitian scalar fields @xmath in dS are the same as the
ones listed for AdS in section 2.2.1 . Here @xmath is a point in dS in
global coordinates with @xmath serving as time coordinate. With the
overall sign @xmath of the embedding space’s metric introduced in
equation ( 1.71 ), the Klein-Gordon operator on dS reads @xmath .
Because our field @xmath again fulfills the Klein-Gordon equation, we
have

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.174)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.175)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.176)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

and

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.177)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Starting from the definition ( 2.81 ) of the Feynman propagator and
using equation ( 1.103 )

  -- -- -- ---------
           (2.178)
  -- -- -- ---------

in combination with the equal time commutation relation @xmath we obtain
(see appendix B.1 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.179)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

This expression contributes a delta function for the time variables of
the spacetime points @xmath and @xmath . (Thus the function @xmath
respectively @xmath introduced in subsection 2.1.3 is identically one
for the global coordinates.)
Defining the various propagators as in equations ( 2.74 )-( 2.81 )
corresponds to define as Feynman propagator the function fulfilling the
inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.180)
     @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

#### 2.3.2 From Klein-Gordon to the hypergeometric equation

Because of the designated SO @xmath invariance (up to time ordering
subtleties) of the propagators it is clear that our candidate function
again can depend only on the chordal distance: @xmath .

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

We make the following ansatz

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.181)
  -- -------- -- ---------

and will utilize it shortly. For the moment we need to turn to finding a
relation between the d’Alembertians in embedding space and dS. We denote
with @xmath the coordinates on dS. Setting @xmath , which is realized by
all given coordinate sets, we get @xmath therefrom @xmath and further on

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

The metric in the embedding space using radial coordinates reads:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

@xmath is the induced metric on a hyperboloid with @xmath and therefore
the metric of a deSitter space. Defining

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we have @xmath . We find for the d’Alembertians @xmath in the embedding
space and @xmath on the hyperbolic hypersurfaces with constant @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.182)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Introducing the generalized angular momentum operators

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and the generalized squared total angular momentum operator

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

we find:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.183)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Comparing ( 2.182 ) and ( 2.183 ) shows the equivalence of the squared
angular momentum operator and the d’Alembertian on the hyperboloid:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.184)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We will derive our candidate function @xmath which lives on dS from a
function @xmath which lives in embedding space. Because of SO @xmath
invariance @xmath can only depend on @xmath , @xmath , @xmath . We make
the following separation ansatz introducing a new parameter @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.185)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using ( 2.183 ) we find with @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.186)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Moreover we have:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.187)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

So being a solution of equation ( 2.3.2 ) and obeying the homogeneous
Klein-Gordon equation ( 2.3.2 ) in dS @xmath with the squared mass
@xmath is equivalent for @xmath . This mass term exactly matches
relation ( 1.105 ).
Equation ( 2.3.2 ) is of the hypergeometric type:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.188)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In our case the parameters are

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.189)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The regular solution of the hypergeometric differential equation is the
hypergeometric function @xmath . Again @xmath is symmetric under the
exchange of @xmath and @xmath i.e. under @xmath i.e. under @xmath (see
section 1.3.3 ).
We have found a first candidate function:

  -- -- -- ---------
           (2.190)
  -- -- -- ---------

In figure 2.13 this function is plotted for @xmath and the values (
1.107 ) of @xmath .

Looking at ( 2.188 ) we find that substituting @xmath yields the same
differential equation with the same parameters @xmath . Therefore we
have found a second candidate function

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.191)
  -- -------- -- ---------

with

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.192)
     @xmath      (2.193)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We note that @xmath is regular in @xmath but for @xmath is divergent in
@xmath because Re @xmath .

#### 2.3.3 Inspection of the candidate functions

What we are looking for is a function that converges to zero if the
chordal distance @xmath goes to (positive or negative) infinity. We have
the following quantities going to zero for large chordal distances:

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The following discussion is done for @xmath only, but is the same for
@xmath . Likewise to the AdS case we can split up our solution according
to equation ( A.30 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
                          (2.194)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Each of the two summands in ( 2.118 ) is a solution of the
hypergeometric differential equation (see [ 2 ] 15.5.A). In the AdS case
we took each summand as a self-contained candidate function because
Breitenlohner and Freedman found the condition that the propagator has
to vanish faster than @xmath for large @xmath . This could not be
satisfied by both summands for the same @xmath .
For the dS case the corresponding condition would be that the propagator
would have to vanish faster than @xmath for large @xmath . However no
such condition is known.
For @xmath the conformal weights @xmath are complex with positive real
part. Therefore both summands converge to zero for large @xmath . In the
case of @xmath we find @xmath and therefore both summands in ( 2.194 )
again converge to zero for large @xmath . However for @xmath it happens
that while still @xmath we now face @xmath and hence the second summand
remains nonzero or even grows for large @xmath . In this case, which we
will not consider in detail here, one can only use the first summand as
a candidate function.
Thus for @xmath we do not need to split up our solution and can continue
working with the full candidate functions.
Now we have a closer look on @xmath . Evaluating ansatz ( 2.107 ) for dS
we find:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.195)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.196)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

For the @xmath coordinate set we obtain:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.197)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

For the origin @xmath as reference point this expression condenses into:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.198)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

We see that for certain values of @xmath our invariant quantities @xmath
can become one which is pathologic because @xmath is divergent in @xmath
.

##### Infinitesimal shift in complex time plane

In order to remove this we apply again shifts in the complex @xmath
-plane

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.199)
     @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

which do not change the d’Alembertian. Now based on ( 2.195 ) there are
two possibilities of defining @xmath :

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.200)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.201)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

A priori it is not clear which version we should choose. We will use
definition @xmath and call it @xmath from here on, simply because it
yields the same results as given in [ 28 ] . We just note that using
definition @xmath yields the same signs for the terms involving @xmath
and @xmath , however instead of @xmath in ( 2.216 ) one obtains a
different constant of normalization: @xmath . Definition @xmath yields:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.202)
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

so that we have again @xmath . @xmath is SO @xmath invariant and sign
@xmath is invariant under orthochronous SO @xmath just as in Minkowski
spacetime. Moreover in the limit of small @xmath we can replace @xmath
by @xmath (see subsection 1.3.5 ).
While the @xmath term is present, the point 1 is always evaded. We
observe that the @xmath term vanishes only iff @xmath i.e. iff @xmath .
In this case we have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and thus

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.203)
     @xmath      (2.204)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We see that in the upper line @xmath is always separated from 1 by
@xmath while in the lower line @xmath crosses 1. Thereby it is clear
that @xmath is the right quantity for @xmath and @xmath is the right one
for @xmath . This assignment is confirmed by the observation that for
vanishing chordal distance @xmath we obtain @xmath which lets the
candidate functions become singular exactly on the lightcone of the
coincident point @xmath in embedding space i.e. @xmath in dS. The
opposite assignment would let them become singular on the lightcone of
the antipode point @xmath .
The singularity of our assignment is of delta function type and realized
in the limit of small @xmath while the singularity of the opposite
assignment is not of delta type since the point 1 is directly crossed.
Moreover in ( 2.206 ) we can see that for @xmath the singularity is of
order @xmath . Hence @xmath is no residual and does not contribute in
integrals like ( 2.106 ).
Therefore we will only consider the case ( 2.203 ) and from here on
simplify our notation to @xmath .
We remark that @xmath iff @xmath . After all we have found a well
defined candidate function:

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.205)
  -- -------- -- ---------

##### Delta source and normalization

In order to construct the Feynman propagator fulfilling the
inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation ( 2.180 ), we again need to show
that applying the Klein-Gordon operator to our candidate functions
yields the desired delta source.
According to ( 2.179 ) we therefor shall examine @xmath in order to show
that it delivers a delta function for the spatial variables @xmath of
the spacetime points @xmath and @xmath . Likewise to the AdS case we
plan to identify @xmath with @xmath .
Starting from equation ( 2.205 ) and employing ( A.27 ) we get

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.206)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Next we put to work the chain rule of differentiation @xmath wherein for
the last factor we can make use of equation ( A.26 ).

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.207)
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

From equation ( 2.202 ) we can read off

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.208)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.209)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

which for the reference point @xmath (with @xmath not necessarily zero)
reduces to the simpler expression

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.210)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

We already found that @xmath iff @xmath i.e. iff @xmath . This means
that for all @xmath we can let @xmath run to zero so that @xmath
vanishes in this case.
In order to determine suitable normalization constants we need to
integrate @xmath over S @xmath . Doing this, we find that the second
summand in equation ( 2.207 ) yields a contribution proportional to
@xmath which therefore vanishes in the limit of small @xmath .
When turning to the first summand, we first compute the S @xmath
-integral over @xmath for the case of our reference point @xmath and
find using integral ( A.20 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath               
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (2.211)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

In the first line of the integration above we already used @xmath .

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.213)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Looking at ( 2.208 ) we see that for @xmath i.e. @xmath we have @xmath .
Therefore using ( A.25 ) we arrive at the desired spatial delta
function:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.214)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

With this relation fixed we can now identify (up to @xmath which is
already included) according to ( 2.55 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.215)
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

and construct the other propagators according to ( 2.76 - 2.81 ).
Evaluating equation ( 2.179 ) we find that the Feynman propagator
fulfills the inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation ( 2.180 ) with one
delta source on its right hand side:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

The normalization constant is:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.216)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Again we do not want the @xmath functions in our normalization constant
to run to infinity. This requirement is fulfilled for all @xmath . In
this case @xmath are either positive or complex and thus the Gamma
functions remain finite (see discussion above equation 2.195 ).

#### 2.3.4 Listing of propagators

Below we list the various propagators for dS @xmath . Herein @xmath is
meant to carry its phase acquired via its position in the complex plane:

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.217)
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Our Wightman function @xmath agrees with the Wightman function which is
given by Spradlin, Strominger and Volovich in [ 28 ] .
Moreover our @xmath -prescription is almost the same as theirs.
Spradlin, Strominger and Volovich use the complex shift @xmath in
embedding space for the @xmath propagator, (but without giving further
information about it). This is the same prescription as in equation (
2.41 ) for Minkowski spacetime. It works well when using the chordal
distance @xmath -terms in equations ( 2.195 ) and ( 2.195 ) but does not
produce meaningful results if the @xmath -terms need to be used.
Our prescription for the propagators @xmath is @xmath together with
@xmath . This is the same as in equation ( 2.42 ) for Minkowski
spacetime and produces meaningful results for both @xmath - and @xmath
-terms. However, as already mentioned above, using the @xmath -version
yields a different constant of normalization compared to the @xmath
-version. Our prescription agrees with the one of Spradlin, Strominger
and Volovich because for @xmath ours leads to @xmath .

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.218)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.219)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.220)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.221)
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.222)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

  -- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath      (2.223)
  -- -------- -------- -- ---------

Therein @xmath (with index F for Feynman) is defined for the limit of
small @xmath as

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

so that the Feynman propagator is indeed symmetric: @xmath . We observe
that in contrast to AdS the sign of the @xmath -term in the Feynman
propagator in dS spacetime is always positive except for @xmath as in
Minkowski spacetime.
For the propagators above the hypergeometric function is defined by its
convergent Taylor series for all @xmath with @xmath . The form of the
propagators for @xmath can be obtained therefrom using ( A.30 ). For
@xmath we can use ( 2.206 ).
Likewise to Minkowski and AdS spacetime we find that the propagators
become singular one the whole embedding space lightcone @xmath while
generating only one delta source at the coincidence point @xmath .
In appendix B.2 we also apply the DvB method for static coordinates.
Again we find agreement in function and normalization with the results
of Spradlin, Strominger and Volovich in [ 28 ] . The only flaw of these
coordinates is the non-invariance of time ordering with respect to
@xmath (see subsection 1.3.5 ).
In both [ 29 ] (see eqs. A.7 and A.10 therein) and [ 28 ] the authors
use the same method as Dullemond and van Beveren in order to derive a
hypergeometric differential equation, but without giving many details on
the @xmath -prescription. In contrast to this the authors of [ 8 ] make
extensive use of mode summation, but do not give an @xmath
-prescription.

## Chapter 3 Summary and Conclusions

We have carried together an overview of the basic geometric properties
of AdS and dS spacetimes in chapter 1 . All coordinate systems are cast
into radial form such that the AdS and dS internal coordinates are
independent of the radii of curvature @xmath and @xmath . The
corresponding metrics are listed thereafter.
Geodesics through a point @xmath on the hyperboloid in embedding space
are examined then and found to be cuts of planes (containing both @xmath
and the origin of embedding space) with the hyperboloid. For AdS
timelike geodesics are found to run on closed ellipses in embedding
space while lightlike geodesics are straight lines and spacelike ones
are hyperbolae. For dS spacetime we find the same forms, just with
inverse causal classification.
For AdS spacetimes time ordering with respect to the time variable
@xmath is found being SO @xmath invariant for causally connected points.
For dS spacetimes time ordering via the time variables @xmath and @xmath
is found being SO @xmath invariant while time ordering via @xmath is not
invariant under SO @xmath transformations moving a point into another
causal diamond.
It would be nice to know also whether the time ordering via @xmath in
Poincaré and planar coordinates for causally connected points is
invariant under the action of SO @xmath respectively SO @xmath , however
for reasons of time this question was not investigated.
We have reviewed the method of Dullemond and van Beveren and applying it
we found all scalar propagators including @xmath -prescriptions for AdS
and dS spacetimes of arbitrary dimension. Depending (up to time ordering
subtleties) only on an SO @xmath respectively SO @xmath invariant
quantity @xmath , the propagators are invariant as well.
For AdS the propagator functions are found to be of the type @xmath with
the parameters @xmath depending on the dimension @xmath of AdS and the
mass @xmath of the scalar field, which is in agreement with the
literature.
For dS spacetime the propagator functions are found to be of the form
@xmath with the parameters @xmath also depending on the dimension @xmath
of dS and the mass @xmath of the scalar field which agrees with the
literature as well.
A convenient advantage of the DvB method is that it permits finding all
propagator functions including @xmath -prescriptions in one fell swoop
without having to perform a mode summation or needing analytic
continuation from euclidean time. Moreover the conformal dimension
@xmath of a corresponding CFT field is delivered as a bonus. A slight
disadvantage lies in the integrals of normalization, which become rather
complicated for general reference points and therefore are calculated
for an especially simple reference point only.
We expect the DvB method to work for all spacetimes ST @xmath of
dimension @xmath which can be embedded in a @xmath -dimensional
embedding space with pseudo-euclidean metric and moreover represent a
hypersurface @xmath for a radial coordinate @xmath of embedding space.
It is worth investigating whether and how the DvB method can be extended
and modified in order to find propagators for gauge fields and matter
fields.

## Appendix A Special functions

### a.1 Dirac’s delta function

In this section concrete realizations of the delta function are
constructed using the d’Alembertian operator, which generally is defined
as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

In an @xmath -dimensional coordinate space V with points @xmath the
@xmath -dimensional delta function is characterized by the following two
properties, which any realization has to fulfill:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.2)
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.3)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Because of equation ( A.2 ) the product @xmath is vanishing at any point
except at @xmath and thus can be replaced by @xmath . Integrating this
product, @xmath can be pulled outside the integral and applying equation
( A.3 ) then yields the useful so-called shifting property:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

The @xmath -dimensional @xmath -function is the product of @xmath
one-dimensional @xmath -functions

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (A.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

with each of them fulfilling ( A.2 ), ( A.3 ) and therefore also ( A.4 )
for @xmath . Moreover we have the following relations [ 30 ] for
one-dimensional @xmath -functions:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.6)
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.7)
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.8)
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.9)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

with @xmath being Heaviside’s step function and @xmath the simple roots
i.e. the zeros with power one of @xmath .
The first considered space is @xmath with the euclidean metric @xmath
which from the general definition of the d’Alembertian returns the
@xmath -dimensional Laplacian @xmath . If we feed the function @xmath to
the Laplacian, we find for @xmath that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For all points @xmath our @xmath can be sent to zero, so the left hand
side of the next equation is a candidate for the delta function in
@xmath .

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The next task is to compute the integral over @xmath of the candidate
function:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

The entire integral has turned out to be independent of @xmath (the
radial integration will be computed at the end of this section). Thus a
realization of the delta function for the @xmath with @xmath has been
found which is well defined for real @xmath .

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

Besides there are solutions of the homogeneous Laplace equation in
@xmath with @xmath and @xmath not necessarily infinitesimal. We can
build them by replacing @xmath which then changes @xmath . They are also
well defined for real @xmath .

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Now @xmath -dimensional Minkowski spacetime is considered. The notation
is @xmath and @xmath . @xmath is @xmath -dimensional spacetime equipped
with @xmath and @xmath is spacetime with @xmath .
This leads to the d’Alembertians @xmath for @xmath and @xmath for @xmath
. @xmath stands for the Minkowski square of the @xmath -vector @xmath
formed with @xmath .
For reasons of brevity we suppress the parameter @xmath in the argument
of the delta function in the following calculations, nevertheless the
variable @xmath can simply be replaced by @xmath , with the
d’Alembertian acting always on @xmath .
We can find the following homogeneous solutions of the d’Alembert
equation in @xmath with @xmath and @xmath not necessarily infinitesimal.
They are well defined for real @xmath .

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.11)
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.12)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

They can be obtained by the shift @xmath which changes the Minkowski
products @xmath and @xmath . Searching candidates for the delta
function, one can check that

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.13)
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.14)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

For @xmath the @xmath can be send to zero giving two candidates for
delta functions @xmath . The next step is showing they actually are
candidates for @xmath . This is done in @xmath with a similar
argumentation holding for @xmath . First the integral below is carried
out on the hyperplane @xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The value of the integral depends only on the sign of the @xmath -value
of the hyperplane. Using the theorem of Gauss

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we can compute the integral of the candidate functions over a slice in
Minkowski spacetime between @xmath and @xmath with @xmath , so the slice
does not contain the origin.

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For @xmath we have the same result. As was found before, we can send
@xmath to zero for @xmath , hence contributions to the integral just
calculated can come from the lightcone @xmath only.
The integrand is symmetric under sign change of each coordinate, so
there is no possibility for a cancellation of nonzero contributions.
With the integral vanishing for arbitrary @xmath and @xmath , i.e. to
position and thickness of the slice, we can conclude that the integrand
must indeed be zero on and off the lightcone except the origin.
In the end of this section we will calculate in detail that

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.15)
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.16)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Thus two realizations of the delta function in @xmath -dimensional
Minkowski spacetime with @xmath are found. They are well defined for
real @xmath .

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.17)
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.18)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Equation ( A.17 ) is in agreement with Dullemond and van Beveren [ 18 ]
wherein the case @xmath is considered.
What remains is to compute the integrals used above. The integral

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

can be calculated using Euler’s Beta function defined in Bronstein [ 11
] as

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using the substitutions @xmath and @xmath we find

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

which for @xmath and @xmath gives just @xmath .
The integrand in ( A.19 ) vanishes for large values of @xmath and
possesses poles at @xmath . Thus the path of integration can be rotated
by @xmath in the complex @xmath -plane without changing the value of the
integral:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

This property is useful for the calculation of the @xmath integral in
@xmath :

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

This is just the result given in ( A.15 ). The other integrals are
solved in the same way, first employing a rotation of the path of
integration in the direction which prevents from crossing the poles, and
then suitably substituting in order to obtain one of the rotated
integrals in ( A.21 ). The values of the four integrals ( A.15 ) and (
A.16 ) all are obtained independently using this method of integration.
When battling with the imaginary roots we can use @xmath and therefore
@xmath . The root of a complex number means the positive root which by
usual definition always is situated in the right half of the complex
plane.
Now the consistency of the prefactors is checked. For complex numbers
@xmath in the upper half of the complex plane we have @xmath while for
complex numbers in the lower half @xmath holds true. Applying this when
comparing ( A.13 ) and ( A.14 ) we find

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Plugging this relation into equation ( A.15 ) yields equation ( A.16 )
confirming the correctness of the integration results given above.

### a.2 Hypergeometric function

In this section we list some properties of hypergeometric functions
which can be found in [ 2 ] by Abramowitz and Stegun and in [ 4 ] by
Bateman and Erdelyi. The hypergeometric differential equation reads:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

It has three singular points at @xmath . The regular solution of the
hypergeometric equation is given by the hypergeometric function, which
is defined as the analytic continuation of the Gauss hypergeometric
series

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.23)
     @xmath   @xmath      (A.24)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

which converges for all @xmath . For @xmath it also converges if Re
@xmath but diverges if Re @xmath .
The hypergeometric function is symmetric under exchange of @xmath and
@xmath and is regular at @xmath with @xmath and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

The first derivation of the hypergeometric function is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (A.26)

Moreover there exist a number of useful linear transformation formulas
for the hypergeometric function:

### b.1 Time ordering and delta sources

In this section we investigate how time ordering prescriptions generate
delta functions in time for the Feynman propagator. We will take the
time ordering on the AdS hyperboloid as an example, with the results for
Minkowski spacetime, the universal covering AdS and dS spacetime
originating from simpler similar computations. Time ordering on the AdS
hyperboloid is given by equation ( 1.67 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (B.1)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Thereby the Feynman propagator reads:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (B.2)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Applying the Klein-Gordon operator yields:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        (B.3)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            @xmath      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  The two terms crossed out cancel each other. On the hyperboloid we have @xmath @xmath and thereby @xmath . Thus the delta functions become nonzero only for @xmath . Inserting these values in ( 2.132 ) we find that @xmath becomes real. Inserting real @xmath in ( 2.156 ) yields @xmath . Therefore we can use @xmath and the two terms crossed out cancel each other for all @xmath and vanish for all other values of @xmath .

  The last two terms vanish since the field @xmath fulfills the homogeneous Klein-Gordon equation. For the next step we use equation ( A.7 ) with @xmath as possible roots of the sine function.

We thereby find that applying the Klein-Gordon operator to the Feynman
propagator generates delta functions in the time variable. Through the
standard time ordering via @xmath in Minkowski spacetime and the
universal covering AdS and @xmath in dS spacetime only one single @xmath
term is generated.
However as a consequence of the special time ordering prescription via
@xmath due to the closed timelike curves on the AdS hyperboloid we
encounter three delta functions in time. We obtain exactly the same
result using the alternative time ordering via @xmath .
The difference of the time derivatives of the Wightman functions @xmath
contributes delta functions for the spatial variables. Therefore
altogether we find that applying the Klein-Gordon operator to the
Feynman propagator produces delta sources in certain spacetime points.
In all cases mentioned above there is one delta source situated at the
coincident point @xmath while on the AdS hyperboloid there also is a
delta source (with factor 2 and opposite sign, see subsection 2.2.3 )
sitting at the antipodal point @xmath .

### b.2 DvB method for de Sitter spacetime in static coordinates

#### b.2.1 General properties of propagators in dS

In this section we apply the method of Dullemond and van Beveren to
deSitter spacetime. The definitions and relations between the different
propagators for hermitian scalar fields @xmath in dS are the same as the
ones listed for AdS in section 2.2.1 . Here @xmath is a point in dS in
static coordinates with @xmath serving as time coordinate. With the
overall sign @xmath of the embedding space’s metric introduced in
equation ( 1.71 ), the Klein-Gordon operator on dS reads @xmath .
Because our field @xmath again fulfills the Klein-Gordon equation, we
have

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.5)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.6)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.7)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

Starting from the definition ( 2.81 ) of the Feynman propagator and
using equation ( 1.97 )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

in combination with the equal time commutation relation @xmath we obtain
(see appendix B.1 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.10)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

This expression contributes a delta function for the time variables of
the spacetime points @xmath and @xmath .
Defining the various propagators as in equations ( 2.74 )-( 2.81 )
corresponds to define as Feynman propagator the function fulfilling the
inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.11)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.12)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

#### b.2.2 From Klein-Gordon to the hypergeometric equation

This subsection is independent of the dS internal coordinates (because
the embedding space coordinates are all given in radial form such that
the dS internal coordinates do not depend on the radius @xmath ) and
therefore is exactly the same as subsection 2.3.2 for the global
coordinates.

#### b.2.3 Inspection of the candidate functions

This subsection is also the same as 2.3.3 for the global coordinates,
only equations ( 2.197 ) and ( 2.198 ) now look different. For the
@xmath coordinate set we obtain instead of ( 2.197 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.13)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

For the origin @xmath as reference point instead of ( 2.198 ) this
reduces to:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.14)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

We see again that for certain values of @xmath our invariant quantities
@xmath can become one which is pathologic because @xmath is divergent in
@xmath .

##### Infinitesimal shift in complex time plane

In order to remove this we apply again a shift in the complex time plane

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

which results in complex coordinates @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

We can check that @xmath , @xmath and therefore @xmath . We leave @xmath
and thereby @xmath unchanged. In the limit of small @xmath we find

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

Next we define

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.16)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.17)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

For small @xmath this definition of @xmath yields

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (B.18)
              @xmath      (B.19)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

so that again we have @xmath .
@xmath is SO @xmath invariant but unfortunately sign @xmath is not
generally invariant under orthochronous SO @xmath (see subsection 1.3.5
) which is a drawback of this coordinate set.
While the @xmath term is present, the point 1 is always evaded. We
observe that the @xmath term vanishes only for @xmath . In this case we
have

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

For @xmath we find @xmath and further on

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.20)
     @xmath      (B.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

We see that in the upper line @xmath is always separated from 1 by
@xmath while in the lower line a finite @xmath for @xmath would lead to
@xmath . Thereby it is clear that @xmath is the right quantity for
@xmath and @xmath is the right one for @xmath . This assignment is the
same found for the global coordinates in subsection 2.3.3 . Therefore we
will only consider the case ( B.20 ) and from here on simplify our
notation to @xmath .
We remark that @xmath and thereby @xmath if and only if @xmath . After
all we have found the well defined function

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

##### Delta source and normalization

In order to construct the Feynman propagator fulfilling the
inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation ( B.11 ), we now want to show that
applying the Klein-Gordon operator to our candidate functions yields the
desired delta source.
According to ( B.10 ) we therefor need to examine @xmath in order to
show that it delivers a delta function for the spatial variables of the
spacetime points @xmath and @xmath . Likewise to the AdS case we plan to
identify @xmath with @xmath .
Starting from equation ( B.22 ) and employing ( A.27 ) we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (B.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

Next we put to work the chain rule of differentiation @xmath wherein for
the last factor we can make use of equation ( A.26 ).

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.24)
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

From equation ( B.2.3 ) we can read off that for small @xmath we have

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.25)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.26)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

which for our special reference point @xmath reduces to the simpler
expression

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.27)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

We already found that @xmath and thereby @xmath if and only if @xmath .
This means that for all @xmath we can let @xmath run to zero so that
@xmath vanishes for this case.
In order to determine suitable normalisation constants we need to
integrate @xmath over @xmath dimensional @xmath -space with the
rectriction @xmath . Doing so, we find that the second summand in
equation ( B.24 ) yields a contribution proportional to @xmath which
therefore vanishes in the limit of small @xmath .
When turning to the first summand, we first compute the @xmath -space
integral over @xmath for the case of our reference point @xmath and find
using integral ( A.20 ):

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (B.28)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.29)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Looking at ( B.25 ) we see that for @xmath we have @xmath . Therefore
using ( A.25 ) we arrive at the desired spatial delta function:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.30)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

With this relation fixed we can now identify:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.31)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

and construct the other propagators according to ( 2.76 - 2.81 ). Now we
can step back and evaluate equation ( B.10 ):

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

We see that the Feynman propagator fulfills just the inhomogeneous
Klein-Gordon equation ( B.11 ) with one delta source on its right hand
side:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

The normalization constant is:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.32)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Again we do not want the @xmath functions in our normalization constant
to run to infinity. This requirement is fulfilled for all @xmath . In
this case @xmath are either positive or complex and thus the Gamma
functions remain finite (see discussion above equation 2.195 ).

#### b.2.4 Listing of propagators

Below we list the various propagators for dS @xmath . Herein @xmath is
meant to carry its phase acquired via its position in the complex plane:

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (B.33)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Our Wightman function @xmath agrees with the Wightman function given by
Spradlin, Strominger and Volovich in [ 28 ] .
However our @xmath prescription for static coordinates differs from
theirs. They use the complex shift @xmath in embedding space (without
giving further information). Following Dullemond and van Beveren we
employed a complex shift for the time variable of deSitter spacetime
which turned out to produce reasonable results, except for the
noninvariance of the time ordering for @xmath under SO @xmath .

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.34)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.35)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.36)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.37)
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.38)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath      (B.39)
  -- -------- -------- -- --------

Therein @xmath (with index F for Feynman) is defined for the limit of
small @xmath as

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

so that the Feynman propagator is indeed symmetric: @xmath . We observe
that in contrast to AdS the sign of the @xmath -term in the Feynman
propagator in dS spacetime is always positive except for @xmath as in
Minkowski spacetime. For the next remark we repeat the structure of
@xmath :

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

For the propagators above the hypergeometric function is defined by its
convergent Taylor series for all @xmath with @xmath . The form of the
propagators for @xmath can be obtained therefrom using ( A.30 ). For
@xmath we can use ( B.23 ).
Likewise to Minkowski and AdS spacetime we find that the propagators
become singular one the whole embedding space lightcone @xmath while
generating only one delta source at the coincidence point @xmath .
