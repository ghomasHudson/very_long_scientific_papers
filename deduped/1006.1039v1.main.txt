## Acknowledgements

At the end of my tenure at Satyendra Nath Bose National Centre for Basic
Sciences (SNBNCBS), I would like to express my gratitude to the people
who have made this amazing journey possible and recollect some of their
contributions.

My thesis supervisor Prof. Rabin Banerjee has been inspirational in this
entire period and without his expert guidance I won’t have been where I
am today. It has been a wonderful learning experience and a great
privilege to work under Prof. Rabin Banerjee. His valuable suggestions
and clear insights have lent me a fascinating point of view into the
working of physics and by extension, nature. To him goes my heartfelt
respect and gratitude.

Prof. Binayak Dutta Roy has always been available with his able guidance
and considerable repertoire of knowledge. I sincerely thank him for all
those intense academic discussions. I would like to thank Dr. Pradip
Mukherjee for sharing with me his insightful and innovative ideas which
led to some very fruitful discussions. I am grateful to Dr. Biswajit
Chakraborty for his enthusiastic discussions on physics.

I am indebted to Prof. S. Dattagupta, ex. Director of SNBNCBS, for

Director, for many facilities I enjoyed in this centre.

I thank all the academic and administrative staff of Bose centre for
helping me in many ways. Particularly I would like to mention the
Library staff for their excellent support.

I have been fortunate enough to count some very bright and brilliant
persons as my ‘group-mates’ namely Kuldeep, Shailesh, Bibhas, Sujoy. The
named four and others like Sunandan, Arindam, Chandrasekhar and Saikat
have contributed much to my stay at SNBNCBS, both in an academic sense
and otherwise. It has been a rewarding experience working with them.

To my seniors Shanta-da, Abhishek-da, and Mani-da I would like to
express my gratitude for the brotherly care and support provided by them
during my initial days at the center. To Ankush, who was more a friend
than a senior I convey my warmest thanks and regards.

My batch mates – Kartick, Anjan, Kunal, Manoranjan and Manoj provided
pleasant companionship for which I shall be ever grateful.

The varied group comprising of hyper enthusiastic Sagar at one extreme
to sedate Ashish at another with impish Santosh and the unlikely trio of
Arya, Tamoghna and Bipul somewhere around the middle, constitute my
junior batch at SNBNCBS! With a list like that, it does not take a
physicist to gather that my experiences with them has been dramatic,
funny and in general out of the ordinary! I highly admire my young
friends Amartya, Anirban and Shantanu for their weird imagination. I
shall never forget our long discussions on fiction and fantasy.

In my home village I have many friends and well-wishers. Gautam and
Rinku deserve special mention for their company throughout the years. I
am indebted to my seniors Tarun, Atanu, Aniruddha for their helpful
attitude on many occasions. I express my love and gratitude to my cousin
Anirban and nephews Arya, Adrish, Chayan, Ayan, Sayan, Alapan.

My thesis will be incomplete if I don’t acknowledge the role my family
has played. Without their unflinching support this journey would have
been impossible. My sister has been a source of joy in my life and
without her my existence would have been dry indeed. To my parents who
have borne great demands on my part with a smiling face I convey my deep
felt respect and love. Having stayed away from home for a large part of
my life due to educational constraints, their encouragement and belief
in me has provided the motivation to withstand the hardships and
difficult situations for all these years.

## Chapter 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Historical background

The idea of noncommutativity first comes in physics via quantum
mechanics where the position and momentum variables @xmath satisfy the
Heisenberg commutation relation @xmath . A consequence is the
uncertainty relation @xmath . So the concept of point does not exist in
quantum phase space, instead it is replaced by Planck cell. It was von
Neumann who first attempted to describe such a space by “pointless
geometry”. In this way Neumann algebra was formulated which leads to
noncommutative geometry for studying topological spaces whose
commutative @xmath -algebras of functions are replaced by noncommutative
algebras [ 1 ] . Here the notion of point is discarded and space is
understood in purely algebraic terms. The generalization of differential
calculus in a noncommutative setting was also done by the mathematicians
[ 2 , 3 ] . Various mathematical tools were further developed by Connes
and his collaborators to define a noncommutative Yang–Mills theory [ 4 ]
and particle models [ 5 ] .

In physical problems the concept of phase space noncommutativity was
extended to noncommutativity among coordinates by Heisenberg himself. In
a letter to Peierls [ 6 ] , he proposed coordinate uncertainty relation
as a solution to avoid the singularities of the electron self energy.
Later these ideas were used by Peierls in Landau level related problem.
Pauli also came to know this idea from Heisenberg and informed
Oppenheimer about it [ 7 ] . In @xmath , Hartland Snyder, a student of
Oppenheimer published the first paper [ 8 ] on this subject. By a
dimensional descent from five dimensions he obtained a Lorentz invariant
discrete space-time in which a natural unit of length exists. His hope
was that such a length scale may remove the infinities of field theory.
In the same year C. N. Yang generalized Snyder’s work in curved de
Sitter space [ 9 ] . Although the main stream interest was shifting from
noncommutative physics due to the contemporary success of
renormalization theory, mathematicians were still working in this field.
The main source of inspiration came from the noncommutativity of quantum
mechanics and many ideas were borrowed from that.

In order to quantize a theory, Dirac gave a simple prescription of
replacing the classical variables by operators and Poisson bracket by
commutator bracket (divided by @xmath ). The mapping between classical
kernels which are @xmath -number phase space function @xmath and the
corresponding operator @xmath with proper ordering was first given by
Weyl [ 10 ] . As an example, a polynomial function of @xmath is ordered
in a completely symmetrized way which is usually called the Weyl
ordering prescription. The importance of the composition rule of
classical kernels in an operator product was first realized by von
Neumann [ 11 ] in a study of the uniqueness of the Schrödinger
representation. Then Groenewold did the necessary calculation [ 12 ] to
obtain the composition rule of two operators @xmath and @xmath
corresponding to the classical kernels @xmath and @xmath and how it is
related to @xmath . This was used by Moyal to formulate the quantum
mechanics in phase space [ 13 ] .

In 1964, Mead in his paper [ 14 ] carefully analyzed many thought
experiments to study the effect of gravitation on measuring the position
of a particle. He concluded that there is always an error @xmath where
@xmath is the gravitational constant in natural units. A similar
restriction also exists for the measurement of time interval. The result
can be understood heuristically by realizing that to get high resolution
one needs high energy photons but higher energy means high gravitational
interaction and this will seriously affect the spacetime.

Uncertainty relation, in quantum mechanics, comes as a consequence of
the non vanishing commutator algebra which is an inbuilt kinematic
structure of the theory. Hence there were attempts to give a kinematical
meaning to the position uncertainty described by Mead. In Townsend’s
paper [ 15 ] Planck length appears in gravity due to the
noncommutativity of the generators of translations. Maggiore extended
the ideas [ 16 , 17 ] to get a general noncommutative algebra where
position-position bracket was nonzero. Doplicher, Fredenhagen and
Roberts developed a model of quantum spacetime [ 18 , 19 ] which imply
uncertainty relations among different coordinates. They also gave some
general ideas on the definition of fields and their interactions over
this space.

String theory which is supposed to describe quantum theory of gravity
contains an intrinsic length, the length of the string @xmath .
Naturally it is not possible to probe a distance smaller than @xmath .
Detailed analysis based on high energy scattering amplitudes [ 20 , 21 ,
22 ] showed the existence of minimum length. Not only that, the
techniques of noncommutative geometry have been applied to rigorously
study the duality symmetries of string theory [ 23 , 24 ] . Later it was
shown that noncommutative geometry arises due to the toroidal
compactification of the matrix model [ 25 ] . In fact these matrix
models lead to noncommutative Yang-Mills theory as their effective field
theory. Seiberg and Witten in their seminal paper [ 26 ] extended the
ideas of noncommutativity in string theory with a nonzero @xmath field.
They showed an equivalence between ordinary gauge fields and
noncommutative gauge fields which is usually called the Seiberg–Witten
map. Till now, this map has been applied in various research areas from
Hall effect, fluid dynamics, field theory to gravity. Different types of
noncommutative structures have also been studied without referring to
their commutative counterpart. A general overview of this broad subject
may be found in [ 27 , 28 , 29 ] .

The simplest form of noncommutativity is the canonical noncommutativity
where position position bracket is a constant. The algebra itself and
field theories defined on such a space are known to violate the Lorentz
invariance. However, a deformed Poincar @xmath symmetry can be developed
where the usual Poincar @xmath algebra is satisfied but the generators
have a deformed coproduct rule [ 30 , 31 ] . As a result, noncommutative
field theory possesses the symmetry under the deformed (Hopf) Poincar
@xmath algebra. Interesting consequences of this deformed symmetry have
been studied in [ 32 , 33 ] . The issues regarding the parity and time
reversal symmetry have also gained attention in the literature [ 34 , 35
, 36 ] .

Apart from the space-time symmetry, the gauge symmetries of a
noncommutative field theory is also an important topic. The study,
without the use of Seiberg-Witten map, was initiated by [ 35 ] . A
noncommutative version of the standard model was also developed [ 37 ,
38 ] . Noncommutative gauge theory has also been studied using the
Seiberg–Witten map [ 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 ] .

Recently an interesting study was done in the literature [ 43 , 44 ] by
twisting the coproduct rule of both the Poincar @xmath generators and
gauge generators. The result obtained was quite remarkable: the
noncommutative theory turned out to be invariant under the commutative
space gauge transformations. The issue, whether this twisted gauge
invariance is a real physical symmetry or not has been discussed later [
45 , 46 ] . Gravity, which is also a gauge theory, has been formulated
over noncommutative spacetime. There are different approaches, in [ 47 ]
the theory was constructed by gauging the noncommutative @xmath group
using the Seiberg–Witten map, but there are also constructions based on
a deformed Poincar @xmath algebra [ 48 ] . A different approach was
followed in [ 49 ] where noncommutative gravity was obtained from string
theory in the Seiberg–Witten limit.

### 1.2 Structure of the thesis

This thesis, based on the work [ 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 ] , is
devoted to study different aspects of quantum mechanics, field theory
and gravity on noncommutative spaces. We give particular emphasis on the
symmetry properties (both spacetime and gauge) of noncommutative
theories. The outline of our thesis is as follows

In chapter 2, we discuss the noncommutative algebra of the generalized
Landau problem where a charged particle is subjected to a quadratic
potential with a perpendicular constant magnetic field. This is done by
two approaches. In the first method we use the Batalin–Tyutin embedding
technique to reveal the noncommutative structures. Different types of
noncommutativity follow from different gauge choices. In the other
approach, the model is mapped to a chiral oscillator problem. Both
methods establish a duality among the noncommutativity of coordinates
and the noncommutativity of momenta.

The gravitational well problem on a noncommutative phase space has been
discussed in chapter 3. We use the WKB approximation to study the effect
of noncommutativity analytically. Comparison with recent experimental
data with cold neutrons at Grenoble imposes an upper bound on the
noncommutative parameter.

One feature of noncommutative algebra is that it violates the usual
spacetime symmetries. For example, in the canonical noncommutativity
translatioal symmetry is obeyed but the Lorentz symmetry is violated. In
the Snyder algebra situation is quite opposite–Lorentz symmetry is
restored but the translational symmetry is lost. These symmetry related
issues are addressed in chapter 4. Schrödinger generators which consist
of the Galilean generators and the nonrelativistic version of two
conformal generators do not satisfy the standard algebra on the
canonical noncommutative space. Following an algebraic approach, we
construct the deformed generators which satisfy the usual commutative
space algebra. Then a dynamical model is constructed whose symplectic
analysis gives the canonical noncommutative algebra. Using the Nöther’s
theorem we obtain the same deformed generators from this model. This
shows the consistency of two approaches. Similar analysis is also
performed for the Snyder type noncommutativity to obtain the deformed
Poincar @xmath -conformal generators.

In the next chapter, we discuss the gauge symmetries of the
noncommutative Yang–Mills theory in a Lagrangian framework. By
abstracting a connection between gauge symmetry and gauge identity, we
analyze star (deformed) gauge transformations with usual Leibniz rule as
well as undeformed gauge transformations with a twisted Leibniz rule.
Explicit structures of the Lagrangian gauge generators in either case
are computed. We show that, in the former case, the relation mapping the
generator with the gauge identity is a star deformation of the
commutative space result. In the latter case, on the other hand, this
result gets twisted to yield the desired map.

Hamiltonian analysis of the same noncommutative gauge theory is studied
in chapter 6. Both types of gauge transformations are considered. Using
the constraint analysis we show that the structure of the Hamiltonian
gauge generator is identical in either case. The difference comes in the
computation of the graded Poisson brackets to get the gauge
transformations of the fields. The analysis for the undeformed gauge
transformations provides a novel interpretation of the twisted coproduct
rule. We find that it is same as the normal coproduct with the
stipulation that the gauge parameter is taken outside the star operation
at the end of the computations.

In chapter 7, we discuss general relativity over a Lie algebra valued
noncommutative spacetime. We follow the minimal (unimodular) formulation
where the physical symmetries are manifest. Gauging the Poincar @xmath
group, we exploit the Seiberg – Witten map technique to formulate the
theory as a perturbative Lagrangian theory. Detailed expressions of the
Seiberg – Witten maps for the gauge parameters, gauge potentials and the
field strengths have been worked out. We find a remarkable result that
the first order correction of the noncommutative gravity action is zero,
exactly as is the case for canonical noncommutativity. Finally, we end
up with conclusions in chapter 8.

## Chapter 2 Generalized Landau problem and phase space noncommutativity

In order to study noncommutativity in quantum mechanics, Landau problem
is a standard model where a charged particle moving on a plane is
subjected to a constant magnetic field in the perpendicular direction.
Usually people study it by introducing noncommuting coordinates by hand
or by introducing noncommuting momenta due to the peculiar structure of
canonical momenta which depends on the magnetic field. Both theoretical
[ 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61 , 62 ] and phenomenological [ 63 , 64 , 65 , 66
] studies have been done to reveal various interesting points of this
problem. However in this chapter we take a generalized version of the
Landau problem where an additional quadratic potential is present
together with the usual constant magnetic field. Here noncommutativity
is not introduced by hand; rather it is a consequence of the modified
symplectic structure. We follow two methods, first the Batalin–Tyutin [
67 ] embedding approach and next, the doublet splitting [ 68 ] method to
analyze the noncommutative structure of this problem.

We treat the generalized problem as a constrained Hamiltonian system for
which a first order formulation is most natural. In this formulation the
number of variables is doubled; moreover second class constraints occur.
The Poisson brackets therefore get replaced by the Dirac brackets [ 69 ]
which are finally elevated to the level of commutators. The Dirac
brackets among both sets of dynamical variables lead to noncommuting
structures.

Next, we embed this second class system in an extended space by
introducing new pairs of canonical variables such that the original
system is converted into a first class one. This embedded system is
therefore considered as a true gauge theory. By choosing the unitary
gauge which amounts to setting the new variables to zero, the original
second class system is recovered. We then discuss two particular gauge
choices in some details. These choices are done such that, in either
case, the two sets of dynamical variables can be regarded as coordinates
and their conjugate momenta. However one gauge choice leads to commuting
coordinates but noncommuting momenta while the other choice yields
commuting momenta but noncommuting coordinates. Since these distinct
structures follow from the same master gauge theory, a duality is
established between them.

This type of duality between different noncommutative structures is
further confirmed by doublet splitting where a general mapping between
the variables of generalized Landau problem and the variables of chiral
oscillators is established. Instead of giving a theory on quantum
mechanical representation [ 70 ] we stress on the dual nature of
noncommuting Poisson brackets and Lagrangian framework.

### 2.1 The model: generalized Landau problem

The classical equations of motion for an electron ¹ ¹ 1 We have
rationalized @xmath . moving in the @xmath plane under the influence of
a constant perpendicular magnetic field @xmath are,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

The above equations of motion follow from the Lagrangian,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

The canonical momentum

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

is clearly different from the kinematic momentum @xmath by a term
proportional to the magnetic field. This leads to the canonical
Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now we generalize the Landau problem by introducing an oscillating
potential with spring constant @xmath in the @xmath plane. The equations
of motion are

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

It is convenient to express the second order system in its first order
form. Furthermore following ’t Hooft [ 71 , 72 , 73 ] , let the
equations of motion of a system @xmath , be a function of position
alone. Then denoting @xmath as the conjugate momenta, we note that the
Hamiltonian @xmath does not have a lower bound. A positive-definite
function @xmath , considered as the physical Hamiltonian, can be
constructed such that @xmath . But this change from the original
(unbounded) Hamiltonian @xmath to the bounded positive (semi) definite
Hamiltonian @xmath leads to a modified algebra that can be obtained as
follows [ 68 ] :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

To reproduce the original set of equations of motion, obviously one
should take

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

leading to a nontrivial algebra of @xmath , eventually leading to
noncommuting structures.

Now the noncommutativity of the generalized Landau problem appears by
writing the second order system into a pair of first order equations by
doubling the degrees of freedom [ 68 ] . Consider the pair of first
order equations

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.8)
     @xmath      (2.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

which lead to the Landau type equations in both @xmath and @xmath [ 68 ]
,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

By identifying,

  -- -- -- -------- -- --------
           @xmath      (2.11)
           @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -- -- -------- -- --------

( 2.10 ) is regarded as a generic version of ( 2.5 ). A Hamiltonian is
now constructed [ 68 , 71 ] ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are canonical pairs. The equations of motion
@xmath just yield ( 2.8 ) and  ( 2.9 ). As usual, this @xmath is not
bounded from below. A positive definite @xmath , commuting with @xmath ,
has to be obtained. This @xmath gets identified with the physical
Hamiltonian [ 68 , 71 , 72 , 73 ] . A natural choice satisfying @xmath
is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

The corresponding algebra is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

This algebra leads to noncommuting structures for both @xmath and @xmath
so that the equations of motion ( 2.8 ) and ( 2.9 ) can be reproduced
from @xmath . Now we are in a position to construct the Lagrangian for
this generalized Landau problem. The physical concept behind this
construction is given in [ 74 ] .

First a @xmath matrix is constructed from the basic brackets  ( 2.16 )

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.17)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Its inverse is

  -- -- -- --------
           (2.18)
  -- -- -- --------

Using ( 2.15 ) and ( 2.12 ) we show

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

to write ( 2.18 ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

The Lagrangian is therefore [ 68 ] ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.21)
              @xmath   @xmath      (2.22)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

We get the following equations of motion from the above Lagrangian

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.23)
     @xmath      (2.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

These are compatible with  ( 2.8 ) and  ( 2.9 ) under the conditions (
2.15 , 2.19 ). Since  ( 2.8 ) and  ( 2.9 ) reproduced ( 2.10 ), the
system described by the Lagrangian ( 2.22 ) and that described by ( 2.10
) are same. Of course both the variables @xmath and @xmath satisfy the
same equation of motion ( 2.10 ) and hence there is a symmetry between
them.

### 2.2 Noncommutativity from Batalin–Tyutin framework

According to Dirac’s [ 69 ] analysis of constrained systems, the
constraints with weakly vanishing Poisson’s bracket are called first
class constraints (FCC), others are called second class constraints
(SCC). The FCC constraints induce gauge invariance in the theory whereas
Dirac brackets are consequences of the SCC.

In the Batalin–Tyutin formalism, new auxiliary variables are introduced
in the system containing SCC in such a way that the original SCC can be
modified to a set of FCC. Also, the original Hamiltonian has to be
altered appropriately to make the resulting system gauge invariant.

The canonical momenta corresponding to the coordinates @xmath and @xmath
for the Lagrangian ( 2.22 ) are given by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.25)
     @xmath      (2.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus they form the constraints:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.27)
     @xmath      (2.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

The commutator matrix for the above constraints is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.29)
              @xmath   @xmath      (2.30)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Since the constraint matrix is nonsingular, inverse of ( 2.30 ) exists.
It is given by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

According to Dirac’s classification [ 69 ] ( 2.27 ) and ( 2.28 ) are
second class constraints. The Dirac brackets defined by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

gives the algebra

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

which reproduces ( 2.16 ). This algebra shows a more general type of
noncommutativity than that of [ 75 ] where momenta-momenta bracket is
zero.

In order to convert the second class constraints ( 2.27 ) and ( 2.28 )
into first class constraints a canonical set of auxiliary variables is
introduced

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now we define the following constraints

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.35)
     @xmath      (2.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

so that the algebra of the constraints ( 2.35 ) and ( 2.36 ) is strongly
involutive ( @xmath ). Hence the constraints are first class. Also note
that @xmath .

To obtain the first class Hamiltonian we begin by constructing the
improved variables [ 75 , 76 , 77 ] . Improved variables are first class
counterparts of the original variables @xmath and @xmath . These are
given by

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where @xmath and @xmath are given by ( 2.37 ). One can easily check

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

so that they are first class indeed. They satisfy the algebra

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

which mimics ( 2.33 ) and is a consequence of a general theorem [ 67 ]
which states that @xmath .

Any function of the phase space variables can be made first class by the
following transformation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

Hence the first class Hamiltonian is given by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is interesting to note that the equations of motion are form
invariant i. e. improved variables satisfy the same equations of motion
( 2.8 ) and ( 2.9 ). This is just a result of the form invariance of the
Hamiltonian and the algebra among the basic variables.

In the enlarged space different gauge conditions can be chosen to show
the different types of noncommutative structures. For example in the
unitary gauge

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

we get back the original physical subspace with the algebra ( 2.33 ).

Next, we choose gauge condition such that @xmath in which case these
variables may be regarded as canonical pairs. In one gauge we obtain
noncommuting momenta while in the other, noncommuting coordinates are
found. Let us choose the gauge conditions,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.43)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.44)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are given by the expressions ( 2.37 ) and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.45)
     @xmath      (2.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

For this choice we get the Dirac algebra

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is the standard commutative Landau model algebra where the bracket
among the momenta gives the magnetic field.

Alternatively, we choose the following gauge constraints

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.48)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.49)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

with the following values of the coefficients,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.50)
     @xmath      (2.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

to get the algebra

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is the noncommutative Landau model with usual momenta algebra. We
thus conclude that the standard (commutative) and noncommutative Landau
models are dual aspects of the same parent model.

### 2.3 Alternative approach based on doublet structure

The original model ( 2.22 ) has two sets of variables. It is possible to
express this by a doublet of models with an appropriate separation of
variables. This doublet structure is basically the soldering formalism
discussed in various papers [ 78 , 79 ] . Consider the Lagrangians

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.53)
     @xmath      (2.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

with positive @xmath and @xmath . They represent the motion of one
dimensional (chiral) oscillators rotating in the clockwise and
anticlockwise directions. Suitable combination of these chiral
oscillators leads to a two-dimensional oscillator which has been studied
in [ 80 ] in the context of Zeeman effect. Here our motivation is to
define two variables @xmath and @xmath from the chiral oscillator
variables @xmath and @xmath in such a way that @xmath and @xmath satisfy
the correct equations of motion and algebras of the generalized Landau
problem.

The equations of motion following from ( 2.53 ) and ( 2.54 ) are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.55)
     @xmath      (2.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

To illustrate ’t Hooft’s mechanism [ 68 , 71 , 72 , 73 ] we start from
 ( 2.55 ). The Hamiltonian which gives the equation of motion  ( 2.55 )
is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

This can be checked easily using the equation of motion @xmath . Since
this Hamiltonian has no lower bound we take a physical Hamiltonian
@xmath which commutes with @xmath .

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

To reproduce  ( 2.55 ) basic algebras should be taken as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

so that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

leads to the correct equation of motion. Same calculation for the other
equation of motion  ( 2.56 ) gives the physical Hamiltonian

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the algebra

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now in order to calculate the Lagrangian from the relation ( 2.21 ), we
construct the @xmath matrix for ( 2.59 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

and its inverse is

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

So the Lagrangian is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.63)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

which is our initial expression for chiral oscillator Lagrangian  ( 2.53
).

#### 2.3.1 Mapping between the equations of motion

We make an ansatz

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now using ( 2.8 ),  ( 2.55 ) and  ( 2.56 ) one can write @xmath in terms
of @xmath and @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

Taking the time derivative of the above equation and using ( 2.55 ) and
( 2.56 ) we get,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

Again using ( 2.64 ) and  ( 2.65 ) in ( 2.9 ) we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

So consistency between  ( 2.66 ) and  ( 2.67 ) demands

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.68)
     @xmath      (2.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

From the above two equations, using ( 2.11 ), ( 2.12 ) and ( 2.15 ) we
can show

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.70)
  -- -------- -- --------

This important result shows that magnetic field appears as the
difference whereas the spring constant is a product of the chiral
frequencies.

#### 2.3.2 Mapping between the algebra

Using the definitions of @xmath and @xmath from ( 2.64 ) and  ( 2.65 )
we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.71)
     @xmath      (2.72)
     @xmath      (2.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have used ( 2.59 , 2.62 ) and consistency with the algebra (
2.16 ).

The above three equations are not independent. From the last two
equations, using ( 2.68 ) and ( 2.69 ) one can obtain the following
relations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.74)
  -- -------- -- --------

These pair of equations give the expressions so that variables of the
generalized Landau problem can be defined in terms of the chiral
variables with the help of ( 2.64 ) and  ( 2.65 ). The interesting point
is that the coefficients @xmath and @xmath are not completely
determined. Different choices subject to ( 2.74 ) can be made which
exactly reproduce the results for different gauge fixings.

### 2.4 Special cases

We note that ( 2.11 ), ( 2.12 ) and ( 2.15 ) already give severe
restrictions on the parameters @xmath and @xmath . In order to give them
specific values we set @xmath so that @xmath . Now ( 2.15 ) implies that
this choice of @xmath fixes the value of @xmath as @xmath . Using these
values of @xmath and @xmath we get @xmath from ( 2.12 ). That means
either @xmath or @xmath is zero. In the following two subsections these
situations are studied separately.

#### 2.4.1 Case 1

We consider @xmath first. Then from ( 2.11 ) @xmath . Let us now collect
the special values of the parameters mentioned so far

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.75)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the parameters ( 2.75 ), the basic brackets following from ( 2.16 )
are given by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.76)
  -- -------- -- --------

This structure is same as ( 2.47 ) and corresponds to the conventional
Landau algebra.

Now to find the connection with the chiral oscillator problem, we take (
2.68 ) and ( 2.74 ). From ( 2.68 ) we can choose either @xmath or @xmath
independently. We make the choice @xmath . This implies that @xmath is
fixed by the relation,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.77)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the above equation we get from ( 2.74 ),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.78)
  -- -------- -- --------

Again as mentioned earlier @xmath and @xmath are not uniquely determined
by ( 2.78 ). Different choices can be made. One can take the symmetrical
combination where @xmath and @xmath are all equal. But to proceed
further we make the following asymmetrical choice

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.79)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- --------

so that ( 2.64 ) and ( 2.65 ) imply

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.80)
     @xmath      (2.81)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now using ( 2.59 , 2.62 ) the basic brackets are easy to calculate

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.82)
     @xmath      (2.83)
     @xmath      (2.84)
  -- -------- -- --------

This algebra is compatible with  ( 2.76 ) under the identifications (
2.70 ). Thus we see, transforming our second order system to a first
order one by introducing an additional variable, noncommutativity is
naturally induced. Again this result is reproduced by superposition of
two chiral oscillators, which are also first order systems. Since the
difference in the chiral frequencies is proportional to the magnetic
field the connection of two approaches gets established.

#### 2.4.2 Case 2

To show the situation where the momenta are commuting we take @xmath ,
then from ( 2.11 ) @xmath . So all the values of parameters are listed
below.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.85)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this case the basic brackets of the Landau problem following from the
algebra  ( 2.16 ) are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.86)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that algebras given by ( 2.52 ) and ( 2.86 ) are structurally
equivalent.

Now we have to find the corresponding situation in the chiral oscillator
problem. In the previous subsection @xmath was taken to be zero in (
2.68 ). Now to generate commuting momenta @xmath is set to be zero. Then
we take the following asymmetrical choice of the coefficients from (
2.74 )

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Putting these values of the coefficients in ( 2.64 ) and ( 2.65 ) we
observe that @xmath and @xmath are now defined by the relations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.87)
     @xmath      (2.88)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the algebra ( 2.59 , 2.62 ) it is easy to show that they satisfy
the following algebra

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.89)
     @xmath      (2.90)
     @xmath      (2.91)
  -- -------- -- --------

We note that above algebra and ( 2.86 ) also match under the same
identifications ( 2.70 ).

In section 2.2 we saw from Batalin–Tyutin extended space framework of
generalized Landau problem how the usual (commutative) and
noncommutative Landau models were related by gauge transformations. Now
we have discussed an alternative approach where the general problem is
expressed, through certain parameters, by a doublet structure. The
connection between two formulation is that different parametric choices
correspond to distinct gauge fixings in the extended space approach.

### 2.5 Construction of Lagrangian

The motivation for doing this calculation is to establish an equivalence
between the generalized Landau problem and chiral oscillators at the
Lagrangian level.

#### 2.5.1 Case 1

For the values of parameters given in ( 2.75 ) we get the Lagrangian
from ( 2.22 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.92)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath is an auxiliary variable, it can be eliminated using its
equation of motion @xmath to yield,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.93)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now we have to find the composite (soldered) Lagrangian [ 68 , 78 , 80 ]
for the chiral oscillators

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.94)
  -- -------- -- --------

We take @xmath as defined in ( 2.80 ) and write @xmath in terms @xmath
and @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.95)
  -- -------- -- --------

We substitute the expression of @xmath in the Lagrangian ( 2.94 ) to get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.96)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath is an auxiliary variable it can be eliminated from the
above Lagrangian using its equation of motion to yield,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.97)
  -- -------- -- --------

We observe that the Lagrangians  ( 2.97 ) and ( 2.93 ) are same under
the previous identification  ( 2.70 ).

#### 2.5.2 Case 2

When momenta are commuting variables, using ( 2.85 ) we have from ( 2.22
)

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.98)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now we can eliminate @xmath from ( 2.98 ) using its equation of motion
to get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.99)
  -- -------- -- --------

Following the method of previous subsection we can calculate the
composite Lagrangian from ( 2.88 ) and ( 2.94 )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (2.100)
  -- -------- -- ---------

We note that Lagrangians  ( 2.100 ) and  ( 2.99 ) are again identical
with the mapping ( 2.70 ).

### 2.6 Discussion

Batalin–Tyutin extended space framework of generalized Landau problem
clearly shows the dual nature of different types of noncommutativity.
The usual (commutative) and noncommutative Landau models are obtained as
different gauge fixed versions of a parent gauge invariant model.

Moreover chiral oscillators and generalized Landau problem are related
very closely. Here we have established a mapping between them. It is
interesting that in the generalized Landau problem noncommutativity may
appear in position variables or in momenta or in both. By suitably
defining variables from chiral coordinates each type of noncommutativity
can be reproduced. The important point is that this mapping exists not
only at the algebraic level but also at the Lagrangian level. In the
later case, we have shown the important role played by soldering method
[ 68 , 78 , 80 ] to understand the mapping properly.

## Chapter 3 Noncommutative gravitational quantum well

In the previous chapter we have discussed the generalized Landau problem
where the shifting of noncommutativity was shown from the coordinates to
the momenta and vice-versa. Also, the implications of noncommutativity
in both phase space and configuration space variables were discussed. In
this chapter we study the phenomenology of a quantum mechanical model
with constant noncommutativity in both coordinates and momenta.

The energy eigenstates of a particle confined in a potential well have
been calculated for different force fields. Various experiments have
been done for the atomic and nuclei models to observe the effects of
electromagnetic and strong forces on elementary particle but performing
a quantum mechanical experiment in the gravitational field is extremely
difficult due to its weak nature compared to other force fields. Few
years back, Nesvizhevsky et. al. [ 81 , 82 , 83 ] completed an
experiment at Grenoble and observed the first few energy states for the
gravitational well. In order to build a potential well gravitational
field alone is not sufficient since it forces a particle to fall along
field lines. They put a reflecting plane beneath to confine the particle
in a finite region of space. The neutron was used as the quantum
particle since it is charge less and hence indifferent to the
electromagnetic noise. The experiment was found to be in excellent
agreement with the theoretical computations.

Here we set the model in a planar noncommutative phase space background
to determine the effects of noncommutativity on the energy spectrum. We
use the WKB approximation to analyze the problem analytically. Finally
the experimental findings of [ 81 , 82 , 83 ] are used to put an upper
bound on the noncommutative parameters. The numerical analysis of a
similar model was given in [ 84 ] . In that paper the model was defined
on the commutative space and exploiting an inverse phase space
transformation it was expressed in terms of the noncommuting variables.
A perturbative expansion of the Hamiltonian was then carried out to find
the energy correction numerically. Here our results are obtained by
using analytical computations and these agree with [ 84 ] . The study of
this problem from other perspectives may be found in [ 85 , 86 ]

In section 3.1 we define the noncommutative space and give a general
phase space transformation to connect the noncommutative space variables
and the commutative counterparts. In the next section we discuss the
position space and momentum space representation of the noncommutative
algebra. In section 3.3 the quantum gravitational well is introduced.
After summarizing the theoretical and experimental [ 83 ] results of the
energy spectrum in usual commutative space, we define the corresponding
Hamiltonian in noncommutative space. The structure of this Hamiltonian
is explicitly obtained in both noncommutative and commutative
descriptions, leading to completely equivalent results. In section 3.4
the energy spectrum is computed by using the WKB approximation. An upper
bound on the noncommutative parameter is derived by comparing with the
recent experimental results given in [ 83 ] . Finally some remarks are
given in section 3.5.

### 3.1 Noncommutative phase space

We consider a planar phase space, where the standard Heisenberg algebra
is obeyed

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

This algebra is invariant under the following symmetry transformation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now we define two operators @xmath and @xmath in the following way

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
     @xmath      (3.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath are arbitrary constants. Here we enforce a symmetry leading
to @xmath and @xmath under the transformation ( 3.2 ). Clearly this is
possible if we introduce the following transformation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.5)
     @xmath      (3.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus a symmetry transformation, analogous to ( 3.2 ), in the modified
@xmath plane is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

Using ( 3.1 ) we can show that the new coordinates @xmath and momenta
@xmath satisfy the algebra

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.8)
     @xmath      (3.9)
     @xmath      (3.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

Under the symmetry transformation ( 3.7 ) the above algebra is
invariant.

So far we did not associate any specific values to the coefficients
@xmath and @xmath ’s. Now if we set

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

which reproduces the noncommutative structure given in [ 84 ] . The term
@xmath is interpreted [ 84 ] as a correction to the Planck constant.
However by taking the following values of @xmath and @xmath one can keep
the Planck constant unchanged:

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

which yields the noncommutative algebra

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

so that the Planck constant is not modified. Physical applications of
this type of noncommutative algebra may be found in [ 68 ] .

The inverse phase space transformation is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (3.15)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- --------

Observe that @xmath and @xmath must have different signs so that the
various coefficients are real and well defined which guarantees the
hermitian nature of physical operators @xmath and @xmath .

### 3.2 Representation of the algebra

The differential representation of the Heisenberg algebra is easy to
find. In a coordinate space representation, @xmath are diagonal and
@xmath and in a momentum space description, the momenta @xmath are
diagonal while @xmath . In order to find a differential representation
of the noncommutative algebra ( 3.13 ), we consider a general
representation of the form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are dimensionless constants. Now consistency
with algebra ( 3.13 ) demands

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since three equations are not sufficient to fix all the parameters, we
find the solutions in terms of @xmath to obtain the following
representation of the phase space variables

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

This representation should have a smooth commutative limit when @xmath .
The natural choice @xmath does not satisfy this condition. On the other
hand if we take @xmath then the representation,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.19)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

has a smooth limit, which is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

Noting that the algebra ( 3.13 ) is invariant under the transformation
@xmath , we can make this transformation in ( 3.19 ) to get the momentum
space representation.

### 3.3 Gravitational well

Before discussing the problem in the noncommutative space setting we
first study it in usual commutative space. We consider a two dimensional
plane where a particle of mass @xmath is subjected to the Earth’s
gravitational field in one direction; the vertical, taken to be
described by the coordinate @xmath . We assume that the gravitational
acceleration @xmath is constant near the surface of the earth. The
commutative Hamiltonian is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since the particle is free in the @xmath direction, its energy spectrum
is continuous in that direction and the wave function can be written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the other direction the wave function is the well known Airy function
@xmath with appropriate normalization [ 87 ] ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

The zeroes of the Airy function, @xmath give the energy eigenvalues

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

Below the classical turning point @xmath the wave function oscillates
and above @xmath it decays exponentially. This was observed
experimentally by Nesvizhevsky et al. [ 81 , 82 ] . They used neutron as
the quantum particle because of its charge neutrality and long life time
( @xmath s) [ 88 ] . They allowed the particles to fall towards a
horizontal mirror which, combined with the gravitational field forms the
potential well. By placing an absorber above the mirror they allow a
cold neutron beam to flow with a horizontal velocity @xmath . Then they
measure the number of transmitted neutrons as a function of absorber
height: this was shown to be a step like function which establishes the
quantum nature of the problem.

The energy levels are also written below simply by the WKB approximation
where the error is @xmath compared to the results derived from ( 3.24 ).

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.25)
              @xmath   @xmath      (3.26)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.27)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

A summary of both theoretical and experimental results is given. Taking
the values of constants as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.28)
     @xmath      (3.29)
     @xmath      (3.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

the first two energy levels found from ( 3.25 ) are,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.31)
     @xmath      (3.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

From @xmath and @xmath the classical turning points are calculated to be

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.33)
     @xmath      (3.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

These are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results [ 83 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.35)
     @xmath      (3.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

Error bars for the above mentioned energy levels are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.37)
     @xmath      (3.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

#### 3.3.1 Noncommutative space description

In the noncommutative space ( 3.13 ) the analogue of the Hamiltonian (
3.21 ) is defined as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

To find the spectrum, two approaches are possible. One can directly work
in the noncommutative space variables or use the phase space
transformations to reduce the problem on the usual commutative space. We
first discuss the second approach. Using the maps ( 3.3 , 3.4 ) together
with the parametrization ( 3.12 ), we find,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.40)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Defining a new constant

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

and a new variable

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

we can write the above Hamiltonian in the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.43)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Since the difference between @xmath and @xmath is just a constant, they
satisfy the same commutation relations. The eigenvalues of @xmath are
translated by an equal amount vis a vis those for @xmath and hence these
are not distinguished. Also neglecting the additive constant in the
Hamiltonian ( 3.43 ) we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.44)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Now we define a modified gravitational acceleration @xmath in the
following way

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.45)
     @xmath      (3.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

The tilting angle with the @xmath axis is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

while,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since the product @xmath is negative, @xmath is always positive
definite. Now we rotate in the @xmath plane by an angle @xmath , so that
the coordinate of a point in the rotated frame is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

Correspondingly, the momenta are transformed :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using ( 3.49 ) and ( 3.50 ) it is easy to show that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.51)
     @xmath      (3.52)
     @xmath      (3.53)
     @xmath      (3.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

We use the operator versions of ( 3.51 , 3.52 , 3.53 , 3.54 ) to write
the noncommutative Hamiltonian in the rotated frame as,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.55)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The primed and unprimed variables satisfy the same algebra; henceforth
the primes are all dropped. Then we can identify the first three terms
of the Hamiltonian ( 3.55 ) exactly as the commutative Hamiltonian given
in ( 3.21 ). This should be considered as the unperturbed Hamiltonian.
The term @xmath is effectively a Landau problem like term, where a
magnetic field is present perpendicular to the @xmath plane. The term
@xmath is practically an oscillating potential.

Since the noncommutative effects are rather small we first confine to
the leading order approximation in @xmath and @xmath . Moreover ( 3.48 )
shows that in the leading order,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

Hence the Hamiltonian ( 3.55 ) in the first order approximation is given
by,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.57)
              @xmath   @xmath      (3.58)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is nothing but the commutative Hamiltonian already given in
( 3.21 ). The energy spectrum pertaining to this Hamiltonian will be
computed in section 3.4.

#### 3.3.2 Alternative formulation

Here we analyze the structure of the Hamiltonian directly in terms of
the noncommuting space variables.

Using the representation ( 3.19 ), this Hamiltonian can be written in
the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Making use of the formula @xmath for small (compared to unity) @xmath ,
we simplify the Hamiltonian to get

  -- -------- -------- -- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath               (3.59)
                          @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -- -------- --------

Keeping terms only upto first order in the noncommutative parameters,
this further reduces to

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.60)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath does not appear in the leading order expression of the
Hamiltonian, we drop it from the algebra ( 3.13 ). In that case @xmath
and @xmath are nothing but the canonical pairs of ordinary quantum
mechanics and ( 3.60 ) is identified with ( 3.58 ).

### 3.4 Bounds on noncommutative parameters

Here the energy spectrum is computed and therefrom bounds on the
noncommutative parameters are determined. Consider the Hamiltonian (
3.58 ) in the first order approximation. Now the term proportional to
@xmath in the above Hamiltonian can be treated perturbatively. The
unperturbed part @xmath is known to be exactly solvable in terms of Airy
functions [ 87 ] . Furthermore, using the property that Airy function
(or any bound state wave function vis a vis motion in the direction
@xmath ) is real, it is easily seen that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

This can also be understood physically from the fact that, for a bound
state system, the average current flow in a particular direction is
zero. So effectively the Hamiltonian turns out to be

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

In this way we see that, in the leading order, the noncommutative
corrections are entirely encoded in the term

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

We write the complete Hamiltonian ( 3.62 ) in the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.64)
              @xmath   @xmath      (3.65)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where @xmath . Since in the @xmath direction the particle is free,
@xmath is a constant of motion. In the experiment painstakingly
performed by Nesvizhevsky et al. [ 81 , 82 ] the expectation value of
@xmath was

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now we can use ( 3.26 ) to write the corrected energy values of the
Hamiltonian ( 3.64 ) as,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.67)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where @xmath corresponds to the unperturbed energy and @xmath is the
correction. It is possible to find an analytic expression for @xmath
from ( 3.67 ) by an expansion,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

Retaining the leading @xmath -order term we find,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.69)
  -- -------- -- --------

The same functional form can be obtained from the virial theorem [ 89 ]
.

Taking the values of @xmath and @xmath from ( 3.31 , 3.32 ) and @xmath
from ( 3.66 ) we get on using ( 3.69 ),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.70)
     @xmath      (3.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

Finally, using the experimental input from ( 3.37 , 3.38 ) leads to the
following upper bounds on @xmath ;

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (3.72)
     @xmath      (3.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

The upper bound on @xmath ( 3.72 , 3.73 ) are in excellent agreement
with the numerical results obtained in [ 84 ] by perturbing about the
exact Airy function solutions.

### 3.5 Discussion

We have studied a model of a particle in the quantum well of the Earth’s
gravitational field and a perfectly reflecting horizontal plane beneath,
defined in a space with noncommuting coordinates and momenta. By
considering a phase space transformation we reduced the problem on the
commutative space. We have shown that in this process it is not
necessary to modify the Planck constant as is generally believed [ 84 ,
90 ] . The commutative space Hamiltonian was found to be indifferent to
the @xmath (i. e. coordinate) noncommutativity in the leading order. The
energy spectrum in this model was computed analytically by exploiting
the WKB approximation. Comparison with the experimental findings of [ 81
, 82 , 83 ] placed an upper bound on the @xmath - noncommutativity
parameter appearing in the algebra of momenta.

## Chapter 4 Deformed symmetry in noncommutative spaces

So far we were discussing two dimensional noncommutativity which is
known to satisfy some special properties. In fact in the previous
chapter rotational symmetry was used extensively to simplify the
Hamiltonian, but that symmetry does not hold for an arbitrary dimension.
To see this we take the following general structure for arbitrary
n-dimensions,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

Under coordinate rotations @xmath with @xmath , infinitesimal version of
( 4.1 ) gives

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

This is not true in general. But for @xmath , @xmath and @xmath under
which the above condition holds. Thus two dimensional noncommutativity
is restricted in some sense. So to study deformed symmetries we take a
general noncommutative relation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the phase space is spanned by the variables ( @xmath ).

There are some important issues related with the application of ( 4.3 ).
In relativistic theory, even a constant @xmath breaks Poincar @xmath
symmetries [ 91 , 92 ] . Likewise for massless models, conformal
symmetries are affected. However it might be possible to introduce
quantum deformations of the generators such that the particular form of
the commutator algebra remains covariant. This has been discussed in
great detail, for a constant @xmath , using either higher order
differential operators [ 31 , 48 , 93 , 94 , 95 ] or twist functions
following from quantum group arguments [ 30 , 96 ] . In this chapter we
study deformed symmetries of two important noncommutative spaces. First
one is the nonrelativistic constant @xmath noncommutativity

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

and the other one is the Snyder algebra

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a measure of the noncommutativity. This is an example of
relativistic nonconstant noncommutativity. Other cases like
nonrelativistic nonconstant noncommutativity (an example of which is Lie
algebraic noncomutativity which has been analyzed in [ 97 ] ) are not
discussed here

In the first part of this chapter we exploit the results of [ 94 ] to
write the deformed Schrödinger generators which satisfy the standard
algebra. These are used to get the deformed transformations. We also
construct a non relativistic model which generates the algebra ( 4.4 )
and is invariant under the deformed transformations. The Nöther theorem
is then used to get back the deformed generators form this model. This
shows the self consistency.

In the second part, a deformed translation is defined under which Snyder
algebra remains covariant. Next, a dynamical model invariant under such
deformation is formulated. Using Dirac’s [ 69 ] constraint analysis the
deformed brackets are computed which yield Snyder brackets. We therefore
provide a dynamical realization of the algebra ( 4.5 ). Nöther’s theorem
is then used to find the deformed generators from the dynamical model.
The algebraic map between the variables of Snyder algebra and the
standard commutative algebra is obtained. Finally, the analysis is
extended to the conformal sector.

### 4.1 Deformed Schrödinger symmetry and transformations

The generators of the Schrödinger group consists of rotations ( @xmath
), translations ( @xmath ), boosts ( @xmath ), dilatations ( @xmath )
and special conformal transformations ( @xmath ). The standard
representation of these generators are given by,

  -- -- -------- -- -------
        @xmath      
        @xmath      
        @xmath      (4.6)
        @xmath      
        @xmath      
  -- -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the mass of the particle. The complete set of algebra,
satisfied by these generators in a commutative space

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

is found to be,

  -- -- -------- -------- -- -------
        @xmath               
        @xmath   @xmath      
                             
        @xmath               
        @xmath   @xmath      
        @xmath   @xmath      
        @xmath   @xmath      
                             (4.8)
  -- -- -------- -------- -- -------

Now in the noncommutative space ( 4.4 ), one has to appropriately modify
the expressions of generators so that they satisfy the standard algebra
( 4.8 ). Taking general forms of these generators from dimensional
arguments, it has been shown in [ 94 ] that consistency with ( 4.8 ) and
various Jacobi identities fixes the deformed representation of the
generators. These are given by,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (4.9)
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- -------

It can be easily verified that in the noncommutative space ( 4.4 ) the
deformed generators ( 4.9 ) satisfy the undeformed algebra ( 4.8 ).
Expectedly, in the limit @xmath ( 4.9 ) reduces to the undeformed
generators ( 4.6 ) under the identification @xmath .

It is possible to give a map which connect the deformed generators ( 4.9
) with the undeformed generators ( 4.6 ). The maps between the
noncommutative variables ( @xmath ) and the commutative variable (
@xmath ) are given by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (4.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The noncommutative phase space algebra ( 4.4 ) and the Heisenberg
algebra ( 4.7 ) are consistent with the above map.

Knowing the expressions of deformed generators ( 4.9 ) it is
straightforward to obtain the deformed transformation rules. These are
obtained from the general relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the generator. Thus for translation generator @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.12)
     @xmath      (4.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

For rotation generator @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.14)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.15)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

For the Galilean boost @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.16)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.17)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

For the dilatation generator @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.18)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.19)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

For the expansion @xmath

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.20)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.21)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

These are the complete expressions of the deformed transformation rules
which keep the noncommutative algebra ( 4.4 ) invariant.

### 4.2 Construction of a dynamical model

In order to construct a model which will generate the noncommutative
algebra ( 4.4 ) in a natural manner we take the following non
relativistic action for a free particle of mass m

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

and use the classical version of the transformation ( 4.10 ) to get the
following form of the action,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

This model in @xmath dimension has been studied in [ 98 ] . Discussions
on the relativistic generalization of ( 4.23 ) are given in [ 99 , 100 ]
. The action ( 4.23 ) shows some interesting properties which we study
now. Interpreting @xmath and @xmath of the above first order action as
the configuration space variables, the canonical momenta conjugate to
@xmath and @xmath are written as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

Thus we get the primary constraints

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

which satisfy the following Poisson algebra

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

These are second class constraints which can be eliminated by the use of
Dirac brackets. The first step is to construct the constraint matrix

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

We write the inverse of @xmath as @xmath such that @xmath . It is given
by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

Dirac brackets can now be calculated from the definition ( 2.32 ). For
the action ( 4.22 ), the configuration space variables satisfy the
following algebra

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (4.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

This algebra is the classical version of the noncommutative commutator
algebra ( 4.4 ). Though there is no noncommutativity in the momentum (
@xmath ) sector it is possible to construct an action from ( 4.23 )
which will generate the momentum noncommutativity. We show it in the
following way.

The equations of motion for the action ( 4.23 ) are given by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.30)
     @xmath      (4.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

Combining above two equations one obtains @xmath which is used in ( 4.23
) to write the action in terms of @xmath alone

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

The two dimensional version of the above action has been studied
thoroughly in [ 57 ] . As the Lagrangian contains second order
derivative, we introduce two sets of momenta [ 57 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.33)
     @xmath      (4.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

The non zero Poisson bracket exists only for canonical pairs

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

All other brackets are zero. The second set of momenta ( 4.34 ) forms
the primary constraints for the model ( 4.32 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

which satisfy the following constraint algebra

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

Having obtained the constraint matrix we can calculate various Dirac
brackets from the formula

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

Interestingly the second set of momenta are now noncommutative. The
algebra we obtain is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

Other Dirac brackets are obtained easily from ( 4.38 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.40)
     @xmath      (4.41)
     @xmath      (4.42)
     @xmath      (4.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

This shows the dual nature of position and momenta noncommutativity.

### 4.3 Nöther’s theorem and generators

It is possible to reproduce the deformed Schrödinger generators from a
Nöther analysis of ( 4.23 ). This shows the consistency between the
dynamical approach of section 4.2 and the algebraic approach of section
4.1.

In general, the invariance of an action @xmath under an infinitesimal
symmetry transformation,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the generator of the transformation and @xmath is the
canonical momenta conjugate to @xmath . If the quantity inside the
parentheses is denoted by @xmath , then the generator is defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

For the model ( 4.23 ) both @xmath are interpreted as configuration
space variables so that,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is simplified using the expressions ( 4.24 ) to get,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

This relation is now used to find the deformed generators knowing the
deformed transformation rules. For example we consider the Galilean
boost. Using ( 4.48 ) and the deformed transformations ( 4.16 , 4.17 )
we write

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now in order to calculate the variation of the Lagrangian( 4.23 ) we use
( 4.16 , 4.17 ) to obtain the following results

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.50)
     @xmath      (4.51)
     @xmath      (4.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using these expressions we find the variation of the Lagrangian

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

Extracting @xmath from the above equation we put it in ( 4.49 ) to get
the deformed generator

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is same as the boost generator given in ( 4.9 ) without the
parameter @xmath . The other deformed generators obtained in this manner
are identical with ( 4.9 ).

### 4.4 The Snyder space and its symmetries

The study of deformed symmetries, presented in the previous sections can
be done for other cases. A simple generalization is to take the
relativistic version of ( 4.4 ) and study deformed Poincare-conformal
symmetry. This has been analyzed extensively in [ 101 ] . Instead we
study the Snyder [ 8 ] algebra( 4.5 ). It was originally obtained by a
dimensional descent from five dimensions and involves the angular
momentum in the algebra of the non commuting coordinates. Taking the
momentum operators commuting, as in the usual space, naturally leads to
a deformed algebra among @xmath , therefore ensuring the validity of the
various Jacobi identities. It leads to a discrete space time compatible
with Lorentz symmetry. Apart from its intrinsic interest this algebra
has relevance in various contexts. For instance, a similar algebra is
also obtained from quantum gravity in @xmath dimensions [ 102 ] . There
also exists a mapping between the Snyder space and @xmath -Minkowski
space-time [ 103 ] which is frequently used in analyzing doubly special
relativity.

We now study the different symmetries associated with the Snyder
Algebra( 4.5 ).

#### 4.4.1 Lorentz symmetry

By its very construction the algebra ( 4.5 ) is compatible with standard
Lorentz transformations,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.55)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.56)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

with @xmath . This is checked in the following way. Consider the
variation in the first relation,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.57)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The same expression is obtained by considering the variation on the
r.h.s of that relation,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.58)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

An identical treatment follows for the other two relations. This is
sufficient to ensure consistency of the Lorentz transformations.
Expectedly, the generator retains its primitive (undeformed) structure,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

so that,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

and similarly for @xmath .

#### 4.4.2 Translation symmetry

The commutative space transformation rules for translation @xmath are
not compatible with the first relation in the Snyder algebra. So we take
the following general expressions of @xmath and @xmath which are
dimensionally consistent

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.61)
     @xmath      (4.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

Compatibility with the Snyder algebra fixes @xmath and @xmath . So the
deformed transformation rule for the translation operator in Snyder
space is given by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.63)
     @xmath      (4.64)
  -- -------- -- --------

Although we have a deformed transformation rule for translation, the
generator remains the same as in the commutative space. To emphasize
this point we note that

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.65)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

and likewise for @xmath .

Thus the Poincare generators in Snyder space and usual commutative space
are form invariant. However, whereas Lorentz transformation remains
undeformed, translation get deformed.

Finally, in spite of the involved algebra ( 4.5 ) these generators
satisfy the usual Poincare algebra,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

### 4.5 Dynamical model invariant under deformation and the Snyder
algebra

Here we discuss a method by which a dynamical model is constructed to
reproduce the Snyder algebra ( 4.5 ) from the constraint analysis of the
model. Several authors [ 104 , 105 , 106 , 107 ] have suggested various
models leading to this algebra but those results were obtained in a
specific gauge. In our analysis we do not fix any gauge. Instead, we
calculate the Dirac brackets of the configuration space variables of a
dynamical model which is invariant under the deformed (translation)
symmetry. The results lead to the Snyder algebra.

Consider the following first order form of the action for a relativistic
free particle of mass @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a Lagrange multiplier enforcing the Einstein condition
@xmath .

Since the Lorentz transformation is undeformed, obviously ( 4.67 )
remains invariant. Under translation however,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.68)
              @xmath   @xmath      (4.69)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

obtained on exploiting ( 4.63 ), ( 4.64 ). The additional symmetry
breaking term can be written as,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.70)
              @xmath   @xmath      (4.71)
              @xmath   @xmath      (4.72)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where recursive use of ( 4.63 ) and ( 4.64 ) has been done. Thus
inclusion of the term @xmath in the action ( 4.67 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

makes it quasi-invariant under deformed translations,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.74)
  -- -------- -- --------

and invariant under Lorentz transformation.

We interpret @xmath and @xmath of the first order action ( 4.73 ) as the
configuration variables in an extended space. The canonical momentum
conjugate to @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are denoted by @xmath . They do
not contain the velocity term and hence are interpreted as primary
constraints. These are given by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.75)
     @xmath      (4.76)
     @xmath      (4.77)
  -- -------- -- --------

The non vanishing Poisson brackets of the constraints are given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.78)
     @xmath      (4.79)
  -- -------- -- --------

All other brackets are zero. The canonical Hamiltonian of the system is
read off from the first order action ( 4.73 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.80)
  -- -------- -- --------

The total Hamiltonian is given by the sum of canonical Hamiltonian and
the primary constraints with Lagrange multipliers

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.81)
  -- -------- -- --------

Time consistency of the constraint ( 4.75 ) leads to the following
secondary constraint

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.82)
  -- -------- -- --------

In order to eliminate the second class constraint sector @xmath by the
use of Dirac brackets we follow the same method discussed in section
2.2. The inverse constraint matrix,

  -- -- -- --------
           (4.83)
  -- -- -- --------

leads to the following Dirac brackets among the configuration space
variables

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.84)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is straight forward to elevate this algebra at the operator level.
Since @xmath s commute among themselves there is no problem in the
algebra between @xmath and @xmath . Furthermore from the last algebra it
is clear that @xmath is symmetrical in @xmath . Since the bracket
between @xmath and @xmath should be antisymmetric in @xmath no ordering
problem appears. Thus without any ambiguity the Dirac brackets ( 4.84 )
get lifted to the commutators ( 4.5 ).

Since the secondary constraint @xmath has vanishing Dirac brackets with
all constraints,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.85)
     @xmath      (4.86)
  -- -------- -- --------

it is first class in nature and generates the gauge (reparametrisation)
transformations. The momenta @xmath canonically conjugate to the
Lagrange multiplier @xmath is not physically important.

### 4.6 Translation and rotation generators from Nöther’s theorem

In this section we reproduce the deformed translation and rotation
generator from a Nöther analysis. For the model ( 4.73 ) the generator
is written from ( 4.46 ) as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.87)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are both interpreted as configuration space
variables. Using the constraints ( 4.76 ), ( 4.77 ), the expression (
4.87 ) is further simplified to yield,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.88)
  -- -------- -- --------

Translations :
For translations we get from ( 4.64 ) and ( 4.74 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.89)
  -- -------- -- --------

which when substituted in ( 4.88 ) gives the translation generator

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.90)
  -- -------- -- --------

Rotations :
Under rotation the Lagrangian itself is manifestly invariant ( @xmath ).
Hence using ( 4.56 ) we get,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.91)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is the cherished expression.

### 4.7 Mapping between deformed and usual symmetries

We give an algebraic map between the commutative and noncommutative
variables by comparing the actions ( 4.67 ) and ( 4.73 ). At first (
4.67 ) is rewritten in terms of the commutative space variables @xmath
(this is just a change in nomenclature)

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.92)
  -- -------- -- --------

with,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.93)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then the actions ( 4.92 ) and ( 4.73 ) are mapped by the
transformations,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.94)
     @xmath      (4.95)
  -- -------- -- --------

The inverse map is given by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.96)
     @xmath      (4.97)
  -- -------- -- --------

The classical Snyder algebra follows from the above relations by using
the canonical algebra ( 4.93 ),

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.98)
              @xmath   @xmath      (4.99)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

and likewise for the other brackets.

It is feasible to construct an operator analogue of the maps ( 4.94 ), (
4.95 ) by giving an ordering prescription. Using the Weyl (symmetric)
ordering, we get,

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
     @xmath                     
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The inverse transformation is found to be,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.101)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is just the Weyl ordered form of ( 4.96 ), ( 4.97 ).

A slightly lengthy computation reveals that the quantum Snyder algebra (
4.5 ) as a commutator algebra. This follows from ( 4.101 ) by using the
standard canonical commutators involving @xmath and @xmath .

### 4.8 Deformed conformal symmetry

In order to study the deformed symmetry associated with the dilatation
and the special conformal transformation we first give an algebraic
analysis followed by a dynamical treatment related to the action ( 4.73
).

#### 4.8.1 Dilatation symmetry

Under the usual transformations for dilatation @xmath , covariance of
only the last relation in ( 4.5 ) is preserved. Thus as an ansatz, we
take

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.102)
     @xmath      (4.103)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The covariance of the second relation in ( 4.5 ) under ( 4.103 ) yields,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.104)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Up to an ordering ambiguity a solution for @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.105)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Requiring covariance of the @xmath bracket in ( 4.5 ), this ambiguity is
fixed. It leads to the transformation law,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.106)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The dilatation generator yielding the deformed transformations is given
by,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.107)
  -- -------- -- ---------

In the limit @xmath , it reduces to the standard expression.

It is straightforward to check that although @xmath in ( 4.107 ) is
deformed, the corresponding algebra of generators remains the same

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.108)
     @xmath      (4.109)
     @xmath      (4.110)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Generator from Nöther’s theorem :

We take the massless form of ( 4.73 ),

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.111)
  -- -------- -- ---------

to study its invariance under the classical version of the deformed
dilatation transformations ( 4.102 , 4.106 ).

The total variation of the Lagrangian

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.112)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

cannot be expressed as a total time derivative. However on the
constraint shell ( @xmath ), invariance is achieved, @xmath .

Using ( 4.88 ), the variation ( 4.102 ) and @xmath (since @xmath ), we
obtain,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.113)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

It is possible to construct the operator analogue of the above generator
by following the Weyl ordered prescription,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.114)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The last two terms combine to give the first two terms so that the final
expression exactly agrees with ( 4.107 ).

#### 4.8.2 Special conformal symmetry

In order to discuss the deformed special conformal transformations we
adopt a classical treatment. Making use of the transformations ( 4.94 ),
( 4.95 ) we construct the deformed generator from the usual expression.
After getting the deformed generator, covariance of the Snyder algebra
is shown.

In the ordinary commutative space the generator for the special
conformal transformation is given by,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.115)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using ( 4.94 ), ( 4.95 ) the deformed generator is obtained

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.116)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

The transformation rules for the deformed conformal transformation are
given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.118)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.119)
              @xmath   @xmath            (4.120)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

These deformed conformal transformations have a smooth limit @xmath in
which they reduce to the familiar structures in commutative space. From
these transformations it is found that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (4.121)
  -- -------- -- ---------

This is sufficient to prove the compatibility of the deformed
transformation laws with the classical Snyder algebra, manifested in the
form of Dirac brackets ( 4.84 )
Generator from Nöther’s theorem :
We first calculate the variation of the individual pieces in the action
( 4.111 )

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
                       @xmath      
                       @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.122)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Some terms are expressible as a total time derivative which are retained
since these will be useful in obtaining the generator. Terms not
expressible in this way drop out due to the mass shell constraint @xmath
. Combining all terms, we obtain,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.123)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is given in ( 4.116 ).

The variation @xmath is obtained from ( 4.120 ) while B is abstracted
from ( 4.123 ). From the definition ( 4.88 ) we find,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.124)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

thereby reproducing the desired definition of the deformed generator
given in ( 4.116 ).

### 4.9 Discussion

Deformed Schrödinger symmetry for nonrelativistic constant
noncommutativity and deformed conformal-Poincar @xmath symmetries for
relativistic Snyder type noncommutativity have been studied in this
chapter. The method, we followed here is quite general and can be
applied in other noncommutative spaces. We also constructed dynamical
models invariant under the deformed symmetries. Using Dirac’s constraint
analysis, we obtain the noncommutative algebras (both constant and
Snyder type) from the respective dynamical models. It is noteworthy that
we did not fix any gauge to get the algebra. In this sense our method is
different from some other approaches where gauge fixing was mandatory.
In addition, for constant noncommutativity we have analyzed a Lagrangian
involving second order time derivative. This reproduced momentum
noncommutativity. Maps between the variables of commutative and
noncommutative algebra are also given. Finally, we use the Nöther’s
theorem to derive the deformed generators from the dynamical models.
These are shown to be identical with the deformed generators obtained
from the algebraic approach.

As a future prospect we could develop a differential calculus involving
higher order derivatives to find the differential representations of the
deformed generators. The modified coproduct rule and the associated Hopf
algebra can then be obtained. However the algebra of these deformed
generators should remain same as the usual undeformed one.

## Chapter 5 Noncommutative gauge theory: Lagrangian analysis

In order to construct field theory on a noncommutative space there are
two approaches. In one approach fields are treated as operators in some
Hilbert space. In the other method fields are taken as some functions of
commutative space variables and noncommutativity among these variables
is introduced by an appropriate star ( @xmath ) product [ 108 ] . In
this chapter we follow the second approach where a noncommutative
Lagrangian and its equations of motion consist of ordinary fields and
their derivatives with the replacement of ordinary product by the @xmath
product. Introduction of gauge symmetry in noncommutative field theory
is also possible. Recent analysis [ 43 , 44 , 45 , 49 , 109 , 110 ]
reveals that it can be done in two different ways. In one approach star
deformed gauge transformations are taken, keeping the comultiplication
(Leibniz) rule unchanged and in the other approach gauge transformations
are taken as in the commutative case at the expense of a modified
Leibniz rule.

While both approaches preserve gauge invariance of the action, an
important distinction between these two approaches has been mentioned in
[ 45 , 46 , 49 ] . In the case of star gauge transformations, gauge
symmetries act only on the fields in a similar way as in theories on
commutative space time. Star gauge symmetry can thus be interpreted as a
physical symmetry in the usual sense. On the other hand if ordinary
gauge transformations with a twisted Leibniz rule is taken, then the
transformations do not act only on the fields. Consequently it is not a
physical symmetry in the conventional sense and it is obscure whether
Nöther charges and Ward identities can be derived.

In this chapter both these approaches are studied within a common
Lagrangian framework. To do this we recall that Lagrangian analysis of
gauge symmetries for commutative space theories has been discussed using
certain gauge identities [ 111 ] . These gauge identities involve the
Euler derivatives and the generators of gauge transformations. This type
of analysis has been applied in various contexts [ 112 , 113 , 114 ] .

In this chapter we first briefly discuss the general formulation with
the Einstein-Hilbert action as an example. Then the analysis is used for
the noncommutative non-Abelian gauge theory. Both the approaches are
considered. In the first case, gauge generators, obtained from the gauge
identity are found to be star deformation of the commutative space
relations. In the other approach generators of the undeformed gauge
transformations are shown to be similar with the commutative space
relations. Furthermore, we find that the relation connecting the gauge
generator with the gauge identity (which is form invariant under the
star and twisted gauge transformations) is neither the undeformed result
nor its star deformation, as obtained in the previous treatment. Rather,
it is a twisted form of the conventional (undeformed) result.

### 5.1 General formulation

To study the dynamics of a field from an action principle we consider a
general Lagrangian involving only upto first order derivatives of the
field of the form ¹ ¹ 1 We use the notation @xmath for the four vector
@xmath . ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath denotes the number of fields. Also, it contains all other
(e. g. symmetry) indices relevant for the problem. An arbitrary
variation of this action is written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

The equations of motion are obtained by setting the Euler derivative
@xmath to be zero,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now we vary the field @xmath in the following way

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath and @xmath being the parameter and generator respectively,
of the transformation. Under this variation of the field, the variation
of the action is written from ( 5.2 ) as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.5)
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

We define a quantity [ 111 , 112 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

to write ( 5.5 ) in a compact form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

If the action remains unchanged ( @xmath ) under the field
transformation ( 5.4 ) then it implies,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

The last equality, which is called the gauge identity, must be true
without use of any equation of motion. The expression ( 5.4 ) defines
the gauge transformations of the fields with @xmath being the generator
of gauge transformation.
Diffeomorphism symmetry as an example :
Now we use the general analysis to study the diffeomorphism symmetry of
the general theory of relativity. We start from the gauge identity and
compute the generators @xmath from ( 5.6 ). Then we obtain the explicit
structure of the diffeomorphism transformation of the metric from ( 5.4
).

The Einstein-Hilbert action is given by,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.9)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where @xmath is the Ricci tensor

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The definition of the Christoffel connection in terms of the metric
components,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

comes from the metric compatibility condition

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

Varying the action ( 5.9 ) with respect to the metric @xmath we get the
Euler derivative @xmath i. e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the explicit form of @xmath is written as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

leading to the usual Einstein’s equation, @xmath . Now to find the gauge
identity we recall the Bianchi identity [ 115 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the Riemann tensor is defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

Contracting @xmath with @xmath and @xmath with @xmath , in the above
identity, using ( 5.12 ) we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is referred as the gauge identity [ 116 ] . Since the Euler
derivative we defined in ( 5.14 ) is not @xmath but @xmath we take our
gauge identity as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

The extra factor 2 is introduced for later convenience. In order to
write the above equation ( 5.18 ) in a more convenient way we note that
the definition of @xmath ( 5.11 ) can be used to write the divergence of
Einstein tensor

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

in the following form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now using ( 5.12 ) and ( 5.20 ) we write the gauge identity ( 5.18 ) as,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.21)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where we have used the important relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the metric formulation of gravity, ( 5.6 ) is rewritten as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

Comparing this equation with the identity ( 5.21 ), the generators are
obtained. The expression for the nonvanishing generators are given below

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.24)
     @xmath      (5.25)
     @xmath      (5.26)
     @xmath      (5.27)
     @xmath      (5.28)
     @xmath      (5.29)
     @xmath      (5.30)
     @xmath      (5.31)
     @xmath      (5.32)
     @xmath      (5.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

We now calculate the diffeomorphism transformation of the metric @xmath
from ( 5.4 ). It is first rewritten as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using the generators ( 5.24 – 5.33 ) in the above expression, the
diffeomorphism law is obtained

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

This can be written in the covariant notation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

The above result expresses the diffeomorphism transformation of the
metric field @xmath . It can also be obtained from the first order
formulation of general relativity (Palatini formulation) for which our
general formulation is applicable.

### 5.2 Noncommutative gauge theory

We consider a noncommutative space, where the coordinates @xmath satisfy
the following canonical relation ² ² 2 From now we shall denote the
noncommutative coordinates by @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is a constant antisymmetric matrix. The noncommutative
coordinates satisfying ( 5.37 ) are the generators of an associative
algebra @xmath [ 40 , 41 , 42 ] . According to the Weyl correspondence,
we can associate an element of @xmath ( @xmath )with a function ( @xmath
) of classical variables @xmath [ 117 ] by the unique prescription

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Fourier transform of @xmath .

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

New operators can be obtained by multiplication of @xmath ’s defined in
( 5.38 ). The classical function corresponding to this new operator is
denoted by @xmath . So the requirement @xmath is written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

The product of two exponentials in the integral is obtained by the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.41)
  -- -------- -- --------

to write ( 5.40 ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

Comparing the above equation with ( 5.38 ) we get the expression for
@xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

@xmath can now be read off from ( 5.39 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is the Moyal–Weyl @xmath product [ 13 ] . Star product of functions
within an integral satisfy the well known property

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

and the trace like property,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

Noncommutative action and the gauge transformations :
Inserting the @xmath product in place of the ordinary product we
construct the noncommutative free Dirac action in four dimension

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

To introduce the connection, the commutative covariant derivative

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.48)
  -- -------- -- --------

is replaced by the noncommutative covariant derivative

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.49)
  -- -------- -- --------

This leads to the field strength tensor

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

with

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here the star commutator is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

The gauge field defined in this way is coupled with the Dirac field to
give the complete action for the noncommutative non-Abelian theory

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.53)
  -- -------- -- --------

The action ( 5.53 ) is invariant under both deformed gauge
transformations,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.54)
     @xmath      (5.55)
     @xmath      (5.56)
     @xmath      (5.57)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the usual Leibniz rule,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

as well as the undeformed gauge transformations

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.59)
     @xmath      (5.60)
     @xmath      (5.61)
     @xmath      (5.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

with the twisted Leibniz rule [ 43 , 44 , 109 ] ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.63)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

For deformed gauge symmetry ( 5.54 – 5.58 ), it is obvious from the
definition of the field strength tensor ( 5.51 ) and the gauge
transformations ( 5.54 ) that, in general, both @xmath as well as @xmath
are enveloping algebra valued for deformed gauge symmetry. For the case
of twisted gauge symmetry ( 5.59 – 5.62 , 5.63 ), however, one has to
consider the equation of motion derived later (see ( 5.71 )),
interpreted as equations for the gauge field @xmath , to conclude that
here also @xmath is enveloping algebra valued. The field tensor @xmath ,
by its very definition ( 5.51 ), is of course enveloping algebra valued.
Thus, in both treatments of gauge symmetry, @xmath and @xmath are
enveloping algebra valued [ 109 ] . This implies that the gauge
potential @xmath has to be expanded over a basis of the vector space
spanned by the homogeneous polynomials in the generators of the Lie
algebra,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.64)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where the double dots indicate totally symmetrised products,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.65)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

These symmetrised products may be simplified by using the basic Lie
algebraic relation,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are the structure constants.

Apart from forming a Lie algebra ( 5.66 ) the generators ( 5.65 ) also
close under anti commutation [ 118 , 119 ] ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

The simpler nontrivial algebra that matches these conditions is @xmath
in the representation given by @xmath hermitian matrices.

Following [ 120 , 121 ] it is feasible to choose @xmath and the
remaining @xmath of the @xmath ’s as in @xmath . Then the trace
condition also follows as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.68)
  -- -------- -- --------

and @xmath , @xmath are completely antisymmetric and completely
symmetric respectively.

From now we will work with these simplifications. The gauge potential
and the field strength will be explicitly written as,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.69)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.70)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where the @xmath ’s are the @xmath hermitian generators of @xmath that
satisfy the conditions ( 5.66 ), ( 5.67 ) and ( 5.68 ).

In order to derive the field equations we first vary the gauge field
@xmath to get the equation of motion for the gauge field,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.71)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the fermionic current

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.72)
  -- -------- -- --------

The variation of the matter field @xmath and @xmath in the action ( 5.53
) gives the equation of motion

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.73)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.74)
  -- -------- -- --------

Operating @xmath on ( 5.71 ) we get a current conservation law [ 110 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.75)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is also possible to obtain the current defined in ( 5.75 ) from (
5.53 ) by using a Nöther-like procedure [ 49 ] . Making the following
“global” transformations,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.76)
     @xmath      (5.77)
     @xmath      (5.78)
  -- -------- -- --------

if we set @xmath to a constant at the end of the calculation, the
conserved current ( 5.75 ) follows from ( 5.53 ).

### 5.3 Analysis for star deformed gauge symmetry

We discussed in section 5.1 that, the presence of gauge symmetry is
characterized by an identity called the gauge identity. The gauge
generators are related to this identity. As an application, the gauge
identity is first abstracted by simple inspection, after which the
generator is read off. The gauge transformations of the fields can then
be computed from this generator.

In order to apply that analysis in the noncommutative space we write the
noncommutative version of the gauge identity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.79)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is the analogue of ( 5.6 ) and the noncommutative gauge
transformations of the fields

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.80)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is the analogue of ( 5.4 )

In order to find the gauge identity we have to first derive the Euler
derivatives. This is simply done by considering an arbitrary variation
of the action ( 5.53 ), expressed in terms of the variations of the
basic fields,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.81)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath are the Euler derivatives

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.82)
     @xmath      (5.83)
     @xmath      (5.84)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here the noncommutative covariant derivative @xmath is defined in the
adjoint representation ( 5.54 ) i. e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.85)
     @xmath      (5.86)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have used ( 5.66 ) and ( 5.67 ). We now define a quantity
@xmath , involving the various Euler derivatives of the system as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.87)
  -- -------- -- --------

Exploiting ( 5.86 ) and ( 5.82 , 5.83 , 5.84 ) the above expression, by
an explicit calculation, is found out to be zero, i. e. it vanishes
identically without using any equations of motion,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.88)
  -- -------- -- --------

The above relation is the cherished gauge identity for the model ( 5.53
). The structure of @xmath in ( 5.87 ) is similar to the general form (
5.79 ) in the sense that it involves the appropriate Euler derivatives.
To find the generator @xmath let us write ( 5.79 ) in a convenient way
which is more suitable for our particular model,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.89)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The values of the generators @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are obtained by
comparing ( 5.87 ) and ( 5.89 ). Since the calculations involve some
subtlety due to the noncommutative nature of the coordinates, few
intermediate steps are presented here. The contribution coming from the
space component of the gauge field Euler derivative @xmath is written
from ( 5.88 ) as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.90)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Using the properties ( 5.45 , 5.46 ), ( 5.90 ) is written in the
following way

  -- -- -- -------- -------- --------
           @xmath            (5.91)
           @xmath   @xmath   
                    @xmath   
  -- -- -- -------- -------- --------

This has to be identified with the @xmath contribution coming from (
5.89 ) which is given by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.92)
  -- -------- -- --------

Comparing ( 5.91 ) and ( 5.92 ) we obtain,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.93)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Other components of the gauge generator can be obtained in a similar
way. Here we give the full expressions of these components which will be
useful in finding the gauge transformations of the different fields.

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.94)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.95)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.96)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.97)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Let us next consider the gauge transformations. From ( 5.80 ) we write
the gauge transformation equation for the space component of the gauge
field

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.98)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where we have changed the notation @xmath by @xmath . Exploiting the
identity [ 118 , 119 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (5.99)
  -- -------- -- --------

and interchanging @xmath , the generator ( 5.93 ) is recast as,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.100)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

Use of ( 5.100 ) along with the identities ( 5.45 ) and ( 5.46 ) in (
5.98 ) implies that

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.101)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the operator @xmath had already been defined in ( 5.86 ).
Similarly the generators ( 5.94 , 5.95 ) lead to the zeroth component

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.102)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Combining the two results ( 5.101 ) and ( 5.102 ) we get the following
star covariant gauge transformation rule for the gauge field

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.103)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using the above equation the gauge variation of the field strength
tensor is obtained from its definition ( 5.51 )

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.104)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The star gauge transformation of the matter fields are obtained in a
similar manner

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.105)
     @xmath      (5.106)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Thus the star gauge transformations of all the fields have been
systematically obtained. They reproduced the results ( 5.103 , 5.105 ,
5.106 ) previously stated in Section 5.2 ( 5.54 – 5.57 ) under which the
action ( 5.53 ) is invariant.

The generators @xmath are mapped with the gauge identity @xmath ( 5.88 )
by the relation ( 5.79 ). If we set @xmath , then these just correspond
to the usual commutative space results for Yang–Mills theory in the
presence of matter [ 111 ] . This implies that, as it occurs in the
gauge transformations, the mapping ( 5.79 ) is also a star deformation
of the usual undeformed (commutative space) map.

The analysis presented above is very general and can be done for the
first order action for noncommutative non-Abelian theory. Let us briefly
summarize the results. The first order action for the pure gauge field
is given by,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.107)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

Here @xmath and @xmath are treated as independent fields. Variation of
these two fields lead to the following equations of motion,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.108)
     @xmath      (5.109)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The gauge identity containing the Euler derivatives @xmath and @xmath is
given by,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.110)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Now ( 5.79 ) is written in the following way,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.111)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Comparison of ( 5.110 ) and ( 5.111 ) gives the generators ( 5.93 – 5.95
) and the new generator

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.112)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Using ( 5.112 ) in ( 5.80 ), gauge variation of the @xmath is obtained
independently

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.113)
              @xmath   @xmath      (5.114)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

The gauge variation of the @xmath field can be obtained similarly.

Let us now mention a technical point. In obtaining the gauge
transformations – say ( 5.101 ) from ( 5.98 ), use is made of identities
like ( 5.45 ), ( 5.46 ) which are strictly valid over the whole four
dimensional space time. Since ( 5.98 ) involves only the space integral,
manipulations based on these identities imply only space-space
noncommutativity. This is quite reminiscent of the Hamiltonian
formulation of gauge symmetries [ 119 ] where @xmath from the beginning.

### 5.4 Analysis for twisted gauge symmetry

For simplicity we take the pure gauge theory

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.115)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the field strength tensor was defined in ( 5.51 ).

Using the undeformed gauge transformation ( 5.59 ) and the deformed
coproduct rule ( 5.63 ), the variation of the (star) product of gauge
fields is also seen to be undeformed,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.116)
  -- -------- -- ---------

which is the exact analogue of,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.117)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

Here @xmath is the commutative space gauge field with normal gauge
transformation. The above result is used to find the gauge
transformation of the field strength tensor

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.119)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath            (5.120)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

Likewise one finds,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.121)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Both @xmath and @xmath have the usual (undeformed) transformation
properties. Thus the action ( 5.115 ) is invariant under the gauge
transformation ( 5.116 ) and the deformed coproduct rule ( 5.63 ).

There is another way of interpreting the gauge invariance which makes
contact with the gauge identity. Making a gauge variation of the action
( 5.115 ) and taking into account the twisted coproduct rule ( 5.63 ),
we get

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.123)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

Now using the result ( 5.119 ) each term of ( 5.123 ) can be computed
separately. For example we concentrate on the first term. Using the
identity ( 5.45 ) and the trace condition ( 5.68 ) we write the first
term as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.124)
              @xmath   @xmath      (5.125)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Making use of ( 5.119 ) and dropping the surface terms the above
expression is found out to be,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.126)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

The second term of ( 5.123 ) is identically zero due to the
antisymmetric nature of @xmath . We write that as,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.129)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

The third term is written as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.130)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

Using the antisymmetry of @xmath and dropping the various surface terms,
we write the above expression as,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.131)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

Other terms can be obtained in a similar manner. Combining all these
terms we finally get,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.132)
                                @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath            (5.133)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------

where,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.134)
  -- -------- -- ---------

that vanishes identically. Note that this is exactly the same as the
expression in the gauge identity ( 5.88 ) without the fermionic fields.
This proves the invariance of the action.

Let us now repeat the analysis of the previous section with appropriate
modifications. Since the gauge transformations are undeformed, the gauge
generators are expected to have the same form as in the commutative
space. To see this note that the gauge variation of the zeroth component
of the @xmath field, following from ( 5.116 ), can be written as,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.135)
              @xmath   @xmath      (5.136)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Clearly the above result can be expressed in our standard form ( 5.80 ),

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.137)
              @xmath   @xmath      (5.138)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

where

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.139)
     @xmath      (5.140)
  -- -------- -- ---------

is the gauge generator. Similarly

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.141)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

is written in the form

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.142)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

for the value

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.143)
  -- -------- -- ---------

No star products appear in the gauge generators @xmath and their
structure is similar to the undeformed commutative space expressions. To
identify the difference (both from the commutative space results and the
star deformed results) it is essential to look at the gauge identity and
its connection with the corresponding gauge generator.

Now as already implied in ( 5.134 ), we have a gauge identity for this
system, exactly similar to the previous case,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.144)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where @xmath is the Euler derivative defined in ( 5.134 ). The
Euler–Lagrange equation of motion is given by

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.145)
  -- -------- -- ---------

The gauge identity and the Euler derivatives are mapped by the relation,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.146)
  -- -------- -- ---------

where the values of @xmath and @xmath are equal to those of @xmath and
@xmath of the previous example, given in ( 5.94 ), ( 5.95 ) and ( 5.93
). This happens since the Euler derivatives and the gauge identity are
identical to those discussed in the previous section. Now we express
@xmath in terms of @xmath . To do this, ( 5.94 ) is rewritten under the
identification @xmath as,

  -- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath      (5.147)
  -- -------- -- ---------

Now making use of the definition of star product ( 5.44 ), the above
expression is written in the following way

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Note that the @xmath independent term is nothing but the gauge generator
@xmath given in ( 5.139 ). Similarly calculating the other components
@xmath and @xmath from ( 5.95 ) and ( 5.93 ) we obtain,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
                       @xmath      
                       @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.150)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------

Here @xmath is not the generator, rather it is @xmath ( 5.139 , 5.140 ,
5.143 ). Although the generator remains undeformed, the relation mapping
the gauge identity with the generator is neither the commutative space
result nor its star deformation as found in the other approach. Rather,
it is twisted from the undeformed result. The additional twisted terms
are explicitly given in ( 5.4 ). Expectedly, in the limit @xmath the
twisted terms vanish.

### 5.5 Discussion

Gauge symmetries on canonically deformed coordinate spaces were
considered. Within a common Lagrangian framework both types of gauge
symmetries in these noncommutative spaces were discussed. Explicit
structures of the gauge generators were obtained in either case. The
connection of these generators with the gauge identity, which must exist
whenever there is a gauge symmetry, was also established. In the former
case, this connection was a star deformation of the commutative space
result. In the latter case, on the other hand, the commutative space
result was appropriately twisted. A first order formulation of the
deformed gauge transformation was also given where the gauge variation
of the field strength tensor and the gauge field were found
independently. The results thus obtained were shown to be consistent
with the second order formulation. All results obtained here reduce to
the usual commutative space expressions in the limit of vanishing @xmath
.

It is quite remarkable that these fundamental properties of gauge
symmetries (i. e. occurrence of gauge identity and its connection with
the corresponding generator through the Euler derivatives) were found in
the noncommutative theory, adopting either of the two interpretations.
This strongly suggests a meaningful interpretation for gauge
transformation on noncommutative spaces.

## Chapter 6 Noncommutative gauge theory: Hamiltonian analysis

Apart from the Lagrangian formulation there is also a Hamiltonian
formulation of describing the gauge symmetries of a commutative space
action [ 113 , 114 , 122 ] . In this approach, Dirac’s [ 69 ] conjecture
is followed to obtain the gauge generators from a linear combination of
the first class constraints. The gauge variation of the fields are then
found by Poisson bracketing the generator with the respective fields.

Here we provide a systematic Hamiltonian analysis of gauge theory on a
canonical noncommutative space. The analysis is applied for both cases –
star deformed gauge transformation with usual coproduct rule and
undeformed gauge transformation with twisted coproduct rule. In this
sense this chapter is complementary to the previous chapter where
Lagrangian analysis was performed for both the star deformed and the
twisted gauge symmetry. As a specific model, the same noncommutative
Yang–Mills action coupled to fermionic matter has been taken. The first
class constraints (both primary and secondary) of the theory are
identified. The gauge generator is formed by taking a linear combination
of these first class constraints. The independent gauge parameters are
identified to write the generator in an appropriate way. The Poisson
brackets between this generator and the field variables give the star
deformed gauge transformations. Subsequently by providing a “twist” to
the Poisson brackets, the twisted gauge transformations are obtained.
This twist is dictated by a novel interpretation of the twisted
coproduct of gauge transformations. We find that the twisted coproduct
is the normal coproduct with the stipulation that the gauge parameter is
pushed outside the star operation at the end of all computations.

### 6.1 General formulation

We first give a general description of a field theoretical model defined
on a canonical noncommutative space. The results are basically
appropriate star deformations of the commutative space results.

As a starting point we recall that, the Euler–Lagrange equation of
motion is derived from the action principle by requiring the
commutativity of an arbitrary @xmath variation with the time
differentiation i. e.

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the following Hamiltonian analysis, based on [ 113 , 114 , 122 ] , we
impose this requirement to derive few important results.

We consider a system with a canonical Hamiltonian @xmath and a set of
first class constraints @xmath . In general @xmath includes both the
primary and secondary constraints and satisfy the following involutive
Poisson algebra

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.2)
     @xmath      (6.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath are structure functions.

For such a system the total Hamiltonian is given by the sum of the
canonical Hamiltonian and a linear combination of the primary first
class constraints.

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here @xmath are Lagrange multipliers. The label @xmath denotes the
primary first class constraints while @xmath is kept for the secondary
sector. The Hamilton’s equations are obtained by using ( 6.4 )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

The generator of the system, according to Dirac’s algorithm is a linear
combination of all the first class constraints,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Though the number of gauge parameters appearing in the above equation is
@xmath , all of them are not independent. In fact the number of
independent @xmath s is given by the number of independent primary first
class constraints (labeled by ‘ @xmath ’). To find the relations among
these parameters, we review the method of [ 119 ] which is an adaptation
of the commutative space approach discussed in [ 113 , 114 , 122 ] .

The gauge transformation of a variable @xmath is obtained by Poisson
bracketing it with the gauge generator @xmath defied in ( 6.6 )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

This equation together with ( 6.5 ) yields,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.8)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

and

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.9)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Equating ( 6.8 ) with ( 6.9 ) and using the Jacobi identity we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (6.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

Making use of the algebra ( 6.2 ) and ( 6.3 ), we write the above
equation as,

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Since the constraints are taken to be irreducible (i. e. independent) we
get the following conditions, from the secondary and primary sectors,
respectively,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.11)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.12)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The first relation expresses the fact that the gauge parameters @xmath
are not all independent. In fact we find that, as stated earlier, the
number of independent parameters of a gauge system is equal to the
number of primary first class constraints. On the other hand, the second
equation gives the variation of the Lagrange multipliers.

### 6.2 Analysis for star deformed gauge symmetry

The general analysis of a gauge theory on noncommutative space is now
used here for the model ( 5.53 ) to study its Hamiltonian description.
Throughout the chapter we assume @xmath to avoid higher order time
derivatives. Due to the presence of grassmanian variables in our model (
5.53 ), the Poisson brackets in the previous section should be replaced
by the graded brackets. The graded brackets between the fermionic
variables are given by,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

The canonical momenta of the Lagrangian ( 5.53 ),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

satisfy the basic Poisson bracket relation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

The zeroth component of the momenta ( 6.14 ) leads to a primary
constraint

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

The canonical Hamiltonian of the system is given by,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.17)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where the operator @xmath has already been defined in ( 5.86 ). Now
using ( 6.15 ), the secondary constraints of the system are computed

  -- -- -- --------
           (6.18)
  -- -- -- --------

Note that this constraint is the zeroth component of the equation of
motion ( 5.71 ) expressed in phase space variables. The algebra of the
@xmath constraints is trivial,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.19)
     @xmath      (6.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

The algebra of the constraint @xmath with itself is also found to close.
Since this calculation involves some nontriviality, couple of
intermediate steps are presented here. We write

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.22)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Here the star( @xmath ) anticommutator is defined as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

The graded brackets of the terms @xmath and @xmath separately close
among themselves. Let us show it first for @xmath [ 118 ] . Using the
identity ( 5.99 ) we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (6.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (6.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

Exploiting the Jacobi identity

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (6.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

the remaining terms of @xmath are written as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

Combining the expressions ( 6.24 ), ( 6.25 ) and ( 6.27 ), we get the
closed algebra

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now to show that the graded bracket @xmath really closes we use the
product rule

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The graded bracket ( 6.13 ), together with the product rule ( 6.29 ) and
the identity ( 5.99 ) allow us to compute the following bracket

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

Combination of ( 6.28 ) and ( 6.30 ) gives the closure of @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the limit @xmath the above expression reduces to the standard
commutative space result @xmath . The involutive algebra of the
canonical Hamiltonian with the constraints is found to be,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.32)
     @xmath      (6.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

The term @xmath of ( 6.3 ) vanishes due to the algebra ( 6.19 ) and (
6.20 ). So we simplify ( 6.11 ) as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

The @xmath function defined in ( 6.2 ) is found from the algebra ( 6.32
) and ( 6.33 )

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.35)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.36)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Now we write ( 6.34 ) in its expanded form as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

Using ( 6.35 ) and ( 6.36 ) in the above equation we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

so that

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.39)
  -- -------- -- --------

thereby eliminating @xmath in favour of @xmath . This result is used in
( 6.6 ) to write the generator in terms of the single parameter ( @xmath
) as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the constraints @xmath and @xmath were defined in ( 6.16 ) and (
6.18 ). After obtaining the complete form of the generator, we can now
calculate the variation of the different fields from ( 6.7 ),

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.41)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Let us first study the gauge transformation of the field @xmath . The
variation of its time component is

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.42)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where we have used the identity ( 5.45 ). The variation of the space
component is likewise given by,

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath            
              @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Now dropping the boundary term and using the cyclicity property ( 5.46 )
we write the above expression as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.43)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Combining ( 6.42 ) and ( 6.43 ) we obtain,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

thereby reproducing ( 5.54 ) with the identification @xmath . In a
likewise manner the gauge transformation of the matter fields are also
obtained,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.45)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.46)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

which reproduces ( 5.56 ) and ( 5.57 ).

It is also possible to compute the gauge variations of star composites
in the same way. For example,

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Using the identity ( 5.99 ) the argument of @xmath in the first integral
and that of @xmath in the second integral is shifted from @xmath to
@xmath so that star product is defined only at the same point ( @xmath
). Finally, using ( 5.45 ) and ( 5.46 ), and keeping in mind the
grassmanian nature of the fermionic field we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

This is the result one also finds by using ( 6.45 ) and the standard
coproduct rule,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.48)
              @xmath   @xmath      (6.49)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Likewise, other star composites can be treated identically. This
completes the Hamiltonian analysis of star deformed gauge symmetry. Note
that the standard coproduct rule ( 5.58 ) is necessary for the
invariance of the action as well as the consistency of the analysis.

### 6.3 Analysis for twisted gauge symmetry

So far we were discussing about the star deformed gauge transformation
from a general Hamiltonian formulation which obeys the normal coproduct
rule ( 5.58 ). But as discussed in the previous chapter the action (
5.53 ) is also invariant under the undeformed gauge transformations (
5.59 – 5.62 ) with the twisted coproduct rule ( 5.63 ).

In fact from ( 5.63 ), the twisted gauge variation of the composite
fields ( @xmath ) was found in ( 5.116 ) to finally deduce @xmath .

The gauge variation of the other star composites are similarly computed
from ( 5.63 ),

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.50)
     @xmath      (6.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is noteworthy that not only the gauge transformations of the basic
fields but also the transformation rules for the star products of
variables are identical to the corresponding undeformed relations.

We now present an alternative interpretation of the twisted coproduct
rule ( 5.63 ). The results ( 5.116 ), ( 6.50 ), ( 6.51 ) are seen to
follow by using the standard coproduct rule ( 5.58 ) but pushing the
gauge parameter @xmath outside the star operation at the end of the
computations. Denoting this manipulation as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

we find

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.53)
              @xmath   @xmath      (6.54)
              @xmath   @xmath      (6.55)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

which reproduces ( 6.51 ). Likewise we see,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.56)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

which reproduces ( 6.50 ).

We now suitably modify the Hamiltonian formulation of the previous
section to systematically obtain the undeformed gauge transformations (
5.59 – 5.62 ) as well as the relations ( 5.116 ), ( 6.50 ), ( 6.51 )
manifesting the twisted Leibniz rule. As far as the gauge generator is
concerned the analysis is similar to the previous case and the same
expression ( 6.40 ) is obtained. This is not unexpected since the Gauss
constraint defining the generator is basically the time component of the
field equations which are identical in both treatments. The difference
can come only through the computation of the relevant Poisson brackets
that lead to the gauge transformations. In our interpretation the
twisted coproduct is just the standard coproduct with the proviso that
the gauge parameter is pushed outside the star operation at the end of
the computations. This motivates us to adopt a similar prescription for
computing the modified Poisson brackets.

The gauge variation of the time component of @xmath field is found by
suitably Poisson bracketing with ( 6.40 ) (renaming @xmath as @xmath ),

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.57)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where in the last step we put @xmath outside the star product following
our prescription. The variation of the space component is also
calculated in a similar way

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Now dropping the boundary term, using the relation ( 5.45 ) and the
cyclicity property ( 5.46 ) we write the above expression as

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

Finally, keeping the gauge parameter @xmath outside the star product we
obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.58)
  -- -------- -- --------

Combining ( 6.57 ) and ( 6.58 ) we write the gauge variation in a
covariant notation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.59)
  -- -------- -- --------

The gauge variation of the fermionic field can be obtained in a similar
way

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.60)
     @xmath      (6.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

The calculation of the gauge variation of composite fields needs some
care. For example, consider the variation @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.62)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

As mentioned earlier, the star product for two functions is defined only
at the same spacetime point. So using the identity ( 5.99 ) we change
the argument of @xmath and @xmath from @xmath to @xmath to obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.63)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Using the properties ( 5.45 ), ( 5.46 ) and finally removing the gauge
parameter @xmath outside the star product we obtain

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.64)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Following the symmetry algebra ( 5.66 , 5.67 ) we write the above result
as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.65)
                                @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath            (6.66)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The space part is also obtained in a similar way

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (6.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

Expressions ( 6.66 , 6.67 ) are basically the time and space component
of the equation ( 6.50 ). The gauge variations of the other composites
are computed in the same way reproducing the results ( 5.116 ), ( 6.51 )
obtained by using the twisted coproduct rule.

### 6.4 Discussion

We have studied a Hamiltonian formulation of gauge symmetry on canonical
noncommutative space. The gauge generator, obtained in this formulation,
is same for two different gauge transformations. It reproduced star
deformed gauge transformations with a normal coproduct as well as
undeformed gauge transformations with a twisted coproduct. This was
based on an appropriate interpretation of computing the Poisson brackets
that led to the gauge transformations. Some examples were worked out
explicitly.

Our analysis provided a new interpretation of the twisted coproduct
rule. It was found that the twisted coproduct was equivalent to the
normal coproduct with the condition that the gauge parameter had to be
taken outside the star operation at the end of the computations. This
interpretation keeps the twisted gauge transformation identical to the
corresponding commutative space gauge transformations even for the
composite fields.

As mentioned in the previous chapter, recent study [ 45 , 46 , 49 ]
stressed that twisted symmetry is not a physical symmetry at all. It is
quite different from the usual gauge transformations, in the sense that
twisted transformations do not act only on fields. Nevertheless we were
successful in suitably defining gauge generators and transformations.
This was quite reassuring since for a genuine symmetry (twisted or
otherwise), a generator must be appropriately defined from which
transformation rules of the field variables can be obtained.

## Chapter 7 Noncommutative gravity

Field theories formulated on a noncommutative space include an intrinsic
length scale which is supposed to be of the order of Planck length.
Construction of a noncommutative general theory of relativity which is
considered to be a necessity for quantizing gravity [ 123 ] remains an
open subject. There are many approaches to this problem. In [ 47 ] a
deformation of Einstein’s gravity was studied using a construction based
on gauging the noncommutative @xmath de Sitter group and applying the
Seiberg – Witten map [ 26 ] with subsequent contraction to @xmath .
Construction of a noncommutative gravitational theory was also based on
a twisted diffeomorphism algebra [ 48 , 124 ] . In these approaches
physical symmetries such as general covariance and local Lorentz
invariance are difficult to interpret. There is a formulation called
minimal formulation of noncommutative gravity where physical symmetries
are restored [ 125 ] by taking a class of restricted coordinate
transformations that preserve the canonical noncommutative algebra. This
restriction corresponds to the theory of unimodular gravity [ 126 , 127
, 128 , 129 , 130 ] where only volume preserving diffeomorphism is
considered. Similar discussion for a covariantly constant @xmath is
given in [ 131 ] .

A remarkable feature is that there is no first order correction for
various theories of noncommutative gravity for constant @xmath [ 47 , 48
, 132 ] . Nontrivial contribution starts from the second order term [ 47
, 48 , 133 ] . Since the discussions of noncommutative gravity are
mostly performed on the canonical noncommutative spacetime ( 5.37 ) the
question that naturally appears is whether the vanishing of the order
@xmath correction is due to this restriction. Perhaps a more general
noncommutative structure might lead to order @xmath effects.

In this chapter, instead of taking a constant @xmath we take the
noncommutative parameter in the Lie algebraic form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the structure constant @xmath is antisymmetric in all the three
indices and the constant @xmath is a measure of noncommutativity. We
carry out our analysis in the framework of the tetrad formalism. Here
general coordinate invariance is viewed as a local symmetry implemented
by the tetrad as the gauge field along with the local Lorentz invariance
@xmath generated by the spin connection fields. Since this formalism is
closely related to the usual gauge theory one can use the results of
noncommutative gauge theory [ 26 , 40 , 41 , 42 ] in the context of
noncommutative gravity. The Seiberg – Witten map [ 26 ] can be used to
cast the theory of noncommutative gravity as a perturbative theory in
the noncommutative parameter @xmath . Such maps have been exhaustively
available for the canonical structure [ 42 , 134 , 135 , 136 ] . Maps
for the gauge field in a general noncommutative space have been given in
[ 137 ] without giving the map for the field strength tensor. In fact
defining a field strength tensor in a general noncommutative space is
not obvious. So we develop the appropriate maps for the gauge field and
the field strength tensor in the Lie – algebra valued noncommutative
space.

In section – 7.1 the class of the general coordinate transformations
consistent with the algebra ( 7.1 ) is discussed. In the next section we
construct the Seiberg–Witten maps for the gauge potentials and field
strength tensors valid for the Lie algebraic noncommutativity. Using
these maps noncommutative gravity is reduced to an equivalent
commutative theory in section – 7.3. We show that there is no first
order correction in the action of noncommutative gravity, exactly as
happens for canonical (constant) noncommutativity.

### 7.1 General coordinate transformation in noncommutative space

The formulation of gravity on noncommutative space time poses problems.
This is seen by considering the general coordinate transformation,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

and realizing that, for arbitrary @xmath , it is not compatible with the
algebra ( 7.1 ). However it is possible to find a restricted class of
coordinate transformations ( 7.2 ) which preserves the algebra ( 7.1 ).
Before demonstrating this point let us define the star product for the
Lie algebra valued coordinate dependent noncommutative structure.

The structure of ( 5.40 ) remains unchanged for the Lie algebraic
noncommutativity. We write the product of exponentials in the following
way,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

Using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula ( 5.41 ), an explicit form of
@xmath is obtained for the coordinates @xmath satisfying ( 7.1 )

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.4)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Following the same method discussed in chapter 5, the star product
between two functions is written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Now we can replace the operator product between two noncommutative
variables by the @xmath product ( 7.5 ) between the corresponding
commutative variables. Thus using ( 7.2 ) in ( 7.1 ) we get

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

Using the formula ( 7.5 ) one derives the following relation [ 40 ] ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

It is then straightforward to find, using ( 7.7 ), that in order to
preserve ( 7.1 ), @xmath must satisfy the condition,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

A nontrivial solution of the above equation is given by,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

This can be checked by using the Jacobi identity following from ( 7.1 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

Equation ( 7.9 ) gives the restricted class of general coordinate
transformations under which the noncommutative algebra ( 7.1 ) is
preserved. From ( 7.9 ) we find that

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The Jacobian of the transformations ( 7.2 ) is then unity which means
the transformations are volume preserving. Thus the theory belongs to
the noncommutative version of unimodular gravity.

### 7.2 Seiberg-Witten map for Lie algebraic noncommutativity

The Seiberg – Witten maps for the non-Abelian noncommutative gauge
fields where the noncommutative coordinates satisfy the canonical
algebra are elaborately worked out in the literature [ 26 , 40 , 41 , 42
, 134 , 135 , 136 ] . But the corresponding results for Lie algebraic
noncommutative structure are only sketched [ 40 , 41 , 137 ] . Here we
give a comprehensive analysis where the results are valid upto first
order in @xmath .

In the commutative space, for non-Abelian gauge theory, the matter field
@xmath and the gauge potential @xmath transform as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

The commutator of two gauge transformations is another gauge
transformation

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the noncommutative space, on the other hand, the closure ( 7.13 )
does not hold [ 40 ] within the Lie algebra but is satisfied in the
enveloping algebra. Thus the noncommutative field @xmath transforms as [
41 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is written in * product formalism as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that the structure of this equation is same as the star deformed
gauge transformation (( 5.56 ) with @xmath ) for canonical
noncommutativity. We use the notation @xmath instead of @xmath for later
convenience. Throughout the chapter we shall not consider the other type
of gauge transformation, namely the twisted gauge transformation.

Here the gauge parameter @xmath is in the enveloping algebra [ 41 ]
similar to ( 5.64 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

All these infinitely many parameters @xmath depend only on the
commutative gauge parameter @xmath , the gauge potential @xmath and on
their derivatives. We denote this as @xmath . Then it follows from (
7.15 ) that the variation of @xmath is expressed as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now we impose the requirement of closure,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

Then the above equation is written in the explicit form

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

Expanding @xmath in @xmath

  -- -- -- --------
           (7.20)
  -- -- -- --------

we obtain up to first order,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (7.21)
  -- -------- -- --------

The solution is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.22)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath was defined in ( 7.1 ).

The noncommutative gauge potential @xmath is most naturally introduced
by the covariant coordinate @xmath [ 40 ] . It is defined in the
following way

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

which, acting on @xmath , transforms covariantly [ 41 ] , i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

This requirement together with ( 7.14 ) fixes the transformation of
@xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.25)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since gauge transformation does not act on the coordinates,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

we get from ( 7.23 ) and ( 7.25 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.27)
  -- -------- -- --------

In the star product formalism

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.28)
  -- -------- -- --------

The gauge potential @xmath is defined through @xmath in the following
way [ 42 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.29)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since @xmath is not a constant it is not possible to find the
transformation of @xmath in closed form. We give the result correct upto
first order.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.30)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the inverse of @xmath i. e. @xmath .

To get the Seiberg – Witten map for the gauge potential we expand it in
a perturbative series in @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

Computing the gauge transformation of @xmath from the above equation
(using ( 7.12 )) and comparing with ( 7.30 ) we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.32)
  -- -------- -- --------

The solution to the last equation is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

where,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.34)
  -- -------- -- --------

Combining ( 7.31 ) and ( 7.33 ) we get the map for the gauge potential

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.35)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that in the case of constant @xmath the last term on the r.h.s.
vanishes and one gets back the usual Seiberg–Witten map [ 26 ] .

In order to construct the map for the Yang – Mills field @xmath we first
define a second rank tensor

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

or equivalently

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.36)
  -- -------- -- --------

which transforms covariantly

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.37)
  -- -------- -- --------

Now we define the Yang – Mills @xmath through

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.38)
  -- -------- -- --------

From ( 7.36 ), we get the following expression for @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.39)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The gauge transformation of @xmath is obtained from ( 7.37 ) and ( 7.38
) as,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.40)
  -- -------- -- --------

The gauge transformation of @xmath can also be obtained from its
definition ( 7.39 ) and the gauge transformation ( 7.30 ) of @xmath .
These are found to be identical.

Using the map of @xmath in ( 7.39 ) we obtain the map for the field
strength tensor @xmath . It is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.41)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where the commutative space covariant derivative was defined in the
adjoint representation ( 5.59 ). Here also for constant @xmath the map
for @xmath ( 7.41 ) reproduces the corresponding well known
Seiberg–Witten map [ 26 ] .

### 7.3 Noncommutative gravity

In the framework of Poincar @xmath gauge gravity, the noncommutative
gauge transformation is now decomposed into two generators- one is the
generator of inhomogeneous translation @xmath and the other is the
generator of the local Lorentz algebra @xmath

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.42)
  -- -------- -- --------

Here @xmath is the local translation of the tetrad which must be
restricted to the form given in equation ( 7.9 ) in order to preserve
the noncommutative algebra ( 7.1 ). The parameters @xmath characterize
the local Lorentz transformations at @xmath . We consider the following
vector representation of these generators for future calculation.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.43)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is the Minkowski metric,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.44)
  -- -------- -- --------

As is usual we denote the general coordinates by the Greek indices and
components with respect to the tetrad by Latin indices. Corresponding to
the noncommutative gauge transformations ( 7.42 ) we introduce the gauge
potential

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.45)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath are the components of the noncommutative tetrad @xmath
which are also the gauge fields corresponding to general coordinate
transformations and @xmath are the spin connection fields associated
with local Lorentz invariance. Since @xmath , the noncommutative tetrad
maps trivially on the commutative one [ 125 ] . Assuming the gauge
transformations and the spin connection fields in the enveloping algebra
we write

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.46)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.47)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.48)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.49)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Invoking the results ( 7.22 , 7.33 ) obtained in the last section we
write down the order @xmath corrections,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.50)
  -- -------- -- --------

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.51)
  -- -------- -- --------

The field strength tensor can also be expanded in a power series of
@xmath and we obtain from ( 7.41 )

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.52)
  -- -------- -- --------

where,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.53)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The field strength @xmath in general contains both Riemann tensor @xmath
and the torsion @xmath . Setting the classical torsion to be zero we get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.54)
  -- -------- -- --------

The noncommutative Riemann Tensor @xmath is obtained from

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.55)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath is identified with @xmath under the condition of zero
torsion. Explicitly

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.56)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the @xmath correction term is obtained from ( 7.53 ) as,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.57)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The Ricci tensor @xmath and the Ricci scalar @xmath are formed to
construct the action

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.58)
              @xmath   @xmath      (7.59)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

The first order correction term to the Lagrangian is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.60)
  -- -------- -- --------

It is convenient to arrange the correction as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.61)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath correspond to the contributions coming from the four pieces
appearing on the r.h.s. of ( 7.57 ) in the same order. It is now simple
to get the first term,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.62)
  -- -------- -- --------

For evaluating @xmath we first compute the part containing the covariant
derivative

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.63)
  -- -------- -- --------

where we have used the expression ( 5.59 ) for the covariant derivative
@xmath . Then the second correction term becomes

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.64)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Exploiting the various symmetries of the Riemann tensor, spin connection
and the noncommutative structure @xmath we can easily show that both
@xmath and @xmath individually vanish. Now the last two terms on the
r.h.s. of ( 7.61 ) are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.65)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.66)
  -- -------- -- --------

Clearly these terms owe their existence to the Lie – algebraic
noncommutativity assumed in the present work. Most significantly

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.67)
  -- -------- -- --------

identically, which can be demonstrated easily by changing dummy
variables in any one of the terms on the l.h.s. We thus find that the
first order correction of the Ricci scalar vanishes for the Lie
algebraic noncommutativity.

### 7.4 Discussion

We have constructed a noncommutative gravity theory where the spacetime
satisfy a general Lie algebra. A set of general coordinate
transformations has been found which keeps the noncommutative algebra
covariant. This restricted transformation is volume preserving and hence
the corresponding theory of gravity is a unimodular theory [ 126 , 127 ,
128 , 129 , 130 ] . Our formulation of noncommutative general relativity
is based on Poincar @xmath gauge gravity approach where each spacetime
point is associated with a set of local inertial coordinates, mutually
related by Lorentz transformation. Looking from the point of view of
noncommutative field theories the problem reduces to solving a
noncommutative Yang–Mills theory where the gauge group is @xmath . The
Seiberg–Witten maps for the noncommutative gauge parameters, potential
and field strengths have been worked out in detail. Using these results
we have expanded the noncommutative Ricci scalar in the powers of the
noncommutative parameter. The first order noncommutative correction is
found to vanish. This result was previously known for the canonical
noncommutative algebra [ 47 , 48 , 132 ] . Here we see that the same
result holds for Lie algebraic noncommutativity. From the present
analysis it is clear that the nonexistence of the @xmath correction is
due to various symmetries of the Riemann tensor and the spin connection
of the zero order theory. Thus it appears that the vanishing of the
first order correction is a general result which is perhaps due to the
inherent symmetries of the spacetime itself.

## Chapter 8 Conclusions

The main purpose of this thesis was to study different noncommutative
theories and the symmetries associated with them. In the second chapter
we have shown how phase space noncommutativity emerges in a planar
quantum mechanical problem, namely the generalized Landau problem. The
noncommutativity in the coordinates or in the momenta was described as a
dual aspect of the same phenomenon. We have adopted two different
methods, the Batalin–Tyutin embedding technique and the doublet
splitting approach to show this duality.

In the next chapter we had studied the gravitational quantum well
problem in a constant noncommutative phase space setting. By making
proper transformations we mapped the problem on the commutative space to
find the energy spectrum. The results were then compared with
experimental data to give an upper bound on the noncommutative
parameter. Our analytical findings agreed with the results previously
obtained by numerical method.

The issues related to the space time symmetry for noncommutative spaces
had been discussed in chapter 4. Both nonrelativistic and relativistic
examples were considered. The deformed Schrödinger generators for the
canonical noncommutativity and the deformed Poincar @xmath -conformal
generators for the Snyder type noncommutativity were obtained. The
deformed generators which satisfy the standard commutative space algebra
were derived, in either case, both by an algebraic approach and by a
dynamical approach. These two approaches were shown to be consistent.

In the next two chapters we had studied the gauge symmetries of
noncommutative field theory. As a specific model noncommutative
Yang–Mills theory was taken to analyze both the star deformed gauge
transformation and the twisted gauge transformation. In the Lagrangian
analysis the gauge generators were found to be different for two
different gauge symmetries. On the other hand, in the Hamiltonian
analysis, the generator was identical in either case. The gauge
transformations of the fields were obtained from the computations of
Poisson brackets which were different for two different gauge
symmetries.

In chapter 7, Seiberg–Witten maps were used to write the action for Lie
algebraic noncommutative gravity in terms of commutative variables. The
noncommutative correction appeared as a perturbative expansion in the
noncommutative parameter. By explicit computation we had shown that the
leading order correction was zero.

Thus in this thesis we studied different aspects of noncommutativity in
quantum mechanics, field theory and gravity. Symmetry analysis played an
important role in this study. We analyzed deformations of usual
symmetries like the external space time symmetry and the internal gauge
symmetry in the noncommutative theories. Here the usual methods of
analyzing commutative space theories were appropriately generalized to
study the noncommutative theories. It was reassuring that in the limit
of vanishing noncommutative parameter the theories reduced smoothly to
their commutative versions. In this way we saw that the noncommutative
theories had many novel properties and this subject can be approached as
a consistent theory of physics.
