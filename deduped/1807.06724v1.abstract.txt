Internet of Things (IoT), also referred to as the Internet of Objects, is
envisioned as a holistic and transformative approach for providing numerous
services. The rapid development of various communication protocols and
miniaturization of transceivers along with recent advances in sensing
technologies offer the opportunity to transform isolated devices into
communicating smart things. Smart things, that can sense, store, and even
process electrical, thermal, optical, chemical, and other signals to extract
user-/environment-related information, have enabled services only limited by
human imagination.
  Despite picturesque promises of IoT-enabled systems, the integration of smart
things into the standard Internet introduces several security challenges
because the majority of Internet technologies, communication protocols, and
sensors were not designed to support IoT. Several recent research studies have
demonstrated that launching security/privacy attacks against IoT-enabled
systems, in particular wearable medical sensor (WMS)-based systems, may lead to
catastrophic situations and life-threatening conditions. Therefore, security
threats and privacy concerns in the IoT domain need to be proactively studied
and aggressively addressed. In this thesis, we tackle several domain-specific
security/privacy challenges associated with IoT-enabled systems.
