In this thesis are presented analytical results and numerical simulations
concerning resonant processes in a frozen gas. This work was begun with the
intent of modeling experiments involving energy transfer due to dipole-dipole
interactions between ultracold Rydberg atoms, and the subsequent propagation of
dipolar excitons. However, the results and the techniques developed to obtain
them are more generally applicable to a wide variety of problems.
  We start by studying a simplified model that considers only the energy
transfer process in an infinite medium of randomly distributed atoms. This
model is very instructive, because it gives a simplified arena in which to
develop the techniques that are used again and again throughout the thesis.
Exact analytical results are obtained for the time evolution of energy
transfer, its dependence on the detuning from resonance, and the localization
distance over which the transfer process is effective. The result for the
initial rate of energy transfer turns out to have general validity. This
soluble model also provides an excellent means for testing the numerical
simulations that are carried out for a finite sample.
  When we allow for the propagation of dipolar excitons, it is no longer
possible to obtain exact analytical solutions, but an approximation has been
found that agrees quite well with the numerical simulations for the amplitude
of the overall process. Simulations are necessary to find the sample-averaged
probability...
