This thesis is devoted to various questions connected with duality. It is
composed of two parts. The first part discusses some aspects of timelike
T-duality. We explore the possibility of compactification of supergravity
theories with various signatures (low energy limit of $M$-theories which are
dual under timelike T-dualities) on parallelizable internal seven dimensional
(pseudo-)spheres. We show that, beside the standard theory, only one of the
dual theories known as $M'$-theory can admit such a solution. The effective
four dimensional theory is non-supersymmetric and due to the presence of
torsion the symmetry of seven dimensional (pseudo-)sphere breaks down to
$Spin(3,4)$. In the second part, in an attempt to have a systematic discussion
of gaugings in supergravity, we show the isomorphism between the space of local
deformations of the appropriate zero coupling limit of the embedding tensor
Lagrangian and that of the second-order scalar-vector Lagrangian, describing
the bosonic sector of supergravity ignoring gravity, in a chosen duality frame
determined by embedding tensors. We analyze the BV-BRST deformation of a class
of scalar-vector coupled Lagrangians, which contains supergravity Lagrangians
as examples, and find a set of constraints that guarantee the consistency of
the deformations of the Lagrangians. We show in principle that for a large
class of theories considered in this thesis, the only deformations are those of
the Yang-Mills type associated with a subgroup of the rigid symmetries.
