## Chapter \thechapter Introduction

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the largest and most complex machine
ever built by mankind, gives particle physicists a powerful tool at hand
to verify existing models and probe the fundamental laws at very high
energies. The aim of the LHC is: First, to investigate whether the
Standard Model (SM) is still valid at the collider’s energies. Second,
to shed light on the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism and to find
or exclude a particle that fits the SM description of the Higgs boson [
7 , 8 , 9 ] . Third, to search for Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics
like supersymmetry or extra-dimensions or particles that could be Dark
Matter candidates. In the first run of the LHC, a Higgs-like particle
has been found with a mass of 125 GeV. Apart from that, several other
discoveries have been made including the first creation of a quark-gluon
plasma or the rare @xmath -decay. In the second run, in which the
center-of-mass energies will be increased even further, signals of BSM
physics are hoped to be detected and the properties of the Higgs further
explored.
Despite the existence of observations which the SM cannot accommodate at
the moment, e.g. the existence Dark Matter [ 10 ] or neutrino
oscillations [ 11 ] , it is still the only established theory of
particle physics to date that describes experimental data, a great
theoretical achievement of its own. Leaving out gravity, for which there
is no quantum theory available yet, it successfully describes (almost)
all relevant particle physical observables.
The SM is a relativistic quantum field theory with an @xmath gauge
symmetry. It describes three of the four fundamental forces of nature at
microscopic distances, namely electromagnetism, strong and weak force. ¹
¹ 1 For a full review of the Standard Model, see for example [ 12 , 13 ]
.
The @xmath symmetry accounts for the strong force and the corresponding
quantum field theory is called QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics, [ 14 ] ). It
describes the interactions between quarks and gluons. Quarks are,
besides leptons, the fundamental matter constituents and come in six
different flavors. Gluons are massless spin 1 particles (bosons)
carrying an @xmath colour charge and act as the mediators of the strong
force. Because the gauge group is non-Abelian [ 15 ] , QCD features two
remarkable properties: Confinement [ 16 ] and Asymptotic Freedom [ 17 ,
18 ] .
Confinement accounts for the fact that physical objects are always
colour-neutral at low energies, in particular no individual free quarks
or gluons are observed. Nonetheless, an analytical proof of this
property is still missing.
Asymptotic Freedom is a property of the theory. It means that due to the
running of the strong coupling @xmath , the strong force becomes small
at high energies (equivalentely, small distances), a fact that permits
the employment of perturbative techniques.
The weak force describes processes such as the decay of nuclei and the
interaction of neutrinos with matter. In the modern context, it is
better understood within the framework of the electroweak sector. By
electroweak sector, we mean the unification of weak and electromagnetic
forces [ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ] by Weinberg, Salam and Glashow, a major
success which allowed to understand both forces in the common framework
of the Electroweak Symmetry Breaking mechanism. Very similar to the
strong force, its gauge group is the non-Abelian @xmath . Contrary to
QCD, the @xmath - and @xmath -gauge bosons of the weak interaction are
not only massive, but with masses of 80 GeV and 91 GeV respectively,
they are quite heavy. Hence it is a short distance interaction and
appears to be ‘weak’.
Finally, @xmath is the gauge group of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) [ 23
] which is the quantum field theory describing the electromagnetic
force. Its gauge boson, the photon, is massless and due to the Abelian
nature of @xmath , photons do not interact with each other and the force
is of unlimited range.
What we today know as the Standard Model of particle physics is QCD
together with the electroweak sector. It has undergone countless checks
and investigations over many different aspects and it has been
exceptionally successful in making correct and accurate predictions for
a wide range of physical observables.
However, the SM is believed to be a mere low-energy approximation to a
still to be constructed unified field theory which would describe all
four forces at all energy regimes. The SM-Lagrangian encodes all
previosly known symmetry principles, for example conservation laws.
Although its mathematical formulation is very simple, we cannot
analytically solve the equations of motion. Only in certain parts of
phase-space we can perform reliable theoretical calculations which are
all based on perturbation theory. The underlying idea is that when the
coupling of the interaction term is small, one can do a series expansion
in which every term can be represented in a pictorial form. This is done
by the so-called Feynman diagrams [ 24 , 25 ] . Due to its clarity and
predictive power, the diagrammatical approach is the most popular for
theoretical calculations. The first term of the expansion usually gives
an estimate of the order of magnitude whereas in order to obtain the
first proper estimate, one has formally to go to next-to-leading order
(NLO) precision. More and more processes processes demand
next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) precision to match the precision of
the experimental data.
The discovery of the Higgs-like boson in 2012 has been a huge success [
26 , 27 ] . At the moment of writing this thesis, the LHC is warming up
for its second phase with a center-of-mass energy of up to 13 TeV. In
this second phase, as previously mentioned, it will be of great
importance to measure as many properties of the discovered particle as
possible and to continue the hunt for physics beyond the Standard Model.
So far, the absence of signals hinting to BSM physics is a little
disappointing as it does not define a clear direction for the theorists
to follow.
The high quality of LHC data raises the need for high-precision
theoretical predictions. The processes at the LHC are rather challenging
to calculate because they typically involve many particles and because
QCD plays the dominant role at the LHC. Furthermore, higher orders of
the perturbation expansion have to be calculated in order to match the
experimental precision. This has led to considerable progress in the
analytical and numerical techniques for the calculation of Standard
Model cross-sections. Apart from the usual diagrammatic approach, there
are other methods, some of the most popular ones being Unitarity Methods
[ 28 , 29 , 30 ] , the OPP-Method [ 31 , 32 ] , Mellin-Barnes
Representations [ 33 , 34 ] and Sector Decomposition [ 35 , 36 , 37 , 38
] . Thanks to these techniques, 2 @xmath 4 processes at NLO are the
standard nowadays, and even higher multiplicities are becoming more
accessible [ 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 ] . They have achieved an incredible
feat: The computation of Feynman graphs up to NNLO-level and in some
cases even beyond. Still, many important issues remain. When calculating
cross-sections one needs to consider tree- and loop-contributions
separately. Thus, a lot of effort has to be put into cancelling infrared
singularities between real and virtual corrections [ 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 ,
47 ] . Additional difficulties arise from threshold singularities that
lead to numerical instabilities.
Recently, a new method called the Loop–Tree Duality (LTD) [ 48 ] has
been developed, which is designed to attack these problems. The basic
concept at one-loop is to directly apply the Cauchy Residue Theorem to
the Feynman integrals. The outcome is a sum of tree level objects in
which each represents all possible single cuts of the considered
diagram. This form is called the ‘dual integral’, which closely
resembles the real corrections. The idea is to then combine the dual
integral with the tree-level contributions in order to treat them
simultaneously in a common Monte Carlo event generator. While initially
the technique was limited to one-loop graphs, it has been greatly
expanded since then. In [ 49 ] it has been shown how to extend it to
diagrams with an arbitrary number of loops and in [ 1 ] how to deal with
graphs which involve propagators that are raised to higher powers
(higher order poles).

### 1 Outline

The remainder of this thesis is organised as follows: In Chapter \ttitle
, we establish the fundamentals of this work. In Chapter \ttitle we
introduce the Loop–Tree Duality method alongside some illustrative
examples. In Chapter \ttitle , we formalize the notation and extend the
Loop–Tree Duality to double and higher order loop graphs. in Chapter
\ttitle we show how to deal with poles of higher multiplicities. In
Chapter \ttitle we report on the cancellation of singularities among
dual contributions as well as between real and virtual corrections for
massless internal lines. In Chapter \ttitle , we present details on the
numerical implementation of the Loop–Tree Duality for scalar one-loop
integrals. This is the first time that the LTD has been applied to
explicitly calculate Feynman diagrams and constitutes the main result of
this thesis. In Chapter \ttitle , we demonstrate that the computer
program used in Chapter \ttitle is also able to deal with tensor
integrals. We conclude the thesis with Chapter \ttitle in which we give
a summary and our future plans.

## Chapter \thechapter Standard Model Phenomenology

The Standard Model is a theory of particle physics that has been refined
continuously over the past, so that it is nowadays able to describe
almost all particle reaction processes that we observe in the laboratory
(particle colliders) as well as in space. Its tremendous success is
threefold:

-   The SM has the ability to explain a wide variety of experimental
    results.

-   The SM repeatedly predicted the existence of particles before their
    experimental discovery. This has been the case for the @xmath and
    @xmath bosons [ 50 , 51 ] , the gluon [ 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 ] and the
    charm [ 56 , 57 ] and top quarks [ 58 , 59 ] and very recently the
    Higgs boson [ 27 , 26 ] . For each of these particles, experiments
    later confirmed the predicted properties with good precision.

-   The SM has passed a huge number of precision tests with flying
    colours, the most famous one being the anomalous magnetic dipole
    moment of the electron [ 60 ] : The agreement between theory and
    measurement is up to the 13th digit, which is a unique achievement
    not only in particle physics, but in all science. Other examples of
    precisely predicted quantities are the Neutron Compton Wavelength [
    61 ] or the mass of the @xmath boson [ 62 ] .

All of these accomplishments have strengthend the confidence in the SM
as the proper theory for the description of the behaviour of elementary
particles excluding gravity.
We dedicate the next section to an instructive review of the basic
principles of the SM.

### 2 The Standard Model of Particle Physics

The Standard Model of particle physics is a quantum field theory which
nowadays allows us to correctly describe almost all physical processes
with high precision on a fundamental level. It is based on the gauge
group

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (1)
  -- -------- -- -----

where @xmath is the gauge group of the strong interaction, @xmath the
gauge group of the weak isospin, and @xmath the gauge group of the
hypercharge which is not identical with the gauge group of QED. To avoid
confusion, the notations @xmath and @xmath with subscripts hinting to
either the hypercharge ( @xmath ) or QED ( @xmath ) will be used.
Despite the interacting constituents being fields, the SM’s perturbative
description is carried out almost entirely in the particle picture. We
imagine the force between two matter particles to be mediated via
exchange particles. All interactions have in common that the matter
fields are spin @xmath fermions and the exchange particles spin @xmath
bosons, with the exception of the Higgs boson which has spin @xmath .

#### 2.1 Qcd

The QCD, Quantum ChromoDynamics, is a non-Abelian gauge theory with the
action

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (2)
  -- -------- -- -----

and the symmetry group @xmath . The fermion fields @xmath transform
under its fundamental representation. They are, apart from the gluons,
the dynamical degrees of freedom of the theory. There are six flavors of
quarks, each with a different mass. @xmath is the so-called covariant
derivative, defined as

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (3)
  -- -------- -- -----

with @xmath being the gluon field, which lives in the adjoint
representation of the gauge group. The group @xmath has @xmath
generators, hence @xmath has eight of them. They span the Lie algebra
@xmath and are normalised by @xmath and @xmath . @xmath is the field
strength tensor. It is an algebra-valued two-form defined by

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (4)
  -- -------- -- -----

The first two terms are a four-dimensional rotation known from QED; the
third term is typical for non-Abelian symmetry groups and the origin of
the gluon self-interaction.
Considering QCD in the absence of quarks, the only thing left is the
gluon self-interaction. This branch is called pure Yang-Mills theory. As
we mentined in the Introduction, QCD has two special properties,
Confinement and Asymptotic Freedom. They mainly have to do with the
running coupling @xmath of QCD. By running coupling we mean that the
coupling is dependent on the energy at which the process happens [ 12 ]
:

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (5)
  -- -------- -- -----

Confinement takes place at low energies at which the coupling is strong.
Physical states are always color singlets: As a consequence of the
non-Abelian gauge symmetry, the energy cost grows proportionally to the
distance, if one tries to separate the particles of a color singlet. At
some point it is energetically favorable for a new quark-antiquark pair
to appear. Hence, neither free quarks nor free gluons are observed in
nature.
Asymptotic freedom describes the phenomenon that the coupling of the
theory becomes weaker as the energy increases. At very high energies,
quarks and gluons are almost able to move as if they were free
particles. In this energy regime, perturbation theory is applicable.
However, one has to quantise the action first, a good method to do so is
the one by Faddeev and Popov [ 63 ] . An unwanted side effect of the
method is the introduction of ghost fields into the theory. They are
called ghosts because of their incorrect spin-statistic relation and
therefore are unphysical. To get rid of them, one can choose the axial
gauge, in which ghosts and gluons decouple and the gauge of the action
is fixed. From the gauge fixed action one can extract the propagators
and vertices which allow to calculate the contributions to the
perturbation series via the Feynman diagram approach. These diagarams
are pictorial representations of the terms of the perturbation series.
To calculate an amplitude of arbitrary order in @xmath , one draws all
the Feynman diagrams that contribute to the process, contracts them with
the outer polarisation vectors and spinors and finally sums them up.

A downside of this approach is that it consumes a lot of computational
power. For example, the number of Feynman diagrams that contribute to
the @xmath -gluon amplitude grows faster than @xmath ! [ 64 ] .
Techniques like color-ordered amplitudes [ 65 ] and (tree-level)
recurrence relations [ 66 , 67 , 68 ] have been developed to deal with
that problem.

#### 2.2 Electroweak Interaction

Until 1967, QED and weak interaction were two separate theories. In that
year, Salam, Weinberg and Glashow succeeded in understanding both
interactions as special cases of one unified theory called Electroweak
theory [ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ] . The reason why both interactions appear
to be so different is the spontaneously broken symmetry of the
Electroweak theory.
The corresponding action resembles the one of the QCD:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

The matter fields @xmath of the electroweak interaction are the six
leptons, but quarks do carry a weak charge as well. They can be
organised into three generations. Electron, muon and tau participate in
both the weak and the electromagnetic interactions. The corresponding
neutrinos interact exclusively weakly. Within the SM, they are supposed
to be massless, though recent experiments show that they actually have a
small nonzero mass. This allows to solve the solar neutrino problem
using the concept of neutrino oscillations [ 11 ] . The operator @xmath
is defined as:

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (6)
  -- -------- -- -----

The underlying symmetry group of the electroweak interaction is the
@xmath . In Eq. ( 6 ), the @xmath are the generators of the @xmath and
the hypercharge @xmath is the generator of the @xmath . Because of the
direct product of the two groups, they carry different coupling
constants @xmath and @xmath .
The fields @xmath and @xmath are the gauge fields of the theory. @xmath
is a field similar gluons of QCD with respect to their non-Abelian
character. The corresponding field strength tensor is obtained by
replacing @xmath with @xmath in equation ( 4 ). The field @xmath
transforms under the Abelian symmetry group @xmath . Thus its field
strength tensor does not have a commutator.
According to the way @xmath and @xmath appear in the Lagrangian, they
are massless. However, experiments show that the @xmath and @xmath
bosons indeed have a mass. To get rid of this flaw of the theory, one
introduces an additional field @xmath , the so-called Higgs-field, that
couples to the gauge bosons by the term @xmath . The a priori unphysical
and massless fields @xmath and @xmath now obtain their masses via the
Higgs-mechanism. By transforming the unphysical fields @xmath and @xmath
in physical ones, the @xmath -symmetry is broken down to a @xmath
-symmetry. Simultaneously the Lagrangian picks up the correct mass terms
for the @xmath and @xmath bosons as well as the photon. The other terms
of the Langrangian represent the potential of the Higgs field. This is
illustrated in greater detail in the next subsection.
Despite the similarities between QCD and electroweak interaction, the
latter one does not display the phenomenon “Confinement”. The reason for
this is that the exchange bosons of the electroweak interaction are very
heavy, namely 80 GeV for the @xmath and 91 GeV for the @xmath , which
does not allow for bound states. “Asymptotic Freedom”, however, is
observed for the weak interaction just as in QCD.

#### 2.3 Higgs Boson and Electroweak Symmetry Breaking

In the Standard Model, the gauge group @xmath is spontaneously broken.
The left-over symmetry is @xmath . One assumes the existence of an
additional complex scalar field which transforms under SU(2) and has
hypercharge @xmath . In the space of weak isospin, it can be represented
by a two-component vector with complex entries [ 69 ] .

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (7)
  -- -------- -- -----

@xmath is a complex field, i.e. it is composed of two components. The
three components @xmath and @xmath are absorbed into the longitudinal
modes of @xmath and @xmath . @xmath is the actual physical Higgs-field.
The Lagrangian of the Higgs-sector then reads

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (8)
  -- -------- -- -----

For the theory to be bound from below, @xmath has to be greater than
zero, @xmath , and furthermore @xmath for the symmetry to be
spontaneously broken. The covariant derivative is given by Eq. ( 6 ).
The Higgs-dublet has hypercharge @xmath ; from the minimization of the
potential @xmath follows

  -- -------- -- -----
     @xmath      (9)
  -- -------- -- -----

In the next step, the physical contributions to @xmath will be
calculated.

  -- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (10)
  -- -------- -------- -- ------

@xmath is already a physical field, but @xmath and @xmath are not. They
are transformed to physical fields by virtue of the transformations

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (11)
  -- -------- -- ------

and

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (12)
  -- -------- -- ------

Here, @xmath and @xmath are given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (13)
  -- -------- -- ------

This way, one can rewrite the part of the Lagrangian of equation ( 10 )
as

  -- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (14)
  -- -------- -------- -- ------

Now, the masses of the @xmath - and @xmath -bosons can be read off
easily:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (15)
  -- -------- -- ------

The couplings @xmath and @xmath are related to the elementary charge
@xmath by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (16)
  -- -------- -- ------

Within this framework, it is possible to have massive gauge bosons which
otherwise are forbidden by unbroken gauge symmetries.

### 3 Particle Phenomenology

Phenomenology is the branch of particle physics that deals with the
calculation of physical observables that can then be compared to
experimental measurements. In order to test a theory, solutions have to
be compared to experimental data. For the SM, there are two established
ways to calculate them: Lattice calculations and perturbation theory.
Since lattice techniques lie beyond the scope of this thesis, we focus
on the latter. As mentioned in Section 2.1 , perturbation theory (in the
coupling) is employed at high energies when the coupling of the theory
becomes small. Usually, Feynman diagrams are used to calculate the
individual contributions to the perturbation series. We distinguish
betweeen two main types of diagrams: Tree and loop diagrams. The the
leading order term is a tree-level contribution. Beyond leading order, a
Feynman diagram gets dressed with more lines. These can connect two
existing lines, thus leading to a loop or they connect to only one
existing line resulting in an additional external leg. We use the terms
next-to-leading order (NLO, one-loop) or next-to-next-to-leading order
(NNLO, two-loops) to indicate the accuracy up to which a certain
calculation has been performed. Today, the quality of data collected at
colliders like the LHC has reached a level that makes the inclusion of
terms beyond the leading order of perturbation theory necessary in order
to provide theoretical estimates of similar precision. Apart from the
cancellation of singularities between tree and loop corrections and
phase-space integrations with many external legs, loop diagrams are the
bottleneck when calculating scattering amplitudes. Hence, theorists are
looking for ways to efficiently calculate NLO and NNLO corrections. The
last decade in particular has seen a huge progress in the development of
calculational techniques to tackle computations at NLO and also some
progress at NNLO accuracy. In the LHC era, this is important, because of
the availability of large amounts of data to which theoretical
predictions can be compared to. Still, the task of obtaining theoretical
estimates that can be compared with LHC-data is not easy. Tree and loop
contributions have to be evaluated independently before bringing them
together. The Loop–Tree Duality method, which will be introduced in
Chapter \ttitle and which is at the heart of this thesis, reexpresses
loop-level objects in terms of tree-level objects. Thus it allows to
directly combine the two, in order to evaluate them simultaneously. This
evaluation is carried out using numerical integration. In the latter
chapters of the thesis, we present results of the of the first
implementation of the Loop–Tree Duality method as a computer progam.
This program calculates one-loop integrals using a numerical integrator
(Cuhre or VEGAS). Since the numerical integrator is employed as a black
box, we recapitulate the basics of numerical integration in Section 4 .

### 4 Numerical Integration Techniques

#### 4.1 Motivation for employing numerical techniques

In Chapters \ttitle and \ttitle , we are going to calculate a certain
type of three-dimensional integral.
Usually one is interested in knowing the value of an integral up to a
certain accuracy and wants to obtain the result within an acceptable
amount of time. Hence, a numerical integrator in the form of a computer
program is the proper tool for this task.
Our long-term goal is to set up a fully automated program which is able
to calculate (N)NLO cross-sections for arbitrary kinematics. In this
thesis, we do the first step by addressing the virtual part.

#### 4.2 Classical numerical integration

For the rest of this chapter, we closely follow the paper [ 70 ] by
Weinzierl, which is a nice introduction to the subject and is
recommended to readers with further interest in the matter.

Quadrature rules have been known for a long time. The numerical
integrator “Cuhre”, part of the Cuba-library [ 71 ] , uses quadrature
rules to estimate the integral, therefore their idea shall be
illustrated here. One distinguishes between formulae that evaluate the
integrand at equally spaced abscissas (Newton-Cotes type) and formulae
which evaluate the integrand at carefully selected, but non-equally
spaced abscissas (Gaussian quadrature rules). The simplest example of a
Newton-Cotes type rule is the so-called trapezoidal rule:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (17)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath . To approximate an integral over a finite interval @xmath
with the help of this formula, one divides the interval into @xmath
sub-intervals of length @xmath and applies the trapezoidal rule to each
sub-interval. With the notation @xmath , one arrives at the compound
formula

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (18)
  -- -------- -- ------

with @xmath and @xmath for @xmath . Further

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (19)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is somewhere in the interval @xmath . Since the position of
the @xmath cannot be known without knowing the integral exactly, the
last term in Eq. ( 18 ) is usually neglected and introduces an error in
the numerical evaluation. This error is proportional to @xmath and one
has to evaluate the function @xmath roughly @xmath -times.
An improvement is given by Simpson’s rule, which evaluates the function
at three points:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (20)
  -- -------- -- ------

This yields the compound formula

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (21)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is an even number, @xmath , and for @xmath we have @xmath
if @xmath is odd and @xmath if @xmath is even. The error estimate scales
now as @xmath .
As mentioned earlier, there are also rules involving non-equally spaced
abscissas. A well known representative is the main formula of Gaussian
quadrature.
If @xmath is a weight function on @xmath , then there exist weights
@xmath and abscissas @xmath for @xmath such that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (22)
  -- -------- -- ------

with

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (23)
  -- -------- -- ------

The abscissas are given by the zeros of the orthogonal polynomial of
degree @xmath associated to the weight function @xmath . In order to
find them numerically, it is useful to know that they all lie in the
interval @xmath . The weights are given by the (weighted) integral over
the Lagrange polynomials:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (24)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the fundamental Lagrange polynomials are given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (25)
  -- -------- -- ------

#### 4.3 Monte Carlo techniques

Monte Carlo integration is one of the two methods to perform the
integrations in Chapters \ttitle and \ttitle , although we also present
only the results of CI. This is common for the evaluation of
multi-dimensional integrals. Generally speaking one is looking for an
algorithm that meets a certain set of properties. It should

-   give a numerical estimate of the integral together with an estimate
    of the error,

-   yield the result in a reasonable amount of time, e.g. at low
    computational cost,

-   be able to handle multidimensional integrals.

Monte Carlo integration delivers on all points of the list. In
particular, as will be shown later, its error scales like @xmath ,
independent of the number of dimensions. This makes Monte Carlo
integration the preferred method for integrals in high dimensions.

Another integrator provided by the Cuba-library [ 71 ] is “VEGAS”. It is
a Monte Carlo integrator paired with variance reducing techniques. These
two concepts shall be shown in the following subsection.
Quadrature rules are inefficient for multidimensional integrals.
Therefore one resorts to Monte Carlo integration. On the plus side, its
error scales like @xmath independent of the number of dimensions. But,
on the other hand, a convergence by a rate of @xmath is pretty slow. To
improve efficiency, variance reducing techniques like importance
sampling are employed.
Consider the integral of a function @xmath , depending on @xmath
variables @xmath over the unit hypercube @xmath . Furthermore, @xmath is
assumed to be square-integrable. From now on, the short-hand notation
@xmath and for the function evaluated at that point @xmath will be used.
The Monte Carlo estimate for the integral

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (26)
  -- -------- -- ------

is given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (27)
  -- -------- -- ------

The law of large numbers ensures that the Monte Carlo estimate converges
to the true value of the integral:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (28)
  -- -------- -- ------

The corresponding error @xmath reads

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (29)
  -- -------- -- ------

##### 4.3.1 Stratified sampling

This technique consists of dividing the full integration space into
subspaces, performing a Monte Carlo integration in each subspace, and
adding up partial results in the end. Mathematically, this is based on
the fundamental property of the Riemann integral

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (30)
  -- -------- -- ------

More generally, one splits the integration region @xmath into @xmath
regions @xmath where @xmath . In each region one performs a Monte Carlo
integration with @xmath points. For the integral @xmath , one obtains
the estimate

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (31)
  -- -------- -- ------

and instead of @xmath one has now the expression

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (32)
  -- -------- -- ------

If the subspaces and the number of points in each subspace are chosen
carefully, this can lead to a dramatic reduction in the error compared
with crude Monte Carlo, but it should be noted, that it can also lead to
a larger error if the choice is not appropriate. In general, the total
variance is minimized when the number of points in each sub-volume is
proportional to @xmath .

##### 4.3.2 Importance sampling

Mathematically, importance sampling corresponds to a change of
integration variables:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (33)
  -- -------- -- ------

with

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (34)
  -- -------- -- ------

If one restricts @xmath to be a positive-valued function @xmath and to
be normalized to unity

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (35)
  -- -------- -- ------

one may interpret @xmath as a probability density function. If one has a
random number generator corresponding to the distribution @xmath at his
disposal, one may estimate the integral from a sample @xmath of random
numbers distributed according to @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (36)
  -- -------- -- ------

The statistical error @xmath of the Monte Carlo integration is given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (37)
  -- -------- -- ------

It becomes evident that the relevant quantity is now @xmath and it will
be advantageous to choose @xmath as close in shape to @xmath as
possible. In practice, one chooses @xmath such that it approximates
@xmath reasonably well in shape and such that one can generate random
numbers distributed according to @xmath .
One disadvantage of importance sampling is the fact, that it is
dangerous to choose functions @xmath , which become zero, or which
approach zero quickly. If @xmath goes to zero where @xmath is not zero,
@xmath may be infinite and the usual technique of estimating the
variance from the sample points may not detect this fact if the region
where @xmath is small.

##### 4.3.3 The VEGAS-algorithm

The techniques described before require some advanced knowledge of the
behaviour of the function to be integrated. In many cases this
information is not available and one prefers adaptive techniques, e.g.
an algorithm which learns about the functions as it proceeds. In the
following, the VEGAS-algorithm will be presented. It combines the basic
ideas of importance sampling and stratified sampling into an iterative
algorithm, which automatically concentrates evaluations of the integrand
in those regions where the integrand is largest in magnitude. VEGAS
starts by subdividing the integration space into a rectangular grid and
performs an integration in each subspace. These results are then used to
adjust the grid for the next iteration according to where the integral
receives dominant contributions. In this way VEGAS uses importance
sampling and tries to approximate the optimal probability density
function

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (38)
  -- -------- -- ------

by a step function. Due to storage requirements one has to use a
separable probability density function in @xmath dimensions:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (39)
  -- -------- -- ------

Eventually after a few iterations the optimal grid is found. In order to
avoid rapid destabilizing changes in the grid, the adjustment of the
grid includes usually a damping term. After this initial exploratory
phase, the grid may be frozen and in a second evaluation phase the
integral may be evaluated with high precision according to the optimized
grid. The separation in an exploratory phase and an evaluation phase
allows one to use less integrand evaluations in the first phase and to
ignore the numerical estimates from this phase (which will in general
have a larger variance). Each iteration yields an estimate @xmath
together with an estimate for the variance @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (40)
  -- -------- -- ------

Here @xmath denotes the number of integrand evaluations on iteration
@xmath . The results of each iteration on the evaluation phase are
combined into a cumulative estimate, weighted by the number of calls
@xmath and their variances:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (41)
  -- -------- -- ------

If the error estimates @xmath become unreliable (for example if the
function is not square integrable), it is more appropriate to weight the
partial results by the number @xmath of integrand evaluations alone. In
addition VEGAS returns the @xmath per degree of freedom:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (42)
  -- -------- -- ------

This allows a check whether the various estimates are consistent. One
expects a @xmath not much greater than one.

## Chapter \thechapter Loop–Tree Duality at One–Loop

This chapter serves to introduce the Loop-Tree Duality method (LTD) [ 72
, 73 ] which we will be using subsequently throughout this thesis. It is
a technique to numerically calculate multi-leg one-loop cross-sections
in perturbative field theories. In fact, it is applicable in any quantum
field theory in Minkowsky space with an arbitrary number of space-time
dimensions. At its core, it establishes a relation between loop-level
and tree-level amplitudes similar to the Feynman Tree Theorem (FTT) [ 74
, 75 ] . Both methods allow to write basisc loop Feynman diagrams in
terms of tree-level phase-space integrals which are obtained by cutting
the original loop-integral. This is achieved by directly applying the
Residue Theorem ² ² 2 Within the context of loop integrals, the use of
the residue theorem has been considered many times in textbooks and in
the literature. . to the loop integrand. However, there are also some
inportant differences between them: While the LTD produces only single
cuts, the FTT also involves higher order cuts (double, triple, and so
forth).

In this chapter, we closely follow Refs. [ 48 , 49 ] ³ ³ 3 Ref. [ 48 ]
is a good introduction to the Duality relation. It gives further insight
into its nature and its comparison to the FTT. We refer the interested
reader to that paper. For the purpose of this thesis we will follow it
(and [ 49 ] ) only as far as necessary to understand the later chapters.
to illustrate and derive the Loop–Tree Duality.

### 5 Notation

The FTT and the LTD can be illustrated with no loss of generality by
considering their application to the basic ingredient of any one-loop
Feynman diagrams, namely a generic one-loop scalar integral @xmath with
@xmath ( @xmath ) external legs. In the following and throughout this
thesis, we assume the considered diagrams to be free from UV and IR
divergencies.

The momenta of the external legs are denoted by @xmath and are clockwise
ordered (Fig. 3 ). All are taken as outgoing. To simplify the notation
and the presentation, we also limit ourselves in the beginning to
considering massless internal lines only. Thus, the one-loop integral
@xmath can in general be expressed as:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (43)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the loop momentum (which flows anti-clockwise). The
momenta of the internal lines are denoted by @xmath ; they are given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (44)
  -- -------- -- ------

and momentum conservation results in the constraint

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (45)
  -- -------- -- ------

The value of the label @xmath of the external momenta is defined modulo
@xmath , i.e. @xmath .

The number of space-time dimensions is denoted by @xmath (the convention
for the Lorentz-indices adopted here is @xmath ) with metric tensor
@xmath . The space-time coordinates of any momentum @xmath are denoted
as @xmath , where @xmath is the energy (time component) of @xmath . It
is also convenient to introduce light-cone coordinates @xmath , where
@xmath . Throughout the chapter we consider loop integrals and
phase-space integrals. If the integrals are ultraviolet or infrared
divergent, we always assume that they are regularized by using analytic
continuation in the number of space-time dimensions (dimensional
regularization). Therefore, @xmath is not fixed and does not necessarily
have integer value.

We introduce the following shorthand notation:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (46)
  -- -------- -- ------

When we factorize off in a loop integral the integration over the
momentum coordinate @xmath or @xmath , we write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (47)
  -- -------- -- ------

and

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (48)
  -- -------- -- ------

respectively. The customary phase-space integral of a physical particle
with momentum @xmath (i.e. an on-shell particle with positive-definite
energy: @xmath , @xmath ) reads

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (49)
  -- -------- -- ------

where we have defined

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (50)
  -- -------- -- ------

Using this shorthand notation, the one-loop integral @xmath in Eq. ( 43
) can be cast into

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (51)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath denotes the customary Feynman propagator,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (52)
  -- -------- -- ------

We also introduce the advanced propagator @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (53)
  -- -------- -- ------

We recall that the Feynman and advanced propagators only differ in the
position of the particle poles in the complex plane (Fig. 4 ). Using
@xmath , we therefore have

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (54)
  -- -------- -- ------

and

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (55)
  -- -------- -- ------

Thus, in the complex plane of the variable @xmath (or, equivalently ⁴ ⁴
4 To be precise, each propagator leads to two poles in the plane @xmath
and to only one pole in the plane @xmath (or @xmath ). , @xmath ), the
pole with positive (negative) energy of the Feynman propagator is
slightly displaced below (above) the real axis, while both poles
(independently of the sign of the energy) of the advanced propagator are
slightly displaced above the real axis.

### 6 The Feynman Tree Theorem

In this section we briefly recall the FTT [ 74 , 75 ] . To this end, we
first introduce the advanced one-loop integral @xmath , which is
obtained from @xmath in Eq. ( 51 ) by replacing the Feynman propagators
@xmath with the corresponding advanced propagators @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (56)
  -- -------- -- ------

Then, we note that

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (57)
  -- -------- -- ------

The proof of Eq. ( 57 ) can be carried out in an elementary way by using
the Cauchy Residue Theorem and choosing a suitable integration path
@xmath . We have

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath                     
                                
              @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

The loop integral is evaluated by integrating first over the energy
component @xmath . Since the integrand is convergent when @xmath , the
@xmath integration can be performed along the contour @xmath , which is
closed at @xmath in the lower half-plane of the complex variable @xmath
(Fig. 5 – left ). The only singularities of the integrand with respect
to the variable @xmath are the poles of the advanced propagators @xmath
, which are located in the upper half-plane. The integral along @xmath
is then equal to the sum of the residues at the poles in the lower
half-plane and therefore it vanishes.

The advanced and Feynman propagators are related by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (59)
  -- -------- -- ------

which can straightforwardly be obtained by using the elementary identity

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (60)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath denotes the principal-value prescription. Inserting Eq. (
59 ) into the right-hand side of Eq. ( 56 ) and collecting the
contributions with an equal number of factors @xmath and @xmath , we
obtain a relation between @xmath and the one-loop integral @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (61)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- ------

Here, the single-cut contribution is given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (62)
  -- -------- -- ------

In general, the @xmath -cut terms @xmath @xmath are the contributions
with precisely @xmath delta functions @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (63)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the sum in the curly brackets includes all the permutations of
@xmath that give unequal terms in the integrand.

Recalling that @xmath vanishes, cf. Eq. ( 57 ), Eq. ( 61 ) results in:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (64)
  -- -------- -- ------

This equation is the FTT in the specific case of the one-loop integral
@xmath . The FTT relates the one-loop integral @xmath to the
multiple-cut ⁵ ⁵ 5 If the number of space-time dimensions is @xmath ,
the right-hand side of Eq. ( 64 ) receives contributions only from the
terms with @xmath ; the terms with larger values of @xmath vanish, since
the corresponding number of delta functions in the integrand is larger
than the number of integration variables. integrals @xmath . Each delta
function @xmath in @xmath replaces the corresponding Feynman propagator
in @xmath by cutting the internal line with momentum @xmath . This is
synonymous to setting the respective particle on shell. An @xmath
-particle cut decomposes the one-loop diagram in @xmath tree diagrams:
in this sense, the FTT allows us to calculate loop-level diagrams from
tree-level diagrams.

In view of the discussion in the following sections, it is useful to
consider the single-cut contribution @xmath on the right-hand side of
Eq. ( 64 ). In the case of single-cut contributions, the FTT replaces
the one-loop integral with the customary one-particle phase-space
integral, see Eqs. ( 49 ) and ( 62 ). Using the invariance of the
loop-integration measure under translations of the loop momentum @xmath
, we can perform the momentum shift @xmath in the term proportional to
@xmath on the right-hand side of Eq. ( 62 ). Thus, cf. Eq. ( 44 ), we
have @xmath and @xmath , with @xmath . We can repeat the same shift for
each of the terms @xmath in the sum on the right-hand side of Eq. ( 62
), and we can rewrite @xmath as a sum of @xmath basic phase-space
integrals (Fig. 6 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (65)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

We denote the basic one-particle phase-space integrals with @xmath
Feynman propagators by @xmath . They are defined as follows:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (66)
  -- -------- -- ------

The extension of the FTT from the one-loop integrals @xmath to one-loop
scattering amplitudes @xmath (or Green’s functions) in perturbative
field theories is straightforward, provided the corresponding field
theory is unitary and local . The generalization of Eq. ( 64 ) to
arbitrary scattering amplitudes is [ 74 , 75 ] :

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (67)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is obtained in the same way as @xmath , i.e. by starting
from @xmath and considering all possible replacements of @xmath Feynman
propagators @xmath of its loop internal lines with the ‘cut propagators’
@xmath .

The proof of Eq. ( 67 ) directly follows from Eq. ( 64 ): @xmath is a
linear combination of one-loop integrals that differ from @xmath only by
the inclusion of interaction vertices. As briefly recalled below, this
difference has harmless consequences on the derivation of the FTT.

Including particle masses in the advanced and Feynman propagators has an
effect on the location of the poles produced by the internal lines in
the loop. However, as long as the masses are real , as in the case of
unitary theories, the position of the poles in the complex plane of the
variable @xmath is affected only by a translation parallel to the real
axis, with no effect on the imaginary part of the poles. This
translation does not interfere with the proof of the FTT as given in
Eqs. ( 56 )–( 64 ). Therefore, the effect of a particle mass @xmath in a
loop internal line with momentum @xmath simply amounts to modifying the
corresponding on-shell delta function @xmath when this line is cut to
obtain @xmath . This modification then leads to the obvious replacement:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (68)
  -- -------- -- ------

Including interaction vertices has the effect of introducing numerator
factors in the integrand of the one-loop integrals. As long as the
theory is local, these numerator factors are at worst polynomials of the
integration momentum @xmath ⁶ ⁶ 6 This statement is not completely true
in the case of gauge theories and, in particular, in the case of
gauge-dependent quantities. For the discussion of the additional issues
that arise in gauge theories see Ref. [ 48 ] Section 9. . In the complex
plane of the variable @xmath , this polynomial behavior does not lead to
additional singularities at any finite values of @xmath . The only
danger, when using the Cauchy theorem as in Eq. ( 6 ) to prove the FTT,
stems from polynomials of high degree that can spoil the convergence of
the @xmath -integration at infinity. Nonetheless, if the field theory is
unitary, these singularities at infinity never occur since the degree of
the polynomials in the various integrands is always sufficiently limited
by the unitarity constraint.

### 7 The Loop–Tree Duality

In this Section we derive and illustrate the Loop–Tree Duality relation
between one-loop integrals and single-cut phase-space integrals. This
relation is the main general result of this chapter.

Rather than starting from @xmath , we directly apply the Residue Theorem
to the computation of @xmath . We proceed exactly as in Eq. ( 6 ), and
obtain

  -- -------- -- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath                        (69)
                                   
                 @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -- -------- -------- ------

At variance with @xmath , each of the Feynman propagators @xmath has
single poles in both the upper and lower half-planes of the complex
variable @xmath (see Fig. 5 – right ) and therefore the integral does
not vanish as in the case of the advanced propagators. In contrast,
here, the @xmath poles in the lower half-plane contribute to the
residues in Eq. ( 69 ).

The calculation of these residues is elementary, but it involves several
subtleties. The detailed calculation, including a discussion of its
subtle points, is presented in the following.

The sum over residues in Eq. ( 69 ) receives contributions from @xmath
terms, namely the @xmath residues at the poles with negative imaginary
part of each of the propagators @xmath , with @xmath , see Eq. ( 54 ).
Considering the residue at the @xmath -th pole we write

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (70)
  -- -------- -- ------

where we have used the fact that the propagators @xmath , with @xmath ,
are not singular at the value of the pole of @xmath . Therefore, they
can be directly evaluated at this value.

Applying the Residue Theorem in the complex plane of the variable @xmath
, the computation of the one-loop integral @xmath reduces to the
evaluation of the residues at @xmath poles, according to Eqs. ( 69 ) and
( 70 ).

The evaluation of the residues in Eq. ( 70 ) is a key point in the
derivation of the Loop–Tree Duality relation. To make this point as
clear as possible, we first introduce the notation @xmath to explicitly
denote the location of the @xmath -th pole, i.e. the location of the
pole with negative imaginary part (see Eq. ( 54 )) that is produced by
the propagator @xmath . We further simplify our notation with respect to
the explicit dependence on the subscripts that label the momenta. We
write @xmath , where @xmath depends on the loop momentum while @xmath is
a linear combination of the external momenta (see Eq. ( 44 )).
Therefore, to carry out the explicit computation of the @xmath -th
residue in Eq. ( 70 ), we re-label the momenta by @xmath and @xmath ,
and we simply evaluate the term

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (71)
  -- -------- -- ------

where (see Eq. ( 54 ))

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (72)
  -- -------- -- ------

In the next paragraphs, separately compute the residue of @xmath and its
pre-factor – the associated factor arising from the propagators @xmath .

The computation of the residue of @xmath gives

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (73)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

thus leading to the result in Eq. ( 74 ). Note that the first equality
in the second line of Eq. ( 73 ) is obtained by removing the @xmath
prescription from the previous expression. This is fully justified. The
term @xmath becomes singular when @xmath , and this corresponds to an
end-point singularity in the integration over @xmath : therefore the
@xmath prescription has no regularization effect on such end-point
singularity. The second equality in the second line of Eq. ( 73 ) simply
follows from the definition of the on-shell delta function @xmath ,
which we will later call the dual delta function.

Hence, the calculation of the residue of @xmath gives

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (74)
  -- -------- -- ------

This result shows that considering the residue of the Feynman propagator
of the internal line with momentum @xmath is equivalent to cutting that
line by including the corresponding on-shell propagator @xmath . The
subscript @xmath of @xmath refers to the on-shell mode with positive
definite energy, @xmath : the positive-energy mode is selected by the
Feynman @xmath prescription of the propagator @xmath . The insertion of
Eq. ( 74 ) in Eq. ( 69 ) directly leads to a representation of the
one-loop integral as a linear combination of @xmath single-cut
phase-space integrals.

We now consider the evaluation of the residue pre-factor (the second
square-bracket factor in Eq. ( 71 )). We first recall that the @xmath
prescription of the Feynman propagators has played an important role in
the application (see Eqs. ( 69 ) and ( 71 )) of the Residue Theorem to
the computation of the loop integral: having selected the pole with
negative imaginary part, @xmath , the prescription eventually singled
out the on-shell mode with positive definite energy, @xmath (see Eq. (
73 )). However, the evaluation of the one-loop integrals by the direct
application of the Residue Theorem (as in Eq. ( 69 )) involves some
subtleties. The subtleties mainly concern the correct treatment of the
Feynman @xmath prescription in the calculation of the residue
pre-factors. A consistent treatment requires the strict computation of
the residue pre-factor in Eq. ( 71 ): the @xmath prescription in both
@xmath and @xmath has to be dealt with by considering the imaginary part
@xmath as a finite , though possibly small, quantity; the limit of
infinitesimal values of @xmath has to be taken only at the very end of
the computation, thus leading to the interpretation of the ensuing
@xmath prescription as mathematical distribution. Applying this strict
procedure, we obtain

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (75)
  -- -------- -- ------

The last equality on the first line of Eq. ( 75 ) simply follows from
setting @xmath in the expression on the square-bracket (note, in
particular, that @xmath ). The first equality on the second line follows
from @xmath (i.e. from expanding @xmath at small values of @xmath ).

The result in Eq. ( 75 ) for the residue pre-factor is well-defined and
leads to a well-defined (i.e. non singular) expression once it is
inserted in Eq. ( 69 ). The possible singularities from each of the
propagators @xmath are regularized by the displacement produced by the
associated imaginary amount @xmath . Performing the limit of
infinitesimal values of @xmath , only the sign of the @xmath
prescription (and not its actual magnitude) is relevant. Therefore,
since @xmath is positive, in Eq. ( 75 ) we can perform the replacement
@xmath , where @xmath is a future-like vector with

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (76)
  -- -------- -- ------

i.e. a @xmath -dimensional vector that can be either light-like @xmath
or time-like @xmath with positive definite energy @xmath . Hence, we
finally obtain

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (77)
  -- -------- -- ------

After reintroducing the original labels of the momenta of the loop
integral according to the replacements @xmath , @xmath , see the
discussion above Eq. ( 71 ), the calculation of the residue pre-factor
on the r.h.s. of Eq. ( 70 ) yields

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (78)
  -- -------- -- ------

Note that the calculation of the residue at the pole of the internal
line with momentum @xmath changes the propagators of the other lines in
the loop integral. Although the propagator of the @xmath -th internal
line still has the customary form @xmath , its singularity at @xmath is
regularized by a different @xmath prescription: the original Feynman
prescription @xmath is modified in the new prescription @xmath , which
we name the ‘dual’ @xmath prescription or, briefly, the @xmath
prescription. The dual @xmath prescription arises from the fact that the
original Feynman propagator @xmath is evaluated at the complex value of
the loop momentum @xmath , which is determined by the location of the
pole at @xmath . The @xmath dependence from the pole has to be combined
with the @xmath dependence in the Feynman propagator to obtain the total
dependence as given by the dual @xmath prescription. The presence of the
vector @xmath is a consequence of using the Residue Theorem. To apply it
to the calculation of the @xmath dimensional loop integral, we have to
specify a system of coordinates (e.g. space-time or light-cone
coordinates) and select one of them to be integrated over at fixed
values of the remaining @xmath coordinates. Introducing the auxiliary
vector @xmath with space-time coordinates @xmath , the selected system
of coordinates can be denoted in a Lorentz-invariant form. Applying the
Residue Theorem in the complex plane of the variable @xmath at fixed
(and real ) values of the coordinates @xmath and @xmath (to be precise,
in Eq. ( 69 ) we actually used @xmath ), we obtain the result in Eq. (
78 ).

The @xmath dependence of the ensuing @xmath prescription is thus a
consequence of the fact that the residues at each of the poles are not
Lorentz-invariant quantities. The Lorentz-invariance of the loop
integral is recovered only after summing over all the residues.

Inserting the results of Eq. ( 70 )–( 78 ) in Eq. ( 69 ) we directly
obtain the Duality relation between one-loop integrals and phase-space
integrals:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (79)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the explicit expression of the phase-space integral @xmath is
(Fig. 7 )

  -- -------- -------- -- ------
     @xmath   @xmath      (80)
              @xmath      (81)
  -- -------- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the auxiliary vector defined in Eq. ( 76 ). Each of the
@xmath propagators in the integrand is regularized by the dual @xmath
prescription and, thus, it is named ‘dual’ propagator. Note that the
momentum difference @xmath is independent of the integration momentum
@xmath : it only depends on the momenta of the external legs (see Eq. (
44 )).

Using the invariance of the integration measure under translations of
the momentum @xmath , we can perform the same momentum shifts as
described in Section 6 . In analogy to Eq. ( 65 ), we can rewrite Eq. (
80 ) as a sum of @xmath basic phase-space integrals (Fig. 7 ):

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (82)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

The basic one-particle phase-space integrals with @xmath dual
propagators are denoted by @xmath , and are defined as follows:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (83)
  -- -------- -- ------

We now comment on the comparison between the FTT (Eqs. ( 62 )–( 66 ))
and the Loop–Tree Duality (Eqs. ( 79 )–( 83 )). The multiple-cut
contributions @xmath , with @xmath , of the FTT are completely absent
from the Loop–Tree Duality relation, which only involves single-cut
contributions similar to those in @xmath . However, the Feynman
propagators present in @xmath are replaced by dual propagators in @xmath
. This compensates for the absence of multiple-cut contributions in the
Loop–Tree Duality.

The @xmath prescription of the dual propagator depends on the auxiliary
vector @xmath . The basic dual contributions @xmath are well defined for
arbitrary values of @xmath . However, when computing @xmath , the
future-like vector @xmath has to be the same across all dual
contributions (propagators): only then @xmath does not depend on @xmath
.

In our derivation of the Loop–Tree Duality relation, the auxiliary
vector @xmath originates from the use of the Residue Theorem.
Independently of its origin, we can comment on the role of @xmath in the
Duality relation. The one-loop integral @xmath is a function of the
Lorentz-invariants @xmath . This function has a complicated analytic
structure, with pole and branch-cut singularities (scattering
singularities), in the multidimensional space of the complex variables
@xmath . The @xmath prescription of the Feynman propagators selects a
Riemann sheet in this multidimensional space and, thus, it unambiguously
defines @xmath as a single-valued function. Each single-cut contribution
to @xmath has additional (unphysical) singularities in the
multidimensional complex space. The dual @xmath prescription fixes the
position of these singularities. The auxiliary vector @xmath correlates
the various single-cut contributions in @xmath , so that they are
evaluated on the same Riemann sheet: this leads to the cancellation of
the unphysical single-cut singularities. In contrast, in the FTT, this
cancellation is produced by the introduction of the multiple-cut
contributions @xmath .

We remark that the expression ( 82 ) of @xmath as a sum of dual
contributions is just a matter of notation: for massless internal
particles @xmath is actually a single phase-space integral whose
integrand is the sum of the terms obtained by cutting each of the
internal lines of the loop. In explicit form, we can write:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (84)
  -- -------- -- ------

where the function @xmath is the integrand of the dual contribution in
Eq. ( 83 ). Therefore, the Loop–Tree Duality relation ( 79 ) directly
expresses the one-loop integral as the phase-space integral of a
tree-level quantity. To name Eq. ( 79 ), we have introduced the term
‘duality’ precisely to point out this direct relation ¹ ¹ 1 The word
duality also suggests a stronger (possibly one-to-one) correspondence
between dual integrals and loop integrals, which is further discussed in
Ref. [ 73 ] Sect. 7. between the @xmath -dimensional integral over the
loop momentum and the @xmath -dimensional integral over the one-particle
phase-space. For the FTT, the relation between loop-level and tree-level
quantities is more involved, since the multiple-cut contributions @xmath
(with @xmath ) contain integrals of expressions that correspond to the
product of @xmath tree-level diagrams over the phase-space for different
number of particles.

The simpler correspondence between loops and trees in the context of the
Loop–Tree Duality relation is further exploited in Ref. [ 73 ] Sect. 10,
where the Green’s functions and scattering amplitudes are discussed.

### 8 Explicit example: The scalar two-point function

In this Section we illustrate the application of the Loop–Tree Duality
relation to the evaluation of the one-loop two-point function @xmath . A
detailed discussion (including a comparison between FTT and Loop–Tree
Duality as well as detailed results in analytic form and numerical
results) of higher-point functions is found in [ 48 ] (see also Ref. [
72 ] ).

The two-point function (Fig. 8 ), also known as bubble function @xmath ,
is the simplest non-trivial one-loop integral with massless internal
lines:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (85)
  -- -------- -- ------

Here, we have visibly implemented momentum conservation @xmath and
exploited Lorentz invariance ( @xmath can only depend on @xmath , which
is the sole available invariant). Since most of the one-loop
calculations have been carried out in four-dimensional field theories
(or in their dimensionally-regularized versions), we set @xmath . Note,
however, that we present results for arbitrary values of @xmath or,
equivalently, for any value @xmath of space-time dimensions.

The result of the one-loop integral in Eq. ( 85 ) is well known:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (86)
  -- -------- -- ------

where @xmath is the customary @xmath -dimensional volume factor that
appears from the calculation of one-loop integrals:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (87)
  -- -------- -- ------

We recall that the @xmath prescription in Eq. ( 86 ) follows from the
corresponding prescription of the Feynman propagators in the integrand
of Eq. ( 85 ). The @xmath prescription defines @xmath as a single-value
function of the real variable @xmath . In particular, it gives @xmath an
imaginary part with an unambiguous value when @xmath :

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (88)
  -- -------- -- ------

#### 8.1 General form of single-cut integrals

To apply the Loop–Tree Duality relation, we have to compute the
single-cut integrals @xmath and @xmath , respectively. Since these
integrals only differ because of their @xmath prescription, we introduce
a more general regularized version, @xmath , of the single-cut integral.
We define:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (89)
  -- -------- -- ------

Although @xmath is an arbitrary function of @xmath , @xmath only depends
on the sign of the @xmath prescription, i.e. on the sign of the function
@xmath : setting @xmath we recover @xmath , cf. Eq. ( 66 ), while
setting @xmath we recover @xmath (see Eq. ( 83 )).

The calculation of the integral in Eq. ( 89 ) is elementary, and the
result is

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (90)
  -- -------- -- ------

Note that the typical volume factor, @xmath , of the @xmath -dimensional
phase-space integral is

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (91)
  -- -------- -- ------

The factor @xmath in Eq. ( 90 ) originates from the difference between
@xmath and the volume factor @xmath of the loop integral:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (92)
  -- -------- -- ------

We also note that the result in Eq. ( 90 ) depends on the sign of the
energy @xmath . This follows from the fact that the integration measure
in Eq. ( 89 ) has support on the future light-cone, which is selected by
the positive-energy requirement of the on-shell constraint @xmath .

The denominator contribution @xmath in the integrand of Eq. ( 89 ) is
positive definite in the kinematical region where @xmath and @xmath . In
this region the @xmath prescription is inconsequential, and @xmath has
no imaginary part. Outside this kinematical region, @xmath can vanish,
leading to a singularity of the integrand. The singularity is
regularized by the @xmath prescription, which also produces a
non-vanishing imaginary part. The result in Eq. ( 90 ) explicitly shows
these expected features, since it can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------
     @xmath   @xmath                     (93)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ------

We note that the functions @xmath and @xmath have different analyticity
properties in the complex @xmath plane. The bubble function has a
branch-cut singularity along the positive real axis, @xmath . The
phase-space integral @xmath has a branch-cut singularity along the
entire real axis if @xmath , while the branch-cut singularity is placed
along the negative real axis if @xmath .

#### 8.2 Duality relation for the two-point function

We now consider the Loop–Tree Duality (Fig. 9 ) in the context of this
example. The dual representation of the one-loop two-point function is
given by

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (94)
  -- -------- -- ------

cf. Eqs. ( 82 ) and ( 83 ). The dual contribution @xmath is obtained by
setting @xmath in Eq. ( 90 ). Since @xmath is a future-like vector,
@xmath has the following important property:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (95)
  -- -------- -- ------

Using this property, the result in Eq. ( 90 ) can be written as

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (96)
  -- -------- -- ------

Comparing this expression with Eq. ( 86 ), we see that the imaginary
contribution in the square bracket is responsible for the difference
with the two-point function. However, since @xmath , this contribution
is odd under the exchange @xmath and, therefore, it cancels when Eq. (
96 ) is inserted in Eq. ( 94 ). Taken together,

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (97)
  -- -------- -- ------

which fully agrees with the Duality relation @xmath .

### 9 Loop–Tree Duality with generic masses

This section serves to recapitulate the chapter and give the explicit
formulae for generic masses as well as some explicit example
calculations to illustrate how the Loop–Tree Duality works in practice.

#### 9.1 Generic masses

The Feynman propagators @xmath in Eq. ( 43 ) with real internal masses
@xmath read:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (98)
  -- -------- -- ------

The derivation of the Loop–Tree Duality Theorem is exactly the same
regardless of the internal lines being massive or massless ( @xmath ),
as long as the masses are real. Non–vanishing internal real masses only
account for a displacement of the poles of the propagators along the
real axis, which does not change the derivation of the Duality Theorem,
as will become obvious in the following. Moreover, they do not alter the
relationship between Feynman, advanced, retarded and dual propagators,
which is the basis of both, the Duality Theorem as a duality to the FTT.
Besides the customary Feynman propagators @xmath , we also encounter
advanced, @xmath , and retarded, @xmath , propagators, defined by:

  -- -------- -- ------
     @xmath      (99)
  -- -------- -- ------

The Feynman, advanced, and retarded propagators only differ in the
position of the particle poles in the complex plane. Using @xmath , we
therefore find the poles of the Feynman and advanced propagators in the
complex plane of the variable @xmath at:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (100)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus, the pole with positive/negative energy of the Feynman propagator
is slightly displaced below/above the real axis, while both poles of the
advanced/retarded propagator, independently of the sign of the energy,
are slightly displaced above/below the real axis (cf. Fig. 4 ).
Similarly to the massless case, we further define

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (101)
  -- -------- -- -------

where again the subscript @xmath of @xmath refers to the on–shell mode
with positive definite energy, @xmath . Hence, the phase–space integral
of a physical particle with momentum @xmath , i.e., an on–shell particle
with positive–definite energy, @xmath , @xmath , reads:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (102)
  -- -------- -- -------

In order to derive the Duality Theorem, one directly applies the Residue
Theorem to the computation of @xmath in Eq. ( 43 ): Each of the Feynman
propagators @xmath has single poles in both the upper and lower
half–planes of the complex variable @xmath . Since the integrand is
convergent when @xmath , by closing the contour at @xmath in the lower
half–plane and applying the Cauchy theorem, the one–loop integral
becomes the sum of @xmath contributions, each of them obtained by
evaluating the loop integral at the residues of the poles with negative
imaginary part belonging to the propagators @xmath . The calculation of
the residue of @xmath gives

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (103)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath defined in Eq. ( 101 ). This result shows that considering
the residue of the Feynman propagator of the internal line with momentum
@xmath is equivalent to cutting that line by including the corresponding
on–shell propagator @xmath . The propagators @xmath , with @xmath , are
not singular at the value of the pole of @xmath and can therefore be
directly evaluated at this point, yielding to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (104)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (105)
  -- -------- -- -------

is (massive) dual propagator with @xmath a future–like vector, defined
as in ( 76 ). i.e., a @xmath –dimensional vector that can be either
light–like @xmath or time–like @xmath with positive definite energy
@xmath and @xmath . Collecting the results from Eq. ( 103 ) and Eq. (
104 ), the Loop–Tree Duality Theorem at one–loop takes the final form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (106)
  -- -------- -- -------

#### 9.2 Explicit example

Here we present a very simple yet fully featured example of a triangle
graph with generic internal masses. The integral to calculate is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (107)
  -- -------- -- -------

with the three Feynman propagators

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (108)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath according to the conventions
established in Section 5 . Applying Duality means using Eq. ( 80 ) to
rewrite the integral @xmath . A triangle has three internal lines, thus
@xmath . Integral @xmath takes the form:

  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath         
     @xmath   @xmath         
     @xmath   @xmath         (109)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------

Each summand of Eq. ( 80 ) is a dual contribution. In the first dual
contribution the line carrying @xmath gets cut, i.e. it becomes a dual
delta function, i.e. @xmath . The Feynman propagators that correspond to
the other internal line get promoted to a dual propagators as in Eq. (
81 ). The first argument of the dual propagator indicates the cut, the
second one the momentum of the internal line it is assigned to.
In order to produce dual contribution two, the next internal line (the
one associated with @xmath ) gets cut, and all of the other lines (=
lines carrying @xmath and @xmath ) converted to dual propagators,
similarly to the first dual contribution.
To evaluate the dual delta functions we take advantage of

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (110)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath are the zeros of @xmath . Hence the dual deltas yield:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath               
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (111)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

There is a crucial difference to note: The dual delta functions @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath force the zero component of the loop integration to
different values. For example, in contribution one we have @xmath
whereas in contribution three the zero component is fixed to @xmath .
This will heavily affect the structure of the dual contributions. Now we
can insert for the dual propagators and apply the dual delta functions.
To give the reader a better idea of how the outcome looks we write down
contribution three, which we will call @xmath , explicitly:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      (112)
              @xmath      
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

The other two dual contributions look very similar. This is the final
result that we obtain from using the Loop-Tree Duality. We see that it
is a phase-space integration which runs only over the loop three
momenta. We could now put numbers for @xmath and @xmath and perform an
actual calculation. Therefore we would pass the integral to a numerical
integrator as we will do in Chapter \ttitle . In fact, Section 25.2
shows the results for this exact triangle that we have discussed here.

## Chapter \thechapter Loop–Tree Duality beyond One–Loop

In the previous chapter, the Loop–Tree Duality method was introduced for
the one-loop case. It has the appealing property of recasting the
virtual corrections in a from which is very similar to the real ones,
thus giving rise to the idea of directly combining the two. In the
introduction, this Duality relation has been derived for the one–loop
case. The purpose of this chapter is twofold.
First we want to establish a better-suited notation which then in turn
allows the generalization of the Duality Theorem to situations involving
two-loops. Therefore, a systematic procedure is presented which can be
employed repeatedly to cover diagrams with even more loops. For the
scope of this thesis it is sufficient to illustrate the technique at the
two–loop level. Readers who are interested in applying it beyond
two-lops are advised to check Ref. [ 49 ] .
Second, this chapter helps to prepare to following one, in which we will
be dealing with higher order poles. At the one–loop level, these can be
avoided through an adequate choice of gauge, however, at two–loops this
no longer the case.

### 10 Duality relation at one–loop

It was shown in Chapter \ttitle that using the Cauchy residue theorem
the one–loop integral can be written in the form:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (113)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (114)
  -- -------- -- -------

is the so–called dual propagator, as defined in Ref. [ 48 ] , with
@xmath a future–like vector,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (115)
  -- -------- -- -------

The extension of the Duality Theorem to two loops has been discussed in
detail in [ 49 , 76 ] . Here we recall the basic points. We extend the
definition of propagators of single momenta to combinations of
propagators of sets of internal momenta. Let @xmath be any set of
internal momenta @xmath with @xmath . We then define Feynman and dual
propagator functions of this set @xmath in the following way:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (116)
  -- -------- -- -------

By definition, @xmath , when @xmath and thus consists of a single four
momentum. At one–loop order, @xmath is naturally given by all internal
momenta of the diagram which depend on the single integration loop
momentum @xmath , @xmath . However, let us stress that @xmath can in
principle be any set of internal momenta. At higher order loops, e.g.,
several integration loop momenta are needed, and we can define several
loop lines @xmath to label all the internal momenta (cf. Eq. ( 126 ))
where Eq. ( 116 ) will be used for these loop lines or unifications of
these. We also define:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (117)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the sign in front of @xmath indicates that we have reversed the
momentum flow of all the internal lines in @xmath . For Feynman
propagators, moreover, @xmath . Using this notation the following
relation holds for any set of internal momenta @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (118)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the advanced propagator:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (119)
  -- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (120)
  -- -------- -- -------

The proof of Eq. ( 118 ) can be found in Ref. [ 49 ] . Note that
individual terms in @xmath depend on the dual vector @xmath , but the
sum over all terms contributing to @xmath is independent of it. Another
crucial relation for the following is given by a formula that allows to
express the dual function of a set of momenta in terms of chosen
subsets. Considering the following set @xmath , where @xmath is the
unification of various subsets @xmath , we can obtain the relation:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (121)
  -- -------- -- -------

The sum runs over all partitions of @xmath into exactly two blocks
@xmath and @xmath with elements @xmath , where, contrary to the usual
definition, we include the case: @xmath , @xmath . For the case of
@xmath , e.g., where @xmath , we have:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (122)
  -- -------- -- -------

Naturally it holds that:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (123)
  -- -------- -- -------

Since in general relation ( 121 ) holds for any set of basic elements
@xmath which are sets of internal momenta, one can look at these
expressions in different ways, depending on the given sets and subsets
considered. If we define, for example, the basic subsets @xmath to be
given by single momenta @xmath , and since in that case @xmath , Eq. (
121 ) then denotes a sum over all possible differing m–tuple cuts for
the momenta in the set @xmath , while the uncut propagators are Feynman
propagators. These cuts start from single cuts up to the maximal number
of cuts given by the term where all the propagators of the considered
set are cut. Using this notation, the Duality Theorem at one–loop can be
written in the compact form:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (124)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath as in Eq. ( 44 ) labels all internal momenta @xmath . In
this way, we directly obtain the Duality relation between one–loop
integrals and single–cut phase–space integrals and hence Eq. ( 124 ) can
also be interpreted as the application of the Duality Theorem to the
given set of momenta @xmath . It obviously agrees, at one loop, with
Eq. ( 113 ).

### 11 Duality relation at two–loops

We now turn to the general two–loop master diagram, as presented in
Figure 10 . Again, all external momenta @xmath are taken as outgoing,
and we have @xmath , with momentum conservation @xmath . The label
@xmath of the external momenta is defined modulo @xmath , i.e., @xmath .
In the two–loop case, unlike at the one–loop order, the number of
external momenta might differ from the number of internal momenta. The
loop momenta are @xmath and @xmath , which flow anti–clockwise and
clockwise respectively. The momenta of the internal lines are denoted by
@xmath and are explicitly given by

  -- -- -- -------
           (125)
  -- -- -- -------

where @xmath , with @xmath , are defined as the set of lines,
propagators respectively, related to the momenta @xmath , for the
following ranges of @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (126)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the following, we will use @xmath for denoting a set of indices or
the set of the corresponding internal momenta synonymously. Furthermore,
we will refer to these lines often simply as the “loop lines”.

We shall now extend the Duality theorem to the two–loop case, by
applying Eq. ( 124 ) iteratively. We consider first, in the most general
form, a set of several loop lines @xmath to @xmath depending on the same
integration momentum @xmath , and find

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (127)
  -- -------- -- -------

which states the application of the Duality Theorem, Eq. ( 124 ), to the
set of loop lines belonging to the same loop. Eq. ( 127 ) is the
generalization of the Duality Theorem found at one–loop to a single loop
of a multi–loop diagram. Each subsequent application of the Duality
Theorem to another loop of the same diagram will introduce an extra
single cut, and by applying the Duality Theorem as many times as the
number of loops, a given multi–loop diagram will be opened to a
tree–level diagram. The Duality Theorem, Eq. ( 127 ), however, applies
only to Feynman propagators, and a subset of the loop lines whose
propagators are transformed into dual propagators by the application of
the Duality Theorem to the first loop might also be part of another loop
(cf., e.g., the “middle” line belonging to @xmath in Fig. 10 ). The dual
function of the unification of several subsets can be expressed in terms
of dual and Feynman functions of the individual subsets by using Eq. (
121 ) (or Eq. ( 122 )), and we will use these expressions to transform
part of the dual propagators into Feynman propagators, in order to apply
the Duality Theorem to the second loop. Therefore, applying Eq. ( 127 )
to the loop with loop momentum @xmath , reexpressing the result via
Eq. ( 122 ) in terms of dual and Feynman propagators and applying Eq. (
127 ) to the second loop with momentum @xmath , we obtain the Duality
relation at two loops in the form:

  -- -- -------- -- -------
        @xmath      (128)
        @xmath      
  -- -- -------- -- -------

This is the dual representation of the two–loop scalar integral as a
function of double–cut integrals only, since all the terms of the
integrand in Eq. ( 128 ) contain exactly two dual functions as defined
in Eq. ( 116 ). The integrand in Eq. ( 128 ) can then be reinterpreted
as the sum over tree–level diagrams integrated over a two–body
phase–space.

The integrand in Eq. ( 128 ), however, contains several dual functions
of two different loop lines, and hence dual propagators whose dual
@xmath prescription might still depend on the integration momenta. This
is the case for dual propagators @xmath where each of the momenta @xmath
and @xmath belong to different loop lines. If both momenta belong to the
same loop line the dependence on the integration momenta in @xmath
obviously cancels, and the complex dual prescription is determined by
external momenta only. The dual prescription @xmath can thus, in some
cases, change sign within the integration volume, therefore moving up or
down the position of the poles in the complex plane. To avoid this, we
should reexpress the dual representation of the two–loop scalar integral
in Eq. ( 128 ) in terms of dual functions of single loop lines. This
transformation was unnecessary at one–loop because at the lowest order
all the internal momenta depend on the same integration loop momenta; in
other words, there is only a single loop line.

Inserting Eq. ( 122 ) in Eq. ( 128 ) and reordering some terms, we
arrive at the following representation of the two–loop scalar integral

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (129)
     @xmath      
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (130)
  -- -------- -- -------

In Eq. ( 129 ), the @xmath prescription of all the dual propagators
depends on external momenta only. Through Eq. ( 130 ), however, Eq. (
129 ) contains also triple cuts, given by the contributions with three
@xmath . The triple cuts are such that they split the two–loop diagram
into two disconnected tree–level diagrams. By definition, however, the
triple cuts are such that there is no more than one cut per loop line
@xmath . Since there is only one loop line at one–loop, it is also clear
why we did not generate disconnected graphs at this loop order. For a
higher number of loops, we expect to find at least the same number of
cuts as the number of loops, and topology-dependent disconnected tree
diagrams built by cutting up to all the loop lines @xmath . These
results can be generalized at three–loops and beyond without any
additional effort. The reader is referred to [ 49 ] for further details.

## Chapter \thechapter Loop–Tree Duality beyond Simple Poles

In the previous chapters, the derivation of the Duality relied on having
only simple poles in the loop integral, i.e. it was only applicable to
Feynman graphs that do not feature identical propagators. At one–loop
this situation can always be avoided by a convenient choice of gauge [
48 ] , but for two–loop and higher order corrections this isn’t the case
anymore. Hence, in this chapter we first want to address the issue of
higher order poles. We will see that a straightforward application of
the Residue Theorem similar to the one–loop case is feasible but leads
to complex expressions. Therefore a second, more elegant, way is shown
which involves the use of Integration By Parts (IBP) relations.

### 12 Duality relation for multiple poles

In the previous chapter we applied the Residue Theorem to one– and
two–loop graphs that contain only single poles, i.e. no identical
propagators. At one–loop this is always the case for a suitable choice
of gauge [ 48 ] . However, at higher loops there exists the possibility
of identical propagators, i.e. higher order poles [ 1 ] . Obviously, we
need to generalize the Duality Theorem to accommodate for such graphs.
The first occurrence of higher order poles is at the two–loop level,
with the sole double pole generic graph shown in Fig. 11 . The Duality
Theorem can be derived for such graphs as well, using the Residue
Theorem for multiple poles

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (131)
  -- -------- -- -------

The derivation follows similar steps as with the single pole case and is
independent of any particular coordinate system. We will derive an
expression both in Cartesian and light–cone coordinates, to demonstrate
this independence. We start with the cartesian system. We write the
Feynman propagator in a form that makes the poles explicit, i.e,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (132)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the position of the pole. Then, applying the Residue
Theorem by selecting poles with negative imaginary part, we have

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (133)
  -- -------- -- -------

The imaginary component of the new denominator @xmath is irrelevant,
because it is always a positive quantity. We refer the reader to [ 48 ]
where the calculation for the case of simple poles is explained in more
detail. Then, we assume the following Lorentz-invariant prescription of
the residue

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (134)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is a future-like vector, @xmath , in Cartesian coordinates.
Contrary to the one–loop case, where numerators depending on the loop
momentum do not modify the Duality prescription, in the two–loop and
higher orders cases the derivative in the residue calculation introduced
by the higher order poles act on every single term in the numerator and
also on the remaining propagators. Let @xmath be a function of a set of
momenta @xmath , with @xmath . Then the residue of a double pole is
given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (135)
  -- -------- -- -------

which can be written as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (136)
  -- -------- -- -------

In light–cone coordinates we choose our coordinates such that in the
plus component complex plane the poles with negative imaginary part are
located at:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (137)
  -- -------- -- -------

In these light–cone coordinates the Feynman propagator reads:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (138)
  -- -------- -- -------

and thus

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (139)
  -- -------- -- -------

which, at first sight, seems to contradict equation Eq. ( 134 ). This
contradiction can be resolved by taking into account the fact that in
light cone coordinates, the dual vector @xmath is light-like and
therefore @xmath . Hence equation Eq. ( 134 ) remains valid. Now, we are
ready to calculate the residue of a double pole in light cone
coordinates:

  -- -------- -- -------
                 
     @xmath      (140)
  -- -------- -- -------

where now @xmath . Eq. ( 12 ) has the same functional form as in Eq. (
12 ), although with a different dual vector @xmath . Thus we can
generalize Eq. ( 12 ) and Eq. ( 12 ) to an arbitrary coordinate system
and combining simple and double poles in a single formula we get in
Cartesian coordinates:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      
              @xmath      (141)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Equation ( 141 ), is the main result of this section. It extends the
Duality Theorem to integrals with identical propagators or, to put it
differently, with double poles in the complex plane. For the case of the
generic two–loop graph in Fig. 11 , this result can be seen as an
extension of Eq. ( 122 ). If we have two groups of momenta, @xmath , one
of which contains the double propagator, i.e. @xmath and @xmath , and we
denote by @xmath a group that contains all the momenta of @xmath leading
to single poles, namely
@xmath , then we can write:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (142)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

This result states that for the case of a double pole, one follows the
usual procedure of cutting every propagator line once, including the
double propagator, and transforming the rest of the propagators to dual
propagators. A similar formula can be derived for the case of multiple
(triple and higher) poles. The calculation of the residue of a multiple
pole introduces, however, contributions with powers of dual propagators.
In absence of a general transformation formula analogous to Eq. ( 121 ),
it is not possible to rewrite Eq. ( 141 ) in terms of dual propagators
whose dual @xmath prescription depends on the external momenta only. For
that reason, we will present in the next section a different strategy
for dealing with higher order poles based on the reduction of the
integral using Integration By Parts.

### 13 Reducing to single poles with IBPs

In this section, we discuss a different approach to the generalization
of the Duality Theorem to higher order poles. We will use Integration By
Parts (IBP) [ 77 , 78 ] to reduce the integrals with multiple poles to
ones with simple poles. We emphasize the fact the we do not need to
reduce the integrals to a particular integral basis . We just need to
reduce them ”enough”, so that the higher order poles disappear.

To give a short introduction to the method and establish our notation,
let us consider a general @xmath –loop scalar integral in @xmath
dimensions, with @xmath denominators @xmath raised to exponents @xmath
and external momenta @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (143)
  -- -------- -- -------

If we notice that

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (144)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , the integrand being a total derivative with respect to
the loop momenta, we can find relations between scalar integrals with
different exponents @xmath . This will allow us to express integrals
with exponents larger than one, in terms of simpler ones. In effect, we
will be able to write integrals with multiple poles in terms of sums of
integrals with simple poles. In the numerator of the integrand of Eq. (
144 ) we can use @xmath , to obtain a system of equations that relate
the various integrals. For simplicity, when referring to an IBP we will
use the shorthand notation:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (145)
  -- -------- -- -------

to denote Eq. ( 144 ). The differentiation will raise or leave an
exponent unchanged, while, contractions with the loop and external
momenta in the numerator of the integrand, can be expressed in terms of
the propagators to lower an exponent. Often times though, this is not
possible, leaving scalar products of momenta, which cannot be expressed
in terms of denominators. These are called Irreducible Scalar Products
(ISP). We will consider ISPs as additional denominators, @xmath , with a
negative index @xmath . We use the notation:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (146)
  -- -------- -- -------

to denote a generic two–loop integral with @xmath propagators raised to
an arbitrary integer power, with @xmath and @xmath denotes any
combination of external and loop momenta. In the following the
prescription @xmath for the propagators is understood. We will use the
symbol @xmath to denote the raising of the index @xmath by one i.e.
@xmath and the symbol @xmath to denote the lowering of the index @xmath
by one i.e. @xmath . A combination of the two means that the operators
apply at the same time i.e. @xmath . In the following we will use two
automated codes, for the reduction, FIRE [ 79 ] , a MATHEMATICA package
for the reduction of integrals and REDUZE 2 [ 80 ] ² ² 2 Since the most
obvious first approach seems to be to try to express the integrals with
multiple poles in terms of the same integrals with only single poles,
c.f. Eq. ( 148 ), we used, in addition to the “usual” version of REDUZE
2 , in some cases a special patch for REDUZE 2 which provides a
modification of its integral ordering in the final result. This modified
version of REDUZE 2 delivered the results for the integrals in this
desired form stated in the subsequent sections, while we used the normal
version of the integral ordering for the remaining cases. Note that we
also calculated explicitly the relations obtained from the modified
version, in the easiest cases of the massless two– and three–loop
integrals which can be built by insertion of the the massless one–loop
two–point function, and found agreement. , a package written in C++,
using GiNaC [ 81 ] .

#### 13.1 The case for two–loop diagrams

The only generic two–loop scalar graph with @xmath -legs and a double
propagator is shown in Fig. 11 . The simplest case is the two–point
function with massless internal lines. The denominators are:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where we have introduced an ISP as an additional denominator ³ ³ 3 For
REDUZE 2 the corresponding propagator is added and used as input
instead. . For the rest of this section the prescription @xmath for the
propagators is understood. In our notation, the integral we want to
reduce is @xmath and to this end we use the six total derivatives

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (147)
  -- -------- -- -------

Applying these IBPs on @xmath we get a system of recursive equations.
Using specific values for the exponents @xmath we can solve this system
and obtain @xmath . For this particular case, we solve the system
explicitly and the reader is referred to the Appendix \ttitle for
details. Finally we arrive at:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (148)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , a result which contains only single poles and can be
treated using the Duality Theorem [ 49 ] . For the rest of the cases
below and in the three–loop case in the next section, we have used FIRE
and REDUZE 2 to perform the reductions and check our results. For three
external legs @xmath and massless internal lines, we have the
denominators:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

where the last two are the ISPs that appear in this case. The integral
we want to reduce is @xmath . We use eight IBPs:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (149)
  -- -------- -- -------

A similar analysis to the one above, gives:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (150)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , which, again contains only single poles and can be
treated with the Duality Theorem.

The inclusion of masses does not affect the general picture of the
reduction. It solely introduces numerators in some integrals after the
reduction is done. But, as we have stressed already, the application of
the Duality Theorem is not affected by numerators since it only operates
on denominators [ 49 ] . As an illustrative example, let us consider the
two–loop graph with two external legs and one massive loop (see Fig. 11
). For the case of the left loop being massive (related to @xmath ),
with mass @xmath , the denominators involved are

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

with the addition of the irreducible scalar product

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (151)
  -- -------- -- -------

needed to perform the reduction. Using the same IBPs of Eq. ( 147 ), the
result of the reduction, with FIRE is:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (152)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

with @xmath and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (153)
  -- -------- -- -------

The reduction generates two integrals with a numerator, namely

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

but the double poles have now disappeared. The result with REDUZE 2
reads:

  -- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- --

where @xmath is given by Eq. ( 153 ). Despite the appearance of
different integrals the two results are of course equivalent. This is
because, the integrals @xmath and @xmath , in the result obtained with
FIRE , are identical (as can be seen by shifting the loop momenta), so
the sum of their coefficients gives exactly the coefficient of the
result obtained with REDUZE 2 . The same argument applies for the
integrals @xmath and @xmath . The appearance of the numerators does not
affect the application of the Duality Theorem for integrals with single
poles as was detailed in [ 49 ] . For the case of the right loop in Fig.
11 being massive (related to @xmath ), we have the denominators:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using the IBPs from Eq. ( 147 ), we get with FIRE :

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (155)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

and with REDUZE 2 :

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (156)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

For the case of the double pole, two–loop graph, with three external
legs and one massive loop, we have the denominators:

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

  -- -------- --
     @xmath   
  -- -------- --

Using the IBPs from Eq. ( 149 ) we get with FIRE :

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (157)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , and:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (158)
  -- -------- -- -------

while, with REDUZE 2 , we get:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (159)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (160)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

and

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (161)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

The cases with additional external legs can be treated in a similar
manner. It can always be reduced to sums of integrals with single
propagators at the expense of introducing numerators. Although no formal
proof exists, in all cases studied so far it has been possible to reduce
to integrals where only single poles appear. The generality of this
result seems plausible [ 82 ] .

Our strategy is now clear. For a two–loop calculation, first we reduce
all double pole graphs using IBPs or any other method. The remaining
integrals all contain single poles and can be treated using the Duality
Theorem at two–loops. The appearance of vector or tensor integrals does
not spoil this strategy since the Duality Theorem for single poles,
affects only the denominators of the integrands.

#### 13.2 The case for three–loop diagrams

For three–loop graphs there exists one topology with a triple propagator
and a number of topologies with a double propagator. All topologies are
shown in Fig. 12 . The arguments for the two–loop case are valid here as
well. We first reduce the multiple pole integrands by using IBPs until
we have integrals with only single poles (possibly with numerators) and
then we can then apply single-pole Duality Theorem as it was described
for the three–loop case in Ref. [ 49 ] . In the following, we show
explicitly the reduction of the two-point function for the different
topologies and for massless internal lines. We use the notation:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (162)
  -- -------- -- -------

to denote a generic three–loop integral with @xmath propagators raised
to an arbitrary integer power, with @xmath or @xmath equal to any ISP
and @xmath any combination of external and loop momenta. We also have
@xmath . The IBPs to be used for the reduction are:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (163)
  -- -------- -- -------

In the following, we present first the result obtained with REDUZE 2 and
then with FIRE . For the single triple pole graph (a) in Fig. ( 12 ), we
have the following expressions:

  (a)  

    The denominators used are:

      -- -------- --

The difference between the results of FIRE on the one hand and REDUZE 2
on the other is due to the fact that the second is expressed in terms of
basis integrals while the first is expressed in terms of integrals with
single poles of the same type as the multiple pole integral (in effect
the first result can be further reduced to the second). Since we do not
seek a particular basis for our reduction, as was stressed earlier, both
results are equally useful as far as application of the Duality Theorem
is concerned.

### 14 Conclusions

We have extended the Duality Theorem to two– and three–loop integrals
with multiple poles. A Lorentz–invariant expression for the residues of
double poles has been derived, which can be extended straightforwardly
to triple and, in general, multiple poles. In the absence of a
systematic procedure to reexpress dual propagators in terms of Feynman
propagators (cf. Eq. ( 121 ) for the case of simple poles) we have
explored an alternative approach. We use IBP identities to reduce the
integrals with identical propagators to ones with only single poles.
Therefore, the essential features of the Loop–Tree Duality now remain
intact. We reiterate that our goal is not to reduce everything to some
set of master integrals. Rather, we reduce the integrals until there are
no multiple poles left. Then, we can use the Duality Theorem in its
original form for single pole propagators, to rewrite them as integrals
of a tree–level object over a modified phase-space. The appearance of
additional tensor integrals, due to the reduction, does not affect our
procedure, since applying the Duality Theorem in its single-pole
version, only cuts propagators, leaving the numerators of the integrals
unaffected.

## Chapter \thechapter On the Cancellation of Singularities

In the previous chapters the Loop–Tree Duality was extended to cover
Feynman diagrams which involve multiple loops as well as higher order
poles [ 49 , 1 ] .
Keeping in mind that the final aim of the Loop–Tree Duality is to treat
virtual and real corrections at the same time. In this chapter we
analyse the singular behaviour of one-loop integrals and scattering
amplitudes in the framework of the Loop–Tree Duality method. We begin
with a discussion of the cancellation of singularities among dual
contributions at the integrand level. After that, we present a phase
space mapping between virtual corrections in the dual representation and
the real corrections for the local cancellation of infrared
divergencies.

### 15 The singular behaviour of the loop integrand

We consider a general one-loop @xmath -leg scalar integral

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (172)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (173)
  -- -------- -- -------

are Feynman propagators that depend on the loop momentum @xmath , which
flows anti-clockwise, and the four-momenta of the external legs @xmath ,
@xmath , which are taken as outgoing and are ordered clockwise. We use
dimensional regularization with @xmath the number of space-time
dimensions. The momenta of the internal lines @xmath , where @xmath is
the energy (time component) and @xmath are the spacial components, are
defined as @xmath with @xmath , and @xmath by momentum conservation. We
also define @xmath .

The loop integrand becomes singular in regions of the loop momentum
space in which subsets of internal lines go on-shell, although the
existence of singular points of the integrand is not enough to ensure
the emergence in the loop integral of divergences in the dimensional
regularization parameter. Nevertheless, numerical integration over
integrable singularities still requires a contour deformation [ 83 , 84
, 85 , 86 , 87 , 88 , 89 , 90 ] , namely, to promote the loop momentum
to the complex plane in order to smoothen the loop matrix elements in
the singular regions of the loop integrand. Hence, the relevance to
identify accurately all the integrand singularities.

In Cartesian coordinates, the Feynman propagator in Eq. ( 173 ) becomes
singular at hyperboloids with origin in @xmath , where the minimal
distance between each hyperboloid and its origin is determined by the
internal mass @xmath . This is illustrated in Fig. 13 , where for
simplicity we work in @xmath space-time dimensions. Figure 13 (left)
shows a typical kinematical situation where two momenta, @xmath and
@xmath , are separated by a time-like distance, @xmath , and a third
momentum, @xmath , is space-like separated with respect to the other
two, @xmath and @xmath . The on-shell forward hyperboloids ( @xmath )
are represented in Fig. 13 by solid lines, and the backward hyperboloids
( @xmath ) by dashed lines. For the discussion that will follow it is
important to stress that Feynman propagators become positive inside the
respective hyperboloid and negative outside. Two or more Feynman
propagators become simultaneously singular where their respective
hyperboloids intersect. In most cases, these singularities, due to
normal or anomalous thresholds [ 91 , 92 ] of intermediate states, are
integrable. However, if two massless propagators are separated by a
light-like distance, @xmath , then the overlap of the respective
light-cones is tangential, as illustrated in Fig. 13 (right), and leads
to non-integrable collinear singularities. In addition, massless
propagators can generate soft singularities at @xmath .

As we have seen in Chapter \ttitle , the dual representation of the
scalar one-loop integral in Eq. ( 43 ) is the sum of @xmath dual
integrals [ 48 , 49 ] :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (174)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (175)
  -- -------- -- -------

are the so-called dual propagators, as defined in Ref. [ 48 ] , with
@xmath a future-like vector, @xmath , with positive definite energy
@xmath . The delta function @xmath sets the internal lines on-shell by
selecting the pole of the propagators with positive energy @xmath and
negative imaginary part. In the following we take @xmath , and thus
@xmath . This is equivalent to performing the loop integration along the
on-shell forward hyperboloids. Let us mention that in the light-cone
coordinates ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ), where @xmath , Feynman
propagators vanish at hyperboloids in the plane ( @xmath , @xmath )
which are similar to those depicted in Fig. 13 but rotated by 45
degrees. Consequently, by selecting the forward hyperboloids the
integration limits of either @xmath or @xmath are restricted and the
restrictions are different for each dual contribution. For this reason,
although Eq. ( 174 ) is valid for any system of coordinates, we will
stick for the rest of the thesis to Cartesian coordinates where all the
dual contributions share the same integration limits for the loop
three-momentum.

A crucial point of our discussion is the observation that dual
propagators can be rewritten as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (176)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (177)
  -- -------- -- -------

is the loop energy measured along the on-shell hyperboloid with origin
at @xmath . By definition we have @xmath . The factor @xmath can become
singular for @xmath , but the integral @xmath is still convergent by two
powers in the infrared. Soft singularities require two dual propagators,
where each of the two dual propagators contributes with one power in the
infrared. From Eq. ( 176 ) it is obvious that dual propagators become
singular, @xmath , if one of the following conditions is fulfilled:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (178)
     @xmath      (179)
  -- -------- -- -------

The first condition, Eq. ( 178 ), is satisfied if the forward
hyperboloid of @xmath intersects with the backward hyperboloid of @xmath
. The second condition, Eq. ( 179 ), is true when the two forward
hyperboloids intersect each other.

In the massless case, Eq. ( 178 ) and Eq. ( 179 ) are the equations of
conic sections in the loop three-momentum space; @xmath and @xmath are
the distance to the foci located at @xmath and @xmath , respectively,
and the distance between the foci is @xmath . If internal masses are
non-vanishing, Eq. ( 177 ) can be reinterpreted as the distance
associated to a four-dimensional space with one “massive” dimension and
the foci now located at @xmath and @xmath , respectively. Then, the
singularity arises at the intersection of the conic sections given by
Eq. ( 178 ) or Eq. ( 179 ) in this generalized space with the zero mass
plane. This picture is useful to identify the singular regions of the
loop integrand in the loop three-momentum space.

The solution to Eq. ( 178 ) is an ellipsoid and clearly requires @xmath
. Moreover, since it is the result of the intersection of a forward with
a backward hyperboloid the distance between the two propagators has to
be future-like, @xmath . Actually, internal masses restrict this
condition. Bearing in mind the image of the conic sections in the
generalized massive space so we can deduce intuitively that Eq. ( 178 )
has solution for

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (180)
  -- -------- -- -------

The second equation, Eq. ( 179 ), leads to a hyperboloid in the
generalized space, and there are solutions for @xmath either positive or
negative, namely when either of the two momenta are set on-shell.
However, by interpreting the result in the generalized space it is clear
that the intersection with the zero mass plane does not always exist,
and if it exists, it can be either an ellipsoid or a hyperboloid in the
loop three-momentum space. Here, the distance between the momenta of the
propagators has to be space-like, although also time-like configurations
can fulfill Eq. ( 179 ) as far as the time-like distance is small or
close to light-like. The following condition is necessary:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (181)
  -- -------- -- -------

In any other configuration, the singularity appears for loop
three-momenta with imaginary components.

### 16 Cancellation of singularities among dual integrands

In this section we prove one of the main properties of the Loop–Tree
Duality method, namely the partial cancellation of singularities among
different dual integrands. This represents a significant advantage with
respect to the integration of regular loop integrals in the @xmath
-dimensional space, where one single integrand cannot obviously lead to
such cancellation.

Let us consider first two Feynman propagators separated by a space-like
distance, @xmath (or more generally fulfilling Eq. ( 181 )). In the
corresponding dual representation one of these propagators is set
on-shell and the other becomes dual, and the integration occurs along
the respective on-shell forward hyperboloids. See again Fig. 13 (left)
for a graphical representation of this set-up. There, the two forward
hyperboloids of @xmath and @xmath intersect at a single point.
Integrating over @xmath along the forward hyperboloid of @xmath we find
that the dual propagator @xmath , which is negative below the
intersection point where the integrand becomes singular, changes sign
above this point as we move from outside to inside the on-shell
hyperboloid of @xmath . The opposite occurs if we set @xmath on-shell;
@xmath is positive below the intersection point, and negative above. The
change of sign leads to the cancellation of the common singularity.
Notice that also the dual @xmath prescription changes sign. In order to
prove analytically this cancellation, we define @xmath . In the limit
@xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (182)
  -- -------- -- -------

and thus the leading singular behaviour cancels among the two dual
contributions. The cancellation of these singularities is not altered by
the presence of other non-vanishing dual propagators (neither by
numerators) because

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (183)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we have used the identity @xmath . If instead, the separation is
time-like (in the sense of Eq. ( 180 )), we define @xmath , and find

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (184)
  -- -------- -- -------

In this case the singularity of the integrand remains because of the
Heaviside step function.

We should consider also the case in which more than two propagators
become simultaneously singular. To analyse the intersection of three
forward hyperboloids, we define

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (185)
  -- -------- -- -------

As before, we use the identity @xmath , and thus @xmath . In the limit
in which the three propagators become simultaneously singular:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (186)
  -- -------- -- -------

and again the leading singular behaviour cancels in the sum. Although
not shown for simplicity in Eq. ( 186 ), also the @xmath terms cancel in
the sum, thus rendering the integrand finite in the limit @xmath . For
three propagators there are also more possibilities: two forward
hyperboloids might intersect simultaneously with a backward hyperboloid,
or two backward hyperboloids might intersect with a forward hyperboloid.
In the former case, we define @xmath , and @xmath , with @xmath and
@xmath , and hence @xmath . In the @xmath limit

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (187)
  -- -------- -- -------

Notice that the singularity in @xmath cancels in Eq. ( 187 ) (also at
@xmath ). In the latter case, we set as before @xmath , and define
@xmath , then

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      
     @xmath      (188)
  -- -------- -- -------

Similarly, it is straightforward to prove that four forward hyperboloids
do not lead to any common singularity and more generally that the
remaining multiple singularities are only driven by propagators that are
time-like connected and less energetic than the propagator which is set
on-shell.

Thus, we conclude that singularities of space-like separated propagators
⁴ ⁴ 4 Including light-like and time-like configurations such that Eq. (
181 ) is fulfilled. , occurring in the intersection of on-shell forward
hyperboloids, are absent in the dual representation of the loop
integrand. The cancellation of these singularities at the integrand
level already represents a big advantage of the Loop–Tree Duality with
respect to the direct integration in the four-dimensional loop space; it
makes unnecessary the use of contour deformation to deal numerically
with the integrable singularities of these configurations. This
conclusion is also valid for loop scattering amplitudes. Moreover, this
property can be extended in a straightforward manner to prove the
partial cancellation of infrared singularities.

Collinear singularities occur when two massless propagators are
separated by a light-like distance, @xmath . In that case, the
corresponding light-cones overlap tangentially along an infinite
interval. Assuming @xmath , however, the collinear singularity for
@xmath appears at the intersection of the two forward light-cones, with
the forward light-cone of @xmath located inside the forward light-cone
of @xmath , or equivalently, with the forward light-cone of @xmath
located outside the forward light-cone of @xmath , Thus, the singular
behaviour of the two dual components cancel against each other,
following the same qualitative arguments given before. For @xmath ,
instead, it is the forward light-cone of @xmath that intersects
tangentially with the backward light-cone of @xmath according to Eq. (
178 ). The collinear divergences survive in this energy strip, which
indeed also limits the range of the loop three-momentum where infrared
divergences can arise. If there are several reference momenta separated
by light-like distances the infrared strip is limited by the minimal and
maximal energies of the external momenta. The soft singularity of the
integrand at @xmath leads to soft divergences only if two other
propagators, each one contributing with one power in the infrared, are
light-like separated from @xmath . In Fig. 13 (right) this condition is
fulfilled only at @xmath , but not at @xmath neither at @xmath .

In summary, both threshold and infrared singularities are constrained in
the dual representation of the loop integrand to a finite region where
the loop three-momentum is of the order of the external momenta.
Singularities outside this region, occurring in the intersection of
on-shell forward hyperboloids or light-cones, cancel in the sum of all
the dual contributions.

### 17 Cancellation of infrared singularities with real corrections

Having constrained the loop singularities to a finite region of the loop
momentum space, we discuss now how to map this region into the
finite-size phase-space of the real corrections for the cancellation of
the remaining infrared singularities. The use of collinear factorization
and splitting matrices, encoding the collinear singular behaviour of
scattering amplitudes as introduced in Ref. [ 93 , 94 ] , is suitable
for this discussion.

We consider the interference of the one-loop scattering amplitude @xmath
with the corresponding @xmath -parton tree-level scattering amplitude
@xmath , which is integrated with the appropriate phase-space factor

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (189)
  -- -------- -- -------

where we assume that only the external momentum @xmath is incoming (
@xmath ). Then, we select the corresponding dual contribution with the
internal massless line @xmath on-shell

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (190)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where the loop energy in Eq. ( 190 ) is restricted by the energy of the
adjacent external massless particle @xmath to select the infrared
sector, according to the discussion of the previous sections. We also
consider the @xmath -parton tree-level scattering amplitude

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (191)
  -- -------- -- -------

where an extra particle is radiated from parton @xmath , with @xmath ,
and the complementary scattering amplitude @xmath that contains all the
tree-level contributions with the exception of those already included in
@xmath . The corresponding interference, integrated over the phase-space
of the final-state particles, is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (192)
  -- -------- -- -------

For the simplicity of the presentation, we do not consider explicitly in
this section the square of @xmath , which is related with a self-energy
insertion in an external leg and whose infrared divergences are removed
by wave-function renormalization [ 48 ] . The final-state external
momenta of the loop and tree amplitudes in Eq. ( 190 ) and Eq. ( 192 ),
although labelled with the same indices, are constrained by different
phase-space momentum conservation delta functions. A mapping between the
primed (real amplitudes) and unprimed (virtual amplitudes) momenta is
necessary to show the cancellation of collinear divergences.

In the limit where @xmath and @xmath become collinear the dual one-loop
matrix element @xmath in Eq. ( 190 ) factorizes as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (193)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the reduced matrix element @xmath is obtained by replacing the two
collinear partons of @xmath by a single parent parton with light-like
momentum

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (194)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath a light-like vector, @xmath . Similarly, in the limit where
@xmath and @xmath become collinear the tree-level matrix element @xmath
factorizes as

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (195)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath , and

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (196)
  -- -------- -- -------

is the light-like momentum of the parent parton. A graphical
representation of the collinear limit of both virtual and real
corrections is illustrated in Fig. 14 . This graph suggests that in the
collinear limit the mapping between the four-momenta of the virtual and
real matrix elements should be such that @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath in the collinear limit. Notice that @xmath is restricted by
momentum conservation but @xmath is not. However, the relevant infrared
region is bound by @xmath in Eq. ( 190 ). This restriction allows to map
@xmath to @xmath . The mapping, nevertheless, is not as obvious as can
be induced from Fig. 14 as the propagators that become singular in the
collinear limit in the virtual and real matrix elements are different.
Reconsidering @xmath as the parent parton momentum of the collinear
splitting, we find the following relation between splitting matrices
entering the real matrix elements

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (197)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . We show now that the factor @xmath is compensated by the
phase-space. By introducing the following identity in the phase-space of
the real corrections

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (198)
  -- -------- -- -------

and performing the integration over the three-momentum @xmath and the
energy component of @xmath , the real phase-space becomes

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (199)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the factor @xmath equals unity in the collinear limit.
Inserting Eq. ( 193 ) in Eq. ( 190 ), and Eq. ( 195 ), Eq. ( 197 ) and
Eq. ( 199 ) in Eq. ( 192 ) the loop and tree contributions show to have
a very similar structure with opposite sign and match each other at the
integrand level in the collinear limit. Correspondingly, soft
singularities at @xmath can be treated consistently as the endpoint
limit of the collinear mapping.

### 18 Conclusions and outlook

The Loop–Tree Duality method exhibits attractive theoretical aspects and
nice properties which are manifested by a direct physical interpretation
of the singular behaviour of the loop integrand. Integrand singularities
occurring in the intersection of on-shell forward hyperboloids or
light-cones cancel among dual contributions. The remaining
singularities, excluding UV divergences, are found in the intersection
of forward with backward on-shell hyperboloids or light-cones and are
produced by dual propagators that are light-like or time-like separated
and less energetic than the internal propagator that is set on-shell.
Therefore, these singularities can be interpreted in terms of causality
and are restricted to a finite region of the loop three-momentum space,
which is of the size of the external momenta. As a result, a local
mapping at the integrand level is possible between one-loop and
tree-level matrix elements to cancel soft and collinear divergences. One
can anticipate that a similar analysis at higher orders of the Loop–Tree
Duality relation is expected to provide equally interesting results. We
leave this analysis for future work.

## Chapter \thechapter Multi-leg Scalar Integrals

After all these theoretical foundations haven been established in the
previous chapters, let us turn to an actual numerical implementation. We
have written a computer program in C++ to give a practical
proof-of-concept of the theoretical framework, and to be used for the
calculation of one-loop diagrams. The program at its current state will
serve as the basis of any further developments. The specifics of the
program are given in Section 25.1 . For the moment let us add here that
from the point of view of a dual integral, calculating a phase–space
point in the absence of threshold singularities is comparatively easy.
Things become more challenging for points with complex results, because
these feature singularities that do not cancel among dual contributions
which means they have to be dealt with by contour deformation. Since the
energy component is already fixed due the prior application of the
Residue Theorem, a dual integral and consequently the contour
deformation lives only in three spatial dimensions.

### 19 Preparation of the Numerical Implementation

The goal is to calculate a one-loop scalar integral in its dual
representation:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (200)
  -- -------- -- -------

Therefore, the program relies on a set of fundamental equations. These
shall be presented here. Since the program shall work for generic
masses, we need, as a first ingredient, the massive dual propagator

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (201)
  -- -------- -- -------

However, in practice we will make use of its rewritten form as in Eq. (
176 )

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (202)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (203)
  -- -------- -- -------

This means actually, that the integration to perform is a
three-dimensional one, because @xmath where @xmath is the loop
three-momentum and @xmath the sum of the external three-momenta up to
the i-th. The zero-component has already been integrated out as
explained in Chapter \ttitle and as a result the @xmath -component is
fixed according to Eq. ( 203 ). This is indicated by the presence of the
delta function @xmath .
The next ingredient is given by

  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath         (204)
     @xmath   @xmath         (205)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------

These two equations are used to identify the type of singularity that we
are dealing with. In Section 21 we will see how they come into play.

### 20 The Mapping

We use Cuhre and VEGAS from the Cuba library [ 71 ] as numerical
integrators. Cuhre is a deterministic integrator that uses cubature
rules and performs well as long as the dimensionality of the integral is
not too high. As stated before, dual integrals are only
three-dimensional making Cuhre an excellent choice for the task. VEGAS
on the other hand, is a Monte Carlo-integrator that uses importance
sampling for variance reduction. While it is much slower, it is useful
to crosscheck results and most probably will be used in later stages
when real and virtual corrections are combined.
Both integrators have in common that they assume the integration region
to be the unit cube. Hence, in order to perform an integral over the
entire phase-space, we must find a mapping @xmath .
The first and easiest option that comes to mind is simply rescaling
every dimension. One possible mapping to do so is

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (206)
  -- -------- -- -------

When @xmath , the argument of the tangent goes to @xmath and the tangent
of it to @xmath , when @xmath , the argument goes to @xmath and the
tangent of it to @xmath .
However, with regard to program stability it is advantageous to choose a
mapping that relies on the use of spherical coordinates. In fact, it is
a two-step process: In the first step the Cartesian coordinates @xmath
running from @xmath to @xmath get mapped to @xmath and @xmath , with
@xmath being the radius, @xmath azimuth and @xmath the polar angle,
respectively.

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (207)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

In the second step these get mapped to @xmath .

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (208)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

Despite seeming more complex at first glance, it is actually slightly
faster. Of course, every change of variables demands the inclusion of
the corresponding Jacobian.

### 21 Singular behaviour of dual contributions

Dual integrals feature certain types of singularities. This has already
been thoroughly discussed in Section 16 , thus, in this section, we want
to quickly recapitulate the parts that are going to be relevant to a
numerical implementation. For generic masses, the loop integrand becomes
singular at on-shell hyperboloids with @xmath (forward-hyperboloids,
solid lines of Fig. 13 ) and @xmath (backward-hyperboloids, dashed lines
of Fig. 13 ). The origins of the corresponding on-shell hyperboloids are
at @xmath . There are two main types of singularities to distinguish:

-   Forward-foward intersection. In Fig. 13 , these are the
    singularities that correspond to the intersection of two solid
    lines. They cancel among dual contributions. In short, the reason is
    the following (for more details, see Section 16 ): Propagators are
    positive inside and negative outside. When integrating along the
    forward-hyperboloids, every singularity is passed twice. One time
    going from the inside to the outside (or vice versa) and the second
    time from the outside to the inside (or vice versa). The crucial
    point is that therefore, the contributions coming from the two
    integrations have opposite sign and thus cancel out.
    The situation for this type of singularity is drawn in Fig. 15 ,
    once in loop three–momentum space ( 14(b) ) and for easier
    legibility in two dimensions ( 14(a) ). The surface (curve)
    represents all points for which the dual propagator in consideration
    has a pole. The dots indicate the positions of the foci ( @xmath )
    as introduced in Chapter \ttitle .

-   Forward-backward intersection. These singularities originate from
    the intersection of a solid with a dashed line in Fig. 13 . They
    remain and require to be dealt with by contour deformation. In
    Section 23 we will see how this is done.
    In Fig. 16 , the shapes of the surfaces at which propagators with
    such a singularity become infinite are illustrated. Again we show
    the actual loop three–momentum space plot (Figure 15(b) ) alongside
    a simpler two-dimensional version (Fig. 15(a) ).

Because Fig. 13 is only a two-dimensional plot these singularities show
up as mere points. In reality, i.e. in @xmath dimensions (with the
expression @xmath , dimensions, we refer to a Minkowski space with 1
time and @xmath spacial dimensions), these singularities have the shape
of hyperboloids or ellipsoids, respectively, as has been shown in Fig.
14(b) and 15(b) . Therefore, we will call them hyperboloid or ellipsoid
singularities from now on.

### 22 Interplay of dual contributions

Loop–Tree Duality transforms one-loop integrals into so-called dual
integrals:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (209)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath a set of internal momenta belonging to the same loop.
Symbolically speaking, we could express Duality with the following
scheme:

Each line in the matrix-like structure on the right side of the arrow of
Fig. 17 represents a dual contribution whereas the columns give the
number of the corresponding external leg. This scheme can now be used to
indicate the positions of the different singularities in a dual
integral. Consider the following small example, in which zero means no
singularity, H stands for hyperboloid singularity and E for ellipsoid
singularity:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (210)
  -- -------- -- -------

The correct interpretation would be: There is a one-loop box integral,
hence we have four dual contributions. On the main diagonal we have only
zeros because the dual delta functions cannot produce hyperboloid or
ellipsoid singularities. The first dual contribution has two hyperboloid
singularities, namely at positions two and four, the second dual
contribution has hyperboloid singularities at positions one and three
and an ellipsoid singularity at position four. The third dual
contribution has two ellipsoid singularities at positions one and four
and one hyperboloid singularity at position two and the fourth dual
contribution has only one hyperboloid singularity at position one. This
way of denoting singularities will become useful momentarily.
There is one further observation to make: Apparently the hyperboloid
singularities are distributed symmetrically around the main diagonal.
This is not by accident. Going back to Section 15 we have Eq. ( 179 )
which is the defining equation for hyperboloid singularities. Due to its
symmetry under the exchange of @xmath ( @xmath counts dual
contributions) and @xmath ( @xmath counts leg positions) the hyperboloid
singularities always appear in pairs and are distributed symmetrically
around the main diagonal of ( 210 ). Inspecting Eq. ( 178 ), which is
the defining equation for ellipsoid singularities, we see that this
equation is not symmetric under the exchange of indices. Thus for every
ellipsoid singularity in 210 we have a zero as its counterpart.
In Section 21 , and with more detail in Section 16 , we established that
hyperboloid singularities cancel among dual contributions and therefore
do not need to be treated via contour deformation. Yet they impact the
way we have to deform. In order to preserve the cancellation of
hyperboloid singularities, dual contributions featuring the same
hyperboloid singularity (pair) must receive the same deformation. To
further illustrate this point, let us look at the following pentagon
example:

In Fig. 18 , contributions one, two and three are coupled via their
common hyperboloid singularities. Thus, they need to receive the very
same deformation that accounts for all ellipsoid singularities occurring
within those contributions. These are found at position four of the
second contribution and positions one and four of the third
contribution. The fourth dual contribution is not coupled to any other
contribution and can be deformed as standalone. The fifth contribution
does not require any treatment.
As a general strategy, one organizes the dual contributions into groups.
A group is a set of pairwisely coupled contributions. Each of the groups
is deformed independently from the others. Within a group every
contribution receives the same deformation that accounts for all the
ellipsoids of the group.
Turning back to the example of Fig. 18 , we would have three groups: the
first group involves contributions one to three, the second group
constitutes of contribution four and the third group constitutes of
contribution five.

### 23 Contour deformation

The ellipsoid singularities (forward-backward type) lie on the real
axis. To avoid them, we need to deform the integration path into the
imaginary space.

#### 23.1 A one-dimensional example

To motivate the basic concept of contour deformation, let us have a look
at the following simple example. The function

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (211)
  -- -------- -- -------

has poles at @xmath . Simply integrating along the real axis would lead
to infinities. Therefore, an integration path that goes around the
singular points is needed. One possible way to achieve this would be:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (212)
  -- -------- -- -------

The parameter @xmath serves to scale the deformation along the imaginary
axis. At the position of the pole, the exponent becomes @xmath and thus
the exponential function hits its maximum, which is @xmath . Far away
from the poles the exponent is a large negative number, hence
exponentiating it suppresses the deformation.

#### 23.2 Deformation in three dimensions

Every valid deformation must satisfy a certain set of requirements [ 87
] :

1.  The deformation has to respect the @xmath -prescription of the
    propagator:
    In general, a ( @xmath -dimensional) contour deformation has the
    form:

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (213)
      -- -------- -- -------

    where @xmath usually is a function of the loop momentum @xmath . In
    our case, we want to perform the integration over a product of dual
    propagators. Plugging the deformation of Eq. ( 213 ) into the
    on-shell energy (Eq. ( 203 )), we obtain

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (214)
      -- -------- -- -------

    The Feynman prescription @xmath tells us in which direction to
    deform when coming close to a singularity. Hence, any valid
    deformation must match this prescription. Consequently, we need to
    have

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (215)
      -- -------- -- -------

2.  The deformation should vanish at infinity:
    We are looking for a deformation that does not change the actual
    value of the integral. Therefore, we do not want @xmath to grow for
    @xmath . An easy way to satisfy this condition is to choose @xmath
    such that @xmath as @xmath . ⁵ ⁵ 5 Strictly speaking, there is a
    third condition:
    The deformation must vanish at the position of soft or collinear
    singularities:
    This point is of importance for the matching of soft and collinear
    singularities between real and virtual corrections. If the
    deformation shifts those singularities, alongside everything else,
    the cancellation will be spoilt. However, in the scope of this
    thesis, we are only dealing with finite diagrams.

With these conditions in mind, we construct the deformation in the
following way:
As explained in Section 22 , we first organize the dual contributions
into groups. For every ellipsoid singularity of the group we include a
factor:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (216)
  -- -------- -- -------

with @xmath and @xmath the loop three-momentum. It is made up of two
main components:
The vector-part @xmath is designed to always point to the outside of the
singularity ellipsoid, see Fig. 20 . @xmath is a vector that points from
focus @xmath to a particular point in loop three-momentum space. This is
indicated by the dashed lines. Keep in mind that, despite its name, a
‘focus’ is not a focal point of the ellipse/ellipsoid, but rather refers
to the foci introduced in Section 15 , i.e. focus @xmath . Dividing by
@xmath rescales the vector to length 1. The same procedure is repeated
with @xmath . Adding the two together results in the angle between
@xmath and the resulting vector part always being @xmath . By choosing
all the scaling parameters @xmath for all possible combinations @xmath
we satisfy the first condition.

Inside the singularity ellipsoid the two vectors @xmath and @xmath
cancel totally along the major axis of the ellipsoid. This cancellation
in the vicinity of the center of the singularity ellipsoid is shown in
Fig. 21 . In order to be able to plot the situation, the graphs are
restricted to 1+2 dimensions. Keep in mind that the imaginary part of
the plotted deformation is a two component vector where each component
is a function of @xmath and @xmath . Therefore, the graphs 20(a) and
20(b) indicate how far the deformation goes in the direction of the
imaginary part of the @xmath - and @xmath -axis.

The suppression factor @xmath fulfills the second condition. At the
position of the singularity, @xmath is 0 and thus the suppression factor
reaches its maximum. Far away from the singularity, @xmath is a large
negative value and thus the exponential is close to zero. This behaviour
is demonstrated in Fig. 22 .

@xmath is a scaling factor analogous to @xmath in Section 23.1 . @xmath
is the width of the deformation. The indices @xmath in @xmath and @xmath
indicate that those parameters can be chosen individually for each
contribution to the deformation for optimization purposes. Then we sum
over the entire group and arrive at:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (217)
  -- -------- -- -------

where, of course, @xmath is the imaginary unit. Finally, we add the
imaginary contribution to the loop momentum to make the deformation
complete.

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (218)
  -- -------- -- -------

The corresponding Jacobian can be calculated analytically.

### 24 Choosing the parameters

As mentioned before, the parameters @xmath and @xmath are the scaling
and the width of the deformation. Typically, @xmath is a dimensionless
negative number and @xmath a positive number of dimension @xmath ;
setting all @xmath completely switches off the deformation.
Although they can all be chosen differently, selecting @xmath and @xmath
produces very good results for most of the examples that we are
presenting within this thesis. As a rule of thumb, @xmath where @xmath
is a measure for the @xmath of the process in consideration.

#### 24.1 The scaling parameter @xmath

The parameter @xmath determines how far an individual contribution to
the deformation goes around a pole. This is illustrated in Fig. 23 , in
which for the sake of clarity we restricted ourselves to @xmath
dimensions and a deformation that consists of only one contribution.

From the dotted to the dashed and finally to the solid line, @xmath has
been doubled every time while keeping the width constant. Therefore, the
peak of the solid curve is four times higher (lower) than the dotted
one. Between @xmath and @xmath there is a region where the deformation
vanishes. This is the cancelling effect of the vector part mentioned in
Section 23.2 . In 1+1 dimensions this leads to a total cancellation. It
is equivalent to slicing Fig. 21 along the axis that connects the two
foci of the singularity ellipse.
There is one further aspect to it which is inspired by [ 89 ] . On the
one hand, we would like to choose @xmath as large as possible to stay
away from the singularity. One the other hand, we would like to make
@xmath as small as possible in order to ensure that we do not enclose
other (unwanted) singularities. To escape from this dilemma, consider
the on shell energy @xmath with the deformation @xmath plugged in:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (219)
  -- -------- -- -------

Here we have introduced an overall factor @xmath . It scales the entire
deformation as opposed to the @xmath which scale individual
contributions to the deformation (see Eq. ( 217 )).
Since @xmath , this puts a constraint on @xmath . We set the square root
to zero and solve the quadratic equation in @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (220)
  -- -------- -- -------

with

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (221)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath . If @xmath , the poles of @xmath lie on the
imaginary @xmath -axis and the real value of @xmath may take any value.
If however, @xmath and @xmath we have a pole at @xmath . Thus we define
@xmath in the following way:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (222)
  -- -------- -- -------

After performing this check for every dual contribution in the
deformation group, we end up with a set of “safety @xmath s” out of
which we pick the smallest. Using this procedure, we make sure that our
deformation does not come too close to other singularities originating
from the dual delta function.

#### 24.2 The width of the deformation

The parameter @xmath determines how broad or narrow the peaks of the
deformation contributions are. This is illustrated in Fig. 24 . Again,
to improve clarity, the plot is restricted to @xmath dimensions and the
deformation used has only a single contribution to it.

This time the width has been increased by a factor of five from the
dotted to the dashed curve and another factor five from the dashed to
the solid curve. The scaling parameter @xmath has been kept constant.
As mentioned, setting @xmath works fine for the majority of momentum
configurations that we tested. Nonetheless, there are some cases where a
bigger (or smaller) choice of width is advised to get good precision. To
understand why, let us have a look at the dual propagator in its
rewritten form:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (223)
  -- -------- -- -------

We see that the inverse of the dual propagator is proportional to
momentum @xmath . In the suppression factor the inverse of the dual
propagator gets squared. Hence the exponent of the suppression factor is
@xmath . In order to avoid the deformation getting to wide or too
narrow, it is necessary choose the width proportional to the physical
energy scale of the external momenta.

### 25 Numerical Results

Now we are in possession of all the necessary tools to make the
numerical integration work. We have a code which runs on a desktop
machine with an Intel i7 (3.4GHz) processor with 8 cores and 16 GB of
RAM. Memory consumption is negligible.

#### 25.1 Details on the implementation

The program is written entirely in C++ and uses the Cuba library [ 71 ]
as a numerical integrator. This means it can be run on any machine on
which C++ and the Cuba library are available. As input the user has to
specify the number of external legs, the external momenta themselves,
the internal masses and, if necessary, the parameters of the contour
deformation. The momenta and masses can be read in from a text file.
With regard to the numerical integrator the user can choose between
Cuhre [ 95 , 96 ] and VEGAS and give the desired number of evaluations.
At this stage, the program is ready to be compiled and executed.
Schematically speaking, it performs the following steps:

1.  Read in momenta and masses.

2.  Check where ellipsoid singularities occur.

3.  Check where hyperboloid singularities occur and group the dual
    contributions accordingly.

4.  Call the integrator, taking into account the number of external legs
    as well as the results from the previous steps.

We use MATHEMATICA 8.0 [ 97 ] to generate randomized momenta and masses
and LoopTools 2.10 [ 98 ] to produce reference values for comparison.
The goal is to scan as much of the phase-space as possible to make sure
the program works properly in all regions. The momenta of all the
example points and scans of the following sections are collected in
Appendix \ttitle .
We see two main paths along which the complexity of the calculation
grows.

1.  Increasing the number of external legs. In general, going from
    @xmath legs means for the Duality:

    -   One extra dual contribution.

    -   Since each dual contribution does consist of one more dual
        propagator, there are much more possibilities for ellipsoid
        singularities to occur. Thus the deformation picks up more
        contributions.

    Therefore, we investigate multi-leg scalar integrals up to the
    pentagon level in this chapter.

2.  The presence of tensor numerators. Having tensors of increasing rank
    in the numerator will render the function to be integrated more
    complex. We address tensor integrals in Chapter \ttitle although it
    does not affect the singular behaviour of the integral.

Our setup is such that we run points asking for a fixed number of
evaluations. Then we modify the parameters of the deformation for best
results. ⁶ ⁶ 6 Part of the results which we are going to show in the
following will be published in a forthcoming paper [ 3 ] .

#### 25.2 Scalar Triangle

We consider first infrared finite triangle (three external legs) scalar
integrals. Momentum configurations that do not need deformation (i.e.
whose loop integral is purely real) are integrated in about @xmath
seconds with a precision of at least 4 digits. @xmath evaluations are
sufficient to achieve this result.

Point LABEL:point1 of Table 1 has all internal masses equal while Point
LABEL:point2 has three different internal masses. Momenta and masses
were chosen randomly between @xmath and @xmath . This even allows for
unphysical momentum configurations, but at this stage we want to test
stability and precision regardless of whether we are in the physical
region or not. For example, although Triangle LABEL:point2 represents a
situation that is not realized in nature, it is computed without any
problems. From the program’s point of view there is no difference; the
internal masses are mere parameters.
For momentum configurations that require deformation the function to
integrate is more complicated, hence we have to evaluate it more often.
With @xmath iterations, the calculation time increases to around @xmath
seconds. Four digits of precision are achievable by optimizing the
parameters of the deformation.

Similar to the non-deformation points before, Point LABEL:point3 of
Table 2 has all internal masses equal whereas in Point LABEL:point4 all
three of them have different values. Regardless of kinematics, the
Loop–Tree Duality is capable of producing accurate results in both
situations.

Fig. 25 gives an additional view on a triangle example phase-space
point: Each of the cubes in the first line represents one dual
contribution. Drawn are the ellipsoid (violet surfaces) and hyperboloid
(orange surfaces) singularities in loop-momentum space. The blue dots
are the positions of the foci of the on-shell hyperboloids, i.e. @xmath
. In the second line we have the singularity scheme. This means each
line of the singularity scheme corresponds to one box.
Another important check is the scan around threshold. This region is
usually numerically unstable. The Loop–Tree Duality excels here, because
the algorithm does not have to do extra work. In Fig. 26 all internal
masses are equal, i.e. @xmath , @xmath , and the center-of-mass energy
@xmath was kept constant while the mass @xmath was varied. As you can
see from the plots, there is no drop in precision around threshold.
Calculation time remains constant, as well.

#### 25.3 Scalar Boxes

We repeated the analysis for the box (four external legs) case. The main
difference is that now there are four dual contributions with three dual
propagators each.
To get good precision, we chose to evaluate boxes that need deformation
for @xmath times, while the number of evaluations for non-deformation
phase-space points was kept at @xmath evaluations, the same as in the
triangle case. This is reflected in the program runtimes. Deformation
points take 16 seconds, non-deformation points take about 0.25 seconds,
respectively.
While it is practically guaranteed to get the non-deformation points
with good precision, the quality of results depends on the proper choice
of parameters for points with deformation. Therefore, we focus our
attention towards such points by giving many more examples for them.
A very good method to do so is to perform a mass-scan as we already did
in the triangle case. From Fig. 28 to Fig. 30 we present scans for the
following momentum configurations:

-   All internal masses equal. The center-of-mass energy @xmath is kept
    constant while the mass is varied. This is shown in Fig. 28 .

-   Two adjacent internal masses equal and the two opposing masses
    equal, i.e. @xmath and @xmath . @xmath and therefore also @xmath is
    varied, the other momenta and masses are kept constant. This is
    shown in Fig. 29 .

-   Scan in which the Mandelstam variable @xmath is varied. This is
    realized by varying @xmath while keeping @xmath constant. Of course,
    due to momentum conservation, this involves @xmath not being
    constant. This is shown in Fig. 30 .

Concrete values for each of those situations are found in Table 3 .
The scans show how the program performs in certain slices of the phase
space. This is important because we want the program to be generically
applicable to any momentum configuration. From the plots and tables, you
can see that the program deals well with all kinds of boxes, even when
many different kinematical scales are involved.
Point LABEL:point5 and LABEL:point7 of Table 3 correspond to a momentum
configuration, in which all four internal masses are equal. In Point
LABEL:point6 and LABEL:point8 all masses are different. In Point
LABEL:point9 two adjacent internal lines have equal masses as well as
the two opposing ones. Point LABEL:point10 represents a situation in
which opposite lines have equal masses.

Similar to the triangle case, Fig. 27 shows the singularities in loop
three-momentum space. It becomes immediatly obvious that, only by going
to box graphs, the level of complexity has grown substantially. Because
the hyperboloid singularities couple dual contributions together, an
individual contribution receives a much more complicated deformation.

In Fig. 27 , the dots give the locations of the foci @xmath , the
surfaces are ellipsoid and hyperboloid singularities. Note how the
hyperboloids always appear pairwisely across the dual contributions.

In Fig. 28 , two thresholds are passed at @xmath and @xmath . From right
to left, the number of ellipsoid singularities grows by one after each
threshold from one to three.

In Fig. 29 , one threshold is crossed at @xmath . From right to left the
number of ellipsoid singularities goes from one to two.

In Fig. 30 , the Mandelstam variable @xmath is being varied. Two
thresholds are passed, one at @xmath and one at @xmath . From left to
right, the number of ellipsoid singularities increases by one after each
crossing of a threshold from zero to two.

#### 25.4 Scalar Pentagons

After the evaluation of triangles and boxes, the next step is to check
pentagon (five external legs) graphs. Complexity grows once more, which
means:

-   A dual integral now consists of five dual contributions.

-   Each dual contribution contains one additional ( @xmath four in
    total) dual propagator.

Therefore, we had to increase the number of evaluations: Non-deformation
points are evaluated @xmath times which takes approximately @xmath
seconds. Points with deformation demand @xmath evaluations to maintain
the level of precision of the triangles and boxes. This results in an
average calculation time of 28 seconds. This enhanced complexity is
especially well-illustrated by the following Figure in which the
singularities of the different dual contributions are plotted in
loop-momentum space:

Again, dots are foci of the on-shell hyperboloids, surfaces are
ellipsoid and hyperboloid singularities. From the singularity scheme we
can read off that all five dual contributions are coupled together due
to the interaction of the hyperboloids.

Table 4 displays a collection of pentagon sample results for different
kinematical configurations. In Points LABEL:point11 and LABEL:point13
all internal masses are equal; in Point LABEL:point14 they are all
distinct from each other and in Point LABEL:point15 we have @xmath .
Again, the Loop-Tree Duality shows its robustness by producing accurate
results regardless of the kinematical situation. This statement is
further supported by various scans we performed:

-   All internal masses equal. The center-of-mass energy @xmath is kept
    constant while the mass gets varied. This is shown in Fig. 32 .

-   All five internal masses different. Mass @xmath gets varied, the
    rest is kept constant. This is shown in Fig. 33 .

-   Scan in which the center-of-mass energy @xmath is varied. This is
    realized by varying @xmath . Of course, due to momentum
    conservation, this involves @xmath not being constant. This is shown
    in Fig. 34 .

From the plots, you can see that the Loop-Tree Duality is able to
achieve good precision for pentagons as well. Even situations in which
many ellipsoid singularities are involved, are handled well by the
program. For example, the number of ellipsoid singularities in Figure 32
increases from two to five when going from right to left.

Three thresholds are passed in this scan. From right to left, we start
at two ellipsoid singularities and arrive at five.

One threshold is crossed at @xmath 0.2. From right to left, the number
of ellipsoid singularities increases from five to six.

In this scan, we pass three thresholds at @xmath and @xmath which divide
the graph into four zones. From right to left, we start with zero
ellipsoid singularities in the first zone, then we have one in the
second zone, two in the third zone and finally one in the last zone.

## Chapter \thechapter Tensor Integrals

Up to this point, we have shown that the Loop–Tree Duality is capable of
dealing with all kinds of kinematical configurations. The only
constraint that we have made was to limit ourselves to scalar integrals.
In Chapter \ttitle , we argued that the inclusion of numerators
different from 1 should not be an issue for the Loop–Tree Duality
because it acts only on the denominator of the loop integral. Hence, in
this chapter, we are going to relieve this restriction and repeat some
of the analysis of the previous chapter with tensor integrals.
Additionally, we are going one step further by calculating even
hexagons, which are usually tough to compute, but from the perspective
of LTD are a straightforward generalization.

### 26 The influence of numerators

To start off, we restate the Duality Theorem for scalar integrals (cf.
Eq. ( 174 )):

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (224)
  -- -------- -- -------

where

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (225)
  -- -------- -- -------

If our one-loop integral features a non-trivial numerator @xmath . Then,
the Loop–Tree Duality Theorem takes the form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (226)
  -- -------- -- -------

While the numerator is formally left unchanged, there actually is a
practical impact. The presence of the dual delta function demands @xmath
which is equivalent to having the energy component of the loop-momentum
forced to

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (227)
  -- -------- -- -------

In other words, whenever we perform a single cut of a Feynman graph, the
numerator has to be evaluated at the position of the cut which is fixed
by the dual delta function. As a direct consequence, the numerator takes
a different form in each dual contribution.

Another important aspect to take into consideration is the cancellation
of singularities among dual contributions. In Section 16 , we argued
that numerators do not spoil the cancellation of the hyperboloid
singularities. Here, we would like to make explicitly show why. A
typical numerator is a product of scalar products of the form
“loop-momentum contracted with external momentum”: @xmath . Let us see
what happens to a single factor when it hits the singularity. Note
first, that the hyperboloid singularity is given by Eq. ( 179 ) which we
rewrite in the more suitable form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (228)
  -- -------- -- -------

Using Eq. ( 227 ), the loop-momentum @xmath contracted with some
external momentum @xmath is:

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
              @xmath      (229)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

where we have used Eq. ( 228 ) for the first equality on the second line
of Eq. ( 229 ). It means that the numerators of two dual contributions
@xmath and @xmath take the same value at their common pole, thus leaving
the cancellation of hyperboloid singularities intact. This is an
important property to take advantage of, because it allows us to
straightforwardly apply the Loop–Tree-Duality to such diagrams without
any additional effort.

#### 26.1 An illustrative example

To make things even more explicit, consider the following simple
example. We take the triangle integral of Section 9.2 and give it the
numerator @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (230)
  -- -------- -- -------

@xmath and @xmath are the external momenta. Since we are dealing with a
triangle, obviously @xmath . Consequently, the Loop–Tree Duality
translates the Feynman integral into three dual contributions.

  -- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath      (231)
  -- -------- -------- -- -------

This time, we investigate how the numerator affects the calculus. The
dual delta functions of the different contributions fix the energy
component of the numerators to different values. Hence the scalar
product becomes

  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath         
     @xmath   @xmath         
     @xmath   @xmath         (232)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------

This means, that finally we will arrive at with three dual contributions
similar to the ones of Eq. ( 112 ).

In the next sections, we present the results for multi-leg tensor
integrals. We only consider IR- and UV-finite diagrams. The explicit
momenta of all the points and scans presented within this chapter are
found in Appendix \ttitle .

### 27 Tensor Triangles

In Chapter \ttitle , we convinced ourselves that the Loop–Tree Duality
can produce accurate results for scalar one–loop integrals independent
of the kinematical configuration. Now, we focus on checking various
different numerator functions within a similar analysis.
We start with infrared-finite one–loop triangle graphs. The simplest
non-trivial numerator function possible is the loop-momentum @xmath
contracted with one of the external momenta @xmath or @xmath , i.e.
@xmath or @xmath . Since we are limiting our discussion to UV-finite
graphs, these are the only possible numerators at the triangle level.
The number of evaluations per phase-space point is the same as in the
scalar case; this means @xmath evaluations for non-deformation points
and @xmath evaluations for phase-space points with deformation. Due to
the presence of numerators, the integrand function is a bit more
complex. Hence the calculation time, compared to scalar triangles
increases from 2.5 seconds to 3.5 seconds for deformation-points. For
non-deformation points there is hardly any measurable difference, i.e.
they stay at around 0.15 seconds
A compilation examples is shown in Table 5 . Points LABEL:point16 and
LABEL:point18 correspond to kinematical situations in which all internal
masses are equal and the numerator is @xmath , whereas Points
LABEL:point17 and LABEL:point19 have all internal masses are different
from each other and numerator @xmath .

In the triangle mass-scan of Fig. 35 , we varied the mass in the same
way as we did in the previous chapter. Three thresholds are passed at
@xmath , 0.45 and 1.

### 28 Tensor Boxes

Again, we repeat the analysis of the triangles at the box-level. We only
want to deal with UV-finite diagrams, thus tensors up to rank three are
allowed in the numerator. Since having a rank-one tensor is quite
similar to the triangle case, we will focus on rank two and rank three
situations in order to have a more challenging test for the program.
We use the same number of evaluations as we did for scalars, this means
@xmath evaluations for deformation points and @xmath evaluations for
points that do not need deformation. As far as deformation points are
concerned, calculation times differ according to the rank of the tensor
function in the numerator. Their general order of magnitude is around 20
seconds, the span between a rank zero and a rank three tensor amounts to
8 seconds. Non-deformation points take about 0.25 seconds, almost
independently of the rank of the numerator function.

In Table 6 , Points LABEL:point20 and LABEL:point22 are boxes with all
internal masses equal and numerator @xmath . Points LABEL:point21 and
LABEL:point23 represent situations in which all internal masses are
different and the numerator has the form @xmath .

We also did a scan of the Mandelstam variable @xmath , see Fig. 36 , for
which we took a box with three scalar products in the numerator, @xmath
, and varied @xmath while keeping @xmath constant. Since @xmath also
appears in the numerator, both numerator and denominator are affected by
this scan.

### 29 Tensor Pentagons

Next, we investigate pentagon tensor integrals at the one–loop level
with numerators up to rank three. The number of evaluations is chosen to
be the same as in the scalar case, i.e. @xmath times for non-deformation
and @xmath times for phase-space points that require deformation. This
results in calculation times of 0.7 seconds and 33 seconds,
respectively. The runtime difference between a point with a numerator of
rank zero and rank three is negligible for non-deformation points and
about 10 seconds for deformation points.
Table 7 shows a selection of sample points. Point LABEL:point24 and
LABEL:point26 feature the rank two numerator @xmath while Point
LABEL:point25 and LABEL:point27 have the numerator @xmath . In all
points all internal masses are equal. At first glance, Point
LABEL:point27 seems to be weaker but it actually contains six ellipsoid
singularities whereas the other points usually have two to three. We
include this point to demonstrate that the program holds well together
even under such challenging circumstances.

We also performed several scans; a sample is presented in Figure 37 . In
that scan, similarly to what we have done with scalar pentagons, we
varied @xmath and thus the center-of-mass energy @xmath . The
corresponding numerator function is @xmath , which means that both
numerator and denominator take part in the scan. From the plot, we can
see that the Loop-Tree Duality is able to pass this challenging test.

### 30 Tensor Hexagons

We also analysed hexagon (six external legs) tensor integrals, for which
we raised the number of evaluations for non-deformation points to @xmath
and for deformation points to @xmath . The corresponding calculation
times are 8 and 75 seconds, respectively. Since we evaluate
non-deformation points ten times more compared to pentagons, the
different numerators have a measurable impact on the calculation time.
The difference between rank zero and rank three is 6 seconds and 15
seconds for deformation points.
LoopTools can provide reference values only up to pentagons. Instead, we
used the program SecDec version 3 [ 38 ] for comparison.
Again, we present a selection of sample points in Table 8 . Point
LABEL:point28 and LABEL:point30 feature the rank-one numerator @xmath ,
in the former all internal masses are different and in the latter they
are all equal. Point LABEL:point29 has six distinct internal masses and
the numerator function @xmath , Point LABEL:point31 possesses the
numerator @xmath and six different masses, as well. Finally, in Point
LABEL:point32 , which exhibits the numerator @xmath , all momenta are
distinct form each other.

## Chapter \thechapter Summary and Future Work

### 31 Summary

One of the main difficulties in calculating scattering amplitudes at NLO
and higher is the cancellation of infrared singularities among real and
virtual corrections. The Loop–Tree Duality aims to solve that problem by
recasting the virtual corrections in a form which closely resembles the
real ones. This appealing property motivates the idea of combining the
two, thus treating them simultaneously in a common Monte Carlo event
generator.
Initially the LTD was introduced for scalar one–loop integrals [ 48 ]
and in later works its applicability has been expanded by a large margin
via a systematic procedure has been established to calculate Feynman
graphs with an arbitrary number of loops [ 49 ] . In Chapter \ttitle and
in [ 1 ] we have shown how to deal with loop integrals involving higher
order poles. Instead of applying the Residue Theorem for higher order
poles, using Integration By Parts techniques reduced the integrals
featuring such poles to integrals with simple poles. After that we could
go ahead and straightforwardly apply the known formulae. At that point,
the major theoretical questions were answered and the important was to
check the efficiency of the method. To that direction, as a preparatory
step (Chapter \ttitle and [ 2 ] ), we investigated the singularities of
the dual contributions and found a partial cancellation of singularities
among contributions happening at the integrand level . In the case of
massless diagrams, we were able to show that the infrared singularities
are confined to a finite region of loop-momentum space which can then be
mapped to the real corrections. With this information at hand, we did a
numerical implementation of the Loop–Tree Duality in the form of a
computer program written in C++. Being a first step towards the combined
treatment, the program calculated one-loop integrals. Due to the partial
cancellation of singularities, we only had to deal with singularities of
the ellipsoid type. We dealt with the ellipsoid singularities by contour
deformation. Still, the hyperboloid singularities affected the way we
deformed: In order to keep the cancellations intact, we grouped dual
contributions featuring the same hyperboloid singularities together.
Then, we employed a contour deformation that accounted for all the
ellipsoid singularities of the entire group. This contour deformation
was constructed to respect the @xmath -prescription of the propagators
and fall rapidly to 0 where it was not needed so that the value of the
overall integral would not be altered. Since dual integrals are
three–dimensional, we only had to deform in loop three-momentum space.
As integrators we used Cuhre and VEGAS from the Cuba library. This setup
has proven to be successful. We were able to calculate (UV- and
IR-finite) scalar with good precision. This has been illustrated by
showing individual points as well as several scans through the phase
space, in which we picked one mass or momentum to be varied while the
other ones were kept constant. In Chapter \ttitle we also demonstrated
that the Loop-Tree Duality deals equally well with tensor integrals
(numerators different from 1) up to rank three.
The numerical implementation is still in an early state. Neverthelss,
the wide range of checks we have performed proves the potential of the
method. In particular, the implementation works well independently from
the number of kinematical scales (bilinears, trilinears, different
masses) involved or whether a phase space point is in the vicinity of a
threshold or not.

### 32 Future Work

Having shown that the Loop–Tree Duality method works and is efficient,
the next step will be to address any issue the code might run into.
Furthermore we would like to provide a systematical way to choose the
parameters @xmath and the width for optimal results. We also aim to try
the LTD for a real, physical process (i.e. not a toy model), for example
the six- or eight-photon amplitude. To that end, we will move towards
treating a case where we combine the real and virtual corrections. The
goal is to have a highly automated program which calculates the entire
cross-section at the one-loop level. Finally, the next step in our list
is to implement the LTD for two-loop amplitudes. This is quite an
extensive list, but with the presented work we have laid a good basis.

## Chapter \thechapter Duality Nomenclature

-    Loop–Tree Duality :
    The Loop–Tree Duality (in short: Duality) is a Feynman integral
    transformation that maps loop integrals to a sum of phase-space
    (tree–level) integrals. Within the conventions of Chapter \ttitle ,
    the Loop–Tree Duality at one-loop level looks like:

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (233)
      -- -------- -- -------

    This transformation is achieved by performing the integration over
    the energy component of the loop integral. The resulting integration
    runs only over the loop three-momentum and is very similar to the
    real radiation corrections. Thus, it encourages the idea of
    combining the two, treating them simultaneously in a common Monte
    Carlo event generator.
    Each summand is called dual contribution and is constructed
    according to a special pattern: One of the internal lines gets
    on-shell, i.e. it is replaced by a dual delta function , while all
    the other (non-cut) Feynman propagators are promoted to dual
    propagators . This procedure is repeated for every internal line
    once and the results are added together to yield the dual integral .

-    Dual delta function :
    The dual delta function @xmath is the delta function that appears
    after applying the Loop–Tree Duality:

      -- -------- --
         @xmath   
      -- -------- --

    It serves several purposes. Formally it is there (cf. Eq. ( 233 ))
    to indicate that the energy integration has already been carried
    out, leaving an integral over the loop three-momentum only. It fixes
    the @xmath -component to a certain value determined by the argument
    of the delta function. The theta function, which is included in the
    dual delta function, ensures that the positive energy solution gets
    picked from the argument of the dual delta function.

-    Dual propagator :
    Applying the Loop–Tree Duality involves converting all Feynman
    propagators to dual propagators, except the cut one. There are two
    representations of the dual propagator,

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (234)
      -- -------- -- -------

    where

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (235)
      -- -------- -- -------

    The main difference between a dual propagator and a Feynman
    propagator is the @xmath -prescription. The Feynman propagator
    depends on the loop four-momentum as opposed to the dual propagator
    which depends on the loop three-momentum.
    The @xmath -prescription indicates which way to go around the
    singularities when integrating. Since the integration of the energy
    component has already been carried out, the dual propagator can only
    depend on the loop three-momentum and the @xmath -prescription gets
    modified (for details on how and why this happens, see Section 7 ).
    As a direct consequence, the new dual prescription is merely a way
    of bookkeeping on how to go around singularities in loop
    three-momentum space.
    The form on the left of Eq. ( 234 ) is a natural result of the
    derivation of the Loop–Tree Duality, the form on the right is a
    little more suited for numerical implementations.

-    Dual prescription :
    The modified @xmath -prescription of the dual propagator is called
    dual prescription. The dual prescription of the dual propagator
    @xmath has the form

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (236)
      -- -------- -- -------

    where @xmath is a future-like four-vector, @xmath . Typically,
    @xmath is chosen to be @xmath . In general, @xmath depends on the
    choice of the coordinate frame. Nonetheless, once all dual
    contributions have been added together, @xmath cancels out. In other
    words dual integrals are independent from the choice of @xmath
    whereas individual dual contributions do depend on it. At one–loop,
    the vector @xmath does not depend on the loop momentum and
    determines the sign of the dual prescription.

-    Dual contribution :
    A dual contribution is one individual summand of the sum in Eq. (
    233 ),

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (237)
      -- -------- -- -------

    It represents one single cut of a one-loop diagram. The cut line
    gets replaced by a dual delta function, the Feynman propagators of
    all other internal lines are promoted to dual propagators. This is
    demonstrated explicitly in Section 9.2 .
    Loop–Tree Duality converts a one-loop integral with @xmath external
    legs into a sum of @xmath dual contributions. While the original
    one-loop integral runs over the loop four-momentum, the integrations
    of the dual contributions are only three-dimensional thus
    simplifying the calculation.
    Individual dual contributions can feature singularities (hyperboloid
    singularities, cf. Section 21 ) that partially disappear once all
    dual contributions are combined.

-    Dual integral :
    The dual integral is the end result obtained by applying the
    Loop–Tree Duality to a one-loop integral:

      -- -------- -- -------
         @xmath      (238)
      -- -------- -- -------

    It features a couple of appealing properties: Since the @xmath
    -integration has already been performed, the resulting dual integral
    only involves a three-dimensional integration. In fact, it resembles
    the form of the real corrections. Therefore, the Loop–Tree Duality
    aims towards a combined treatment of loop and tree contributions.

## Chapter \thechapter Proof of the Reduction of Eq. (148)

Here we solve the system of equations, explicitly, to arrive at Eq. (
148 ). We note that we are not aiming for a full reduction to a set of
master integrals but rather to reduce the multiple poles to single
poles. Therefore, any integral which has single propagators is to be
considered known.

Using the IBPs, Eq. ( 147 ), on the generic integral @xmath , we get the
system of equations:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (239)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (240)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (241)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (242)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (243)
  -- -------- -- -------

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (244)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath . The appearance of the operator @xmath signals that we
have the ISP @xmath in the numerator of an integral. As long as these
integrals possess single propagators, we will not reduce them further
but consider them known. We also note that a lot of the integrals that
appear after setting particular values to the parameters @xmath in this
system, are zero in dimensional regularization (in the massless case).
Let us start by setting @xmath in ( 240 ). We get:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (245)
  -- -------- -- -------

Taking the sum of ( 243 ) and ( 244 ) and setting @xmath we get:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (246)
  -- -------- -- -------

Taking the difference between ( 243 ) and ( 244 ) and setting @xmath we
get:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (247)
  -- -------- -- -------

Finally, setting @xmath in ( 239 ), we get:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (248)
  -- -------- -- -------

The integrals @xmath and @xmath and @xmath , in this system of
equations, can be computed simply by taking further, appropriate
combinations of Eqs. ( 239 )-( 244 ). Setting @xmath in ( 239 ) we get
@xmath . It also holds that @xmath , as can be seen by making the shifts
in the loop momenta @xmath . From Eq. ( 243 ), by setting @xmath and
using the value of @xmath , we get: @xmath . Finally, adding Eqs. ( 239
) and ( 240 ) and setting @xmath we get: @xmath . The rest of the system
of equations ( 245 )-( 248 ) can now be solved sequencially, arriving
at:

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (249)
  -- -------- -- -------

a result which, after putting @xmath , agrees with Eq. ( 148 ).

## Chapter \thechapter Momenta of the Example Points

Here we give the momenta and masses of the different phase-space points
and scans shown in Chapter \ttitle and \ttitle . Due to momentum
conservation @xmath , therefore it is sufficient to give only the
momenta @xmath to @xmath .
