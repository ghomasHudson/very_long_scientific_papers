The present Thesis is dedicated to a formal and phenomenological
investigation of extensions to two separate sectors of the Standard
Model of particle physics (SM): the electroweak sector and the strong
sector. The Thesis is divided into two main parts: Part I focuses on the
Lee-Wick Standard Model (LW SM), which, by providing a solution to the
Hierarchy problem, forms a natural extension of the electroweak sector,
while Part II studies the coloron theory , arising from extending the
strong sector gauge group.

Providing a general introduction about the current state of the SM and
the associated challenges in Chapter 1, we proceed in Chapter 2 to
analyze the tension between naturalness and isospin violation in the
LW SM. Chapter 3 discusses the global symmetries and the
renormalizability of LW scalar QED. A first complete calculation of QCD
corrections to the production of a massive color-octet vector boson
(colorons) is reported in Chapter 4. Finally, we conclude the Thesis in
Chapter 5 by summarizing the discussed results and presenting an outlook
for future research in the surveyed areas.
