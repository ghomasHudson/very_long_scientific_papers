This thesis details a class of partial orders on the space of probability
distributions and the space of density operators which capture the idea of
information content. Some links to domain theory and computational linguistics
are also discussed. Chapter 1 details some useful theorems from order theory.
In Chapter 2 we define a notion of an information ordering on the space of
probability distributions and see that this gives rise to a large class of
orderings. In Chapter 3 we extend the idea of an information ordering to the
space of density operators and in particular look at the maximum eigenvalue
order. We will discuss whether this order might be unique given certain
restrictions. In Chapter 4 we discuss a possible application in distributional
language models, namely in the study of entailment and disambiguation.
