This thesis discusses two different approaches for the measurement of
cosmic-ray antiparticles in the GeV to TeV energy range.
  The first part of this thesis discusses the prospects of antiparticle flux
measurements with the proposed PEBS detector. The project allots long duration
balloon flights at one of Earth's poles at an altitude of 40 km. GEANT4
simulations were carried out which determine the atmospheric background and
attenuation especially for antiparticles.
  The second part covers the AMS-02 experiment which will be installed in 2010
on the International Space Station at an altitude of about 400 km for about
three years to measure cosmic rays without the influence of Earth's atmosphere.
The present work focuses on the anticoincidence counter system (ACC). The ACC
is needed to reduce the trigger rate during periods of high fluxes and to
reject external particles crossing the tracker from the side or particles
resulting from interactions within the detector which would otherwise disturb
the clean charge and momentum measurements. The last point is especially
important for the measurement of antinuclei and antiparticles.
