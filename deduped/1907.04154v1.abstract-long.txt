The Geofencing system is the key to operate the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) within the safe and appropriate zone to avoid public concerns and
other privacy issues. The system is designed to keep the UAV away from
geofenced obstacles using the onboard GNSS and IMU location. The
Geofencing system is part of the H2020 GAUSS project and facilities
other subsystems, for instance, to support the command and control link,
which is the security measure to secure the UAV from hijacking and
signal spoofing.

The regulatory authorities expressed the concern of having UAVs flying
in the no-fly zone and causing troubles from offending private privacy
to hazards at airport airspace. Hence the geofence system shall provide
guidance message, which enables the UAV to evacuate from no-fly-zone,
based on real-time updated location.

This thesis aims to first illustrate the generation of geofence and then
apply the geofence system on UAV operation. This application enables UAV
to fly in the designated area without human intervention. The project is
built with JAVA using GIS-enabled Database Management System and Open
Soured Map data powered by OpenStreetMap and OS map. This method has
been tested by simulations which had results of high accuracy.
