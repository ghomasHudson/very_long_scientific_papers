## 1 Introduction

Lattice QCD has played an important role in elementary particle physics,
in particular, in studying the low energy dynamics of hadrons. One can
nonperturbatively calculate hadron masses or decay constants with Monte
Carlo simulations. As compensation, however, the lattice discretization
of space-time spoils a lot of symmetries of the gauge theory. Violation
of the translational symmetry would be an easiest example.

It is well known that chiral symmetry is not compatible with the absence
of fermion doubling, due to the periodic properties of the lattice Dirac
operator in momentum space [ 1 , 2 ] . A popular prescription to avoid
the appearance of unphysical modes, or doublers, is adding a so-called
Wilson term [ 3 ] to the naive subtraction operator;

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.1)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is Wilson parameter (we set @xmath .). ² ² 2 The other
notations used here and in the following of this paper are summarized in
appendix A . This term gives a large mass to the doublers which are
decoupled from the theory. The Wilson term, however, violates chiral
symmetry. A well known difficulty with Wilson fermion is
renormalization. The complicated operator mixing, additive quark mass
corrections, have to be calculated. Actually these are obstacles to
obtain reliable numerical data, especially in the chiral limit.

With the overlap Dirac operator [ 4 , 5 ] , as well as the other Dirac
operators [ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] , which satisfies the Ginsparg-Wilson
relation [ 11 ] , one can construct lattice gauge theories which have
the exact chiral symmetry [ 12 ] . Although the good chiral behaviors in
applying the overlap operator to QCD are reported in both theoretical
and numerical studies, its locality properties and smoothness with
respect to the gauge fields are not so obvious. Since it has a term
proportional to @xmath , where @xmath is a fixed parameter in the region
@xmath , the near zero modes of @xmath can contaminate the locality or
smoothness properties. In fact, it is not difficult to see that there
exist some points where the overlap Dirac operator, @xmath , is not
smooth by noting the fact that the index of @xmath can take integer
values only. Also practically, near zero modes of @xmath causes some
problems in the numerical simulations. Small eigen-modes of @xmath lower
the convergence of polynomial or rational expansion of @xmath . For
example, to keep a certain accuracy, the order of the Chebyshev
polynomial has to be proportional to @xmath , where @xmath is the
minimum eigenvalue of @xmath . In full QCD with the dynamical overlap
fermion [ 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ] ,
one would have to carefully perform the hybrid Monte Carlo [ 25 ]
updating near @xmath points since sudden changes of the trajectories,
reflection or refraction, should occur due to sudden jumps of the
fermion determinant. Thus, at least, the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath
always needs to be monitored in conventional methods of lattice QCD
simulations, which is very time consuming and it is known that
reflection/refraction itself has systematic errors when one employs the
pseudo-fermion method [ 23 ] . Because of these difficulties, no lattice
QCD study with the @xmath overlap Dirac fermions has been done except
for the cases with a very small lattice size.

An interesting solution might be prohibiting the topology change along
the simulations. It is known that under a smoothness condition on the
plaquette variables [ 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 ] ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (1.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is called the “admissibility” bound, any eigenvalues of @xmath are
non-zero (we denote @xmath ) and the topological charge can be conserved
if @xmath , which is a fixed number, is sufficiently small [ 29 , 30 ] .
Furthermore, when @xmath , the locality is also guaranteed. The
“admissibility” condition, Eq.( 1.2 ), is automatically satisfied if one
takes a type of gauge action which diverges when @xmath [ 31 , 32 , 33 ,
34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 ] .

Topology transitions can also be suppressed by including the factor,
@xmath , in the functional integral [ 39 ] . The inclusion of this
factor was previously considered in a study of domain-wall fermions [ 40
, 41 , 42 ] , where the aim was to reduce the effects of the finiteness
of the lattice in the 5th dimension. If any eigenvalue approaches near
@xmath along the simulation, the determinant, @xmath , would give a very
small Boltzmann weight, and such a trajectory would be rejected. Since
@xmath is equivalent to @xmath Wilson fermion determinant with a
negative cutoff-scale mass, it would not have any effects on the low
energy physics. Moreover, the numerical cost of this determinant is
expected to be much smaller than that of the dynamical overlap fermions.

What can we do with the configurations in a fixed topological sector ? A
straightforward application would be QCD in the so-called @xmath -regime
[ 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ] , where the linear extent of the
space-time is smaller than the pion Compton wave length @xmath . In this
regime (though it is an unphysical small-volume situation), it is
believed that one would be able to evaluate the pion decay constant and
the chiral condensates, which are the fundamental parameters of the
chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) [ 49 , 50 ] . They should be evaluated
in lattice QCD studies without taking the large volume limit, since the
finite volume effects are already involved on the ChPT side [ 51 , 52 ,
53 , 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 64 , 65 , 66 ] .

In this thesis, we study

1.  The practical feasibility of the topology conserving gauge action
    which keeps the “admissibility” bound, Eq.( 1.2 ), as well as the
    Wilson fermion action with a large negative mass. A careful analysis
    on the gluonic quantity and comparison with that with the standard
    plaquette action have to be done.

2.  How much stable the topological charge can be, with these topology
    conserving actions.

3.  Their effect on the numerical cost of the overlap Dirac operator.

4.  The determination of the low energy constants of quenched chiral
    perturbation theory in the @xmath -regime in a fixed topological
    sector. This study would be helpful when @xmath simulations with the
    dynamical overlap fermion are done in the future works.

We start with the theoretical details on the overlap Dirac operator and
topology of the lattice gauge fields in Sec. 2 . The technical issues of
our numerical study is presented in Sec. 3 . To test their practical
application, the static quark potential with different couplings and
@xmath and with/without the negative mass Wilson fermions is
investigated (Sec. 4 ). We study the parameter dependence of the
topological charge stability in Sec. 5 . Then the effects on the overlap
Dirac operator are discussed in Sec. 6 . The numerical result of
quenched lattice QCD in the @xmath -regime is presented in Sec. 7 .
Conclusions and discussions are given in Sec. 8 .

## 2 The overlap Dirac operator and topology

The overlap Dirac operator [ 4 , 5 ] is defined by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

which satisfies the Ginsparg-Wilson relation [ 11 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

and @xmath -hermiticity @xmath . Here @xmath is a real parameter which
satisfies @xmath . The Dirac operator Eq.( 2.1 ) is gauge covariant and
has no fermion doubling, as one can see in the Fourier transform of
@xmath in the free case ³ ³ 3 Here we show @xmath case for simplicity. ;

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.3)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where the term @xmath at @xmath in any direction @xmath gives large
mass, so that the doublers are decoupled and the continuum limit can be
properly taken [ 12 ] . The Ginsparg-Wilson relation guarantees that the
fermion action

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

is exactly invariant under the chiral rotation, even for finite lattice
spacings;

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

Thus the chiral symmetry at classical level is realized on the lattice.

In order to see quantum level properties of chiral symmetry, let us
consider the eigenstates of the operator @xmath [ 67 , 68 ] . Note that
if an eigen-mode of @xmath has the eigenvalue @xmath , it is also the
eigenstate of @xmath with the eigenvalue @xmath , which means that this
mode has @xmath chirality. It is easier to see that zero modes of @xmath
can be taken as eigen-modes of @xmath . Every other mode of @xmath with
eigenvalue @xmath in the range @xmath is not chiral but has its pair
with eigenvalue @xmath through the Ginsparg-Wilson relation;

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.6)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

These modes have another interesting property,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (2.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

which is again obtained from the Ginsparg-Wilson relation;

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.8)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Now it is obvious to see

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.9)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

and

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.10)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where @xmath denotes the number of @xmath modes and @xmath is that of
the zero modes with @xmath chirality. It is known that the equation

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.11)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

can be obtained with the perturbative expansion @xmath . Eq.( 2.9 ) and
Eq.( 2.11 ) show that the Atiyah-Singer index theorem is restored in the
continuum limit. In this way, the overlap Dirac operator properly
establishes the quantum aspects of chiral symmetry, the anomaly or the
index theorem, on the lattice.

It is, however, not difficult to see that the overlap Dirac operator is
not a smooth function of link variables. Consider two gauge
configurations, one of which @xmath gives the index @xmath and another
is @xmath with @xmath , where @xmath denotes Lie algebra of @xmath . One
obtains a smooth path which connects @xmath and @xmath , for example,
@xmath , while @xmath can take integers only. There must be at least one
jump from @xmath to @xmath , at some @xmath along the path, @xmath .
This jump of @xmath indicates non-smoothness of the overlap Dirac
operator. Hernández et al. [ 29 ] showed that this discontinuity occurs
exactly when @xmath has zero mode. They also proved that if the
configuration space is limited such that @xmath holds for a certain
positive number @xmath , then the locality is also guaranteed ⁴ ⁴ 4
Recently it is discussed that the mobility edge of @xmath plays a more
important role for the locality property. See refs. [ 69 , 70 , 71 , 72
, 73 ] . . To see what happens when an eigenvalue crosses @xmath , let
us rewrite the overlap Dirac operator,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since every complex eigenvalue @xmath of @xmath makes a pair with its
complex conjugate @xmath , only real modes can pass through @xmath or
@xmath . Note that any real modes are chiral; @xmath , and these real
modes are the eigenstates of @xmath which eigenvalues take 0 or @xmath
only, which means that crossing @xmath is always accompanied by topology
changes.

In the numerical studies, there is a very crucial advantage of
suppressing the small eigenvalues of @xmath . In order to implement the
overlap Dirac operator, the sign function in Eq.( 2.1 ) has to be
expressed in the polynomial or rational expansion;

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.13)
                                         
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

whose errors are controlled to some desired accuracy. The order of
polynomial or rational function one needs is known to be a monotonous
increasing function of the condition number @xmath :

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath and @xmath denote the lowest and the highest eigenvalues
respectively. For example, the accuracy of the Chebyshev polynomial
approximation of sign function, @xmath , with degree @xmath is
empirically known as @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath are constants [ 53
] . Apparently the approximation of finite order @xmath would break down
when @xmath . In the hybrid Monte Carlo simulation with the dynamical
overlap fermion (See appendix B .) [ 25 ] , the problem would be worse,
since one has to consider the discontinuity of the fermion determinant [
16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ] . Every molecular dynamics step in
the simulation trajectory, one would have to monitor the nearest
zero-mode of @xmath , and judge if the topology change occurs or not.
Then careful recalculation of the link updates has to be done to
determine the simulation trajectory to enter the other topological
sector (refraction) or go back to the previous sector (reflection). This
procedure would require an enormous numerical cost when one tries the
Monte Carlo simulation in a large volume. If one omits this step it
would make the acceptance rate very low due to overlooking sudden jumps
of the determinant. Keeping topology and assuring smoothness of the
determinant allows us to avoid this procedure. Thus, to exclude
configurations which gives @xmath is useful not only theoretically to
construct a sound quantum lattice theory with a smooth fermion
determinant (in particular, it is essential for the chiral gauge theory
[ 26 , 27 , 28 , 74 , 75 , 76 , 77 , 78 , 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 , 83 , 84 ,
85 , 86 ] and also applied to the supersymmetric theory [ 87 , 88 , 89 ,
90 ] or non-commutative spaces [ 91 , 92 ] .), but also in practically,
to reduce the numerical cost of calculating the overlap Dirac operator
both in quenched and unquenched simulations. Here we would like to make
two proposals that would avoid the appearance of @xmath modes or
topology changes. One is the modification of the gauge action and the
another is the additional fermion action.

For the former solution, one can construct a gauge action, which
generates link variables respecting the “admissibility” bound Eq.( 1.2 )
[ 27 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 ] . A simplest example is

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

Every “admissible” gauge configuration with very small @xmath keeps
@xmath and therefore, keeps topological structure of gauge fields. In
order to explain how “admissible” gauge fields can preserve the
topological charge, the best example would be the U(1) gauge theory in
two-dimensions, for which we can define an exact geometrical definition
of the topological charge [ 26 , 27 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath               
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.16)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

@xmath denotes the plaquette in the U(1) theory. In two dimensions,
@xmath gives an integer on the lattices with the periodic boundary
condition. Since the jump from @xmath to @xmath is allowed, the topology
can change easily. It is the U(1) version of the Lüscher’s admissibility
bound

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath , that can prevent these topology changes because the point
@xmath is excluded under this condition. Furthermore, it can be shown
that @xmath is equivalent to the index of the overlap fermion (with
@xmath ) if @xmath is satisfied. For the non-abelian gauge theories in
higher dimensions, we do not have the exact geometrical definition of
the topological charge. But it is quite natural to assume that a similar
mechanism concerning the compactness of the link variables allows us to
preserve the index of the overlap-Dirac operator for very small @xmath .
Note, however, that the value of @xmath is too tight for the simulation
with the cutoff around 2.0GeV. For practical purposes, we would like to
try much larger @xmath , as we still expect that the topology is
stabilized well in practical sampling of gauge configurations, even
though the topology change would not be prevented completely. It is also
notable that the difference between the gauge action Eq.( 2.15 ) and the
Wilson plaquette action is only of @xmath and one can safely take the
continuum limit. Also, the positivity which would be lost [ 93 ] at
cut-off scale by the restriction on the configuration space, is restored
as @xmath .

For another solution to suppress small eigenvalues of @xmath , the
additional fermion determinant

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (2.18)
  -- -------- -- --------

could be effective [ 40 , 42 , 39 ] . This determinant would prevent the
appearance of near zero-modes of @xmath , by giving small Boltzmann
weights to the configurations which have @xmath modes. Since it is
equivalent to adding 2-flavor Wilson fermion with a large negative mass
at cut-off scale, @xmath , it would not affect the low-energy physics,
and be decoupled like other fermion doublers. This additional
determinant may require more numerical cost than that of the gauge
action, Eq.( 2.15 ), but it would be negligible compared to the cost of
the dynamical overlap fermions.

## 3 Lattice simulations

In this section, we explain our setups for the numerical simulations.

### 3.1 Quenched QCD with admissible gauge fields

Although several types of the gauge action that generate the
“admissible” gauge fields satisfying the bound Eq.( 1.2 ) are proposed [
33 , 34 , 38 ] , we take the simplest choice: Eq.( 2.15 ). We use three
values of @xmath : 1, 2/3, and 0. Note that @xmath corresponds to the
conventional Wilson plaquette gauge action. The value @xmath is the
boundary, below this value the gauge links can take any value in the
gauge group @xmath (all configurations are admissible.) and the
positivity is guaranteed [ 93 ] .

The link fields are generated with the standard hybrid Monte Carlo
algorithm [ 25 ] (See appendix B ). The molecular dynamics step size
@xmath is taken in the range 0.01–0.02 and the number of steps in an
unit trajectory, @xmath , is 20–40. Every molecular dynamics step, we
check whether the condition @xmath is satisfied or not. In fact, no
violation of this bound was observed in our simulations. For
thermalization, we discarded at least 2000 trajectories before measuring
observables.

To generate topologically non-trivial gauge configurations, we use the
initial link variables,

  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------
     @xmath                  
     @xmath   @xmath         (3.1)
  -- -------- -------- -- -- -------

which is a discretized version of a classical solution with the
topological charge @xmath on a four-dimensional torus [ 94 ] . We
confirmed that the topological charge assigned in this way agrees with
the index of the overlap operator with @xmath = 0.6.

The simulation parameters and the plaquette expectation values (for the
run with the initial configuration with @xmath or 1) are summarized in
Table 1 . The length of unit trajectory is 0.07–0.4, and the step size
is chosen such that the acceptance rate is larger than @xmath 70%.

### 3.2 Cooling method to measure the topological charge

In order to measure the topological charge, we develop a new “cooling”
method. It is achieved by the hybrid Monte Carlo steps with an
exponentially increasing coupling, @xmath , and decreasing step size,
@xmath , as a function of trajectory, @xmath , i.e.

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.2)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

using the gauge action Eq.( 2.15 ) with fixed @xmath . Note that @xmath
is fixed in order to keep each step small. In this method, one can
“cool” the configuration smoothly, keeping the admissibility bound, Eq.(
1.2 ), with @xmath . The parameters are chosen as @xmath = (2.0, 0.01,
1) for the configurations generated with @xmath , and (3.5, 0.01, 2/3)
for the configurations with @xmath or @xmath . Even for the gauge fields
generated with the Wilson plaquette gauge action ( @xmath ), the
condition @xmath can be used because it allows all values of SU(3). The
link variables are cooled down after 50–200 steps close to a classical
solution in each topological sector. Then the geometrical definition of
the topological charge [ 95 ] ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

for the “cooled” configuration gives a number close to an integer times
a universal factor @xmath , namely, @xmath is close to an integer. The
value @xmath is calculated through would-be @xmath gauge configurations.
As Fig. 1 shows, the topological charge @xmath is consistent with the
index of the overlap-Dirac operator with @xmath = 0.6, which is measured
as described in Section 3.4 . The consistency seems better for @xmath
than for the standard Wilson plaquette action ( @xmath ).

### 3.3 Large negative mass Wilson fermion

Now let us discuss the lattice QCD with the determinant of Wilson
fermion with negative mass at cut-off scale @xmath as seen in Eq.( 2.18
). This is a more direct way to suppress the small eigenvalue of @xmath
, or keep topological charge, since the determinant @xmath would give a
very small Boltzmann weight if @xmath touches zero. For the gauge
action, we use the topology conserving action Eq.( 2.15 ) again with
three values of @xmath : 1, 2/3, and 0. We set the hopping parameter
@xmath , which is known to be an optimal choice for the locality of the
overlap Dirac operator [ 96 ] , and the conventional pseudo-fermion
method is performed in the hybrid Monte Carlo steps to calculate the
fermion determinant. For thermalization, we performed more than 500
trajectories before measuring observables.

The topological charge is evaluated in the same way as explained in the
previous subsection, namely, by the geometrical definition Eq.( 3.3 )
after 100-200 of the quenched HMC steps with increasing @xmath ,
switching off the Wilson fermion. Although the topological charge is
expected to be more stable in this method, there may be a large scaling
violation. Careful comparison with quenched studies without the
determinant would be important.

The simulation parameters are summarized in Table. 1

### 3.4 Numerical implementation of the overlap Dirac operator

For the overlap Dirac operator, Eq.( 2.1 ), we use the Wilson Dirac
Hamiltonian @xmath with @xmath , which is empirically known as an
optimal choice to suppress the small eigen-modes of @xmath at @xmath
2.0GeV in quenched QCD. The sign function is approximated by the
Chebyshev polynomial (See Fig. 2 );

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the function @xmath in the range [a,b] is written

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.5)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Note that the Chebyshev basis @xmath (of order @xmath ) satisfies the
orthogonal relation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

We use the numerical package ARPACK [ 97 ] , which implements the
implicitly restarted Arnoldi method, to measure the lowest eigenvalue
@xmath and the highest @xmath . In some cases, we calculate the 10
lowest modes explicitly, project them out of @xmath , and use the
approximation Eq.( 3.4 ) after the projection, in the range @xmath where
we use the 11th eigenvalue for the lower bound; @xmath .

In order to determine the order of the polynomial, @xmath , it is
important to note that the accuracy is expressed as a function of @xmath
and the condition number @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

for a random vector @xmath , where the constants @xmath and @xmath are
turned out to be independent of @xmath , @xmath and the lattice size
@xmath , as seen in Fig. 3 . Note that the lhs. of Eq.( 3.7 ) is zero
when the sign function is exact and the approximation breaks down when
@xmath .

We also use ARPACK to calculate the eigenvalues of @xmath and @xmath ,
where @xmath . The index can be obtained from the number of zero-modes
of chirally projected Dirac operators. To construct the non-zero mode,
@xmath , of @xmath , the formula

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (3.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

is useful.

## 4 Wilson loops and the static quark potential

In order to confirm the practical feasibility of the topology conserving
actions, Eq.( 2.15 ) and Eq.( 2.18 ), a careful comparison with the
Wilson plaquette action should be done. In this section, we study
gluonic quantities or Wilson loops to determine the lattice spacing, to
estimate the scaling violations due to the change in the actions, and to
test the perturbation theory with tadpole improved coupling. Then we can
judge whether our naive expectation that @xmath effect is small (of
order @xmath ) or the effect of the determinant, @xmath , is negligible,
is true or not.

### 4.1 The static quark potential

In the following, we assume that the topology of the gauge field does
not affect the Wilson loops when the lattice size is large, say @xmath
fm, and choose the run with @xmath or @xmath initial configuration for
the measurement.

Wilson loops, @xmath ’s, are measured using the smearing technique
according to [ 98 ] , where the spatial separation @xmath is taken to be
an integer multiples of vectors @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath and @xmath . Assuming the Wilson loop is an exponential function

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

for large @xmath , we extract the static quark potential @xmath . The
measurements are done every 20 trajectories and the errors are estimated
by the jackknife method.

As a reference scale to determine the lattice spacing, we evaluate the
Sommer scales @xmath and @xmath [ 99 , 100 ] defined by @xmath and
@xmath , respectively. The force @xmath on the lattice is given by a
differentiation of the potential in the direction of @xmath ;

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

for @xmath . @xmath is introduced to cancel @xmath errors in the short
distances at tree level,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

In Table 2 we present the values of the Sommer scales @xmath , @xmath ,
their ratio @xmath , and the lattice spacing @xmath (We assume @xmath
fm.). The data of @xmath and @xmath in the case that @xmath is an
integer multiples of @xmath are given in Tables 3 , 4 and 5 .

@xmath is a good quantity to estimate the scaling violation, comparing
with the value @xmath in the continuum limit, which was obtained with
the plaquette action [ 100 ] . Fig. 5 shows the @xmath dependence of
this ratio with different values of @xmath . The quenched results with
@xmath = 2/3 and 1 agree very well with Ref [ 100 ] except for the
coarsest lattice points around @xmath 0.1. Also in the case with @xmath
, as seen in Fig. 5 , any large scaling violation has not been seen
although the statistics are much poorer.

Fig. 7 presents the quark potential itself in a dimensionless
combination, i.e. @xmath as a function of @xmath . @xmath is evaluated
by an interpolation of the data in the direction @xmath . The data at
@xmath =1.3, @xmath in the quenched case and at @xmath , @xmath with
@xmath are plotted together with the curve representing the continuum
limit obtained in [ 100 ] . The agreement is satisfactory (less than two
sigma) for long distances @xmath 0.5. For short distances, on the other
hand, one can see deviations of order 10%, as shown in Fig. 7 , where
the ratio @xmath is plotted. @xmath represents the curve in the
continuum limit drawn in Fig. 7 . The plots at @xmath = @xmath and
@xmath obviously deviate from zero in the upward direction, while the
plots at @xmath and @xmath are lower than zero. This fact indicates the
rotational symmetry violation in a short distance. Let us concentrate on
the point @xmath as a function of the lattice spacing, as seen in Fig. 8
(left panel). We find that the size of the violation is quite similar to
that with Wilson plaquette action and independent of @xmath . One might
think that the rotational symmetry goes worse in the continuum limit,
but one should note the fact that the relevant scale of the observable
also diverges as @xmath . After a correction at the tree level by
introducing @xmath as @xmath , which is an analogue of @xmath in Eq.(
4.1 ) but is defined for the potential, we obtain the plot on the right
panel of Fig. 8 , where one can see an improvement. The remaining
deviation should be of order @xmath , which would vanish as @xmath near
the continuum limit. The data at @xmath with @xmath have larger
statistical errors but show a very similar behavior.

These observations show that both of scaling violations and rotational
symmetry violations are reasonable and the topology conserving actions
are feasible in the numerical studies.

Finally, we confirm our assumption that the topology does not affect the
quark potential by measuring @xmath for two initial value of @xmath (0
and @xmath ). Measurements are done on a @xmath lattice at @xmath =
1.42, @xmath = 1, for which the probability of the topology change is
extremely small as discussed in Sec. 5 . Our results are @xmath =
6.24(9) for the @xmath initial condition and 6.11(13) for @xmath .
Details are seen in Table. 6 .

### 4.2 Perturbative renormalization of the gauge coupling

From @xmath Wilson loop, @xmath , the so-called “mean field improved”
bare gauge coupling can be defined. In quenched study with the standard
Wilson plaquette action, it is known that the perturbation theory with
mean field improvement coupling converges very well. Here we would like
to define the mean field improved coupling with the topology conserving
gauge action, Eq.( 2.15 ), evaluate the coupling renormalization and see
its convergence in 2-loop perturbation theory.

Two-loop corrections to the gauge coupling for general one-plaquette
actions (constructed by the plaquette only and no rectangular term is
involved.) is calculated by Ellis et al. [ 101 ] . Using their formula,
the renormalized gauge couping @xmath defined in the “Manton” scheme is
given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath denotes the bare coupling and the coefficients @xmath and
@xmath are calculated as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.5)
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Here, the parameters are @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,
@xmath , and @xmath . The values of the next-to-leading and
next-to-next-to-leading order coefficients @xmath and @xmath , when
@xmath and 0, are given in Table 7 .

Let us define the mean field improved coupling @xmath by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

with the measured value of the plaquette expectation value @xmath (see
Table 1 ). It is defined from a coefficient of @xmath when we rewrite
@xmath and expand the action Eq.( 2.15 ) [ 102 ] .

A perturbative expectation value of the plaquette, or @xmath Wilson
loop, is evaluated with the general one-plaquette action by Heller et
al. [ 103 ] as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.7)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Here @xmath and @xmath are from the original calculation [ 104 ] for the
Wilson plaquette gauge action, and @xmath (on a symmetric lattice @xmath
) is introduced for generalization. Their values are @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath in the infinite volume limit. The constant @xmath is written

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath denotes the quadratic Casimir operator in a representation
@xmath of the group @xmath . @xmath is the dimension of the
representation @xmath , and @xmath is defined such that @xmath for the
group generator @xmath . The coupling @xmath is defined as a coupling
when we rewrite the gauge action in terms of a general form of the
one-plaquette action,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (4.9)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath denotes the plaquette variable in the @xmath
representation. The values of these parameters for the topology
conserving gauge action Eq.( 2.15 ) are

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.10)
  -- -------- -- --------

The other parameters are @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and
@xmath . With these numbers, we obtain @xmath and we finally get

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

Since the perturbative relation between the bare coupling @xmath and the
boosted coupling @xmath Eq.( 4.6 ) is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

one obtains the Manton coupling in terms of the boosted coupling as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (4.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

Numerical values of @xmath and @xmath are listed in Table 7 . One can
see the effect of the mean field improvement; the two-loop coefficient
@xmath is significantly reduced by reorganizing the perturbative
expansion as in Eq.( 4.14 ).

With these results, the Manton coupling is obtained for each lattice
parameters. In Fig. 9 , we plot the coupling evaluated at a reference
scale @xmath as a function of @xmath . We use the two-loop
renormalization equation to run @xmath to the reference scale. Although
@xmath is very different at the tree level, the one-loop results are
already in good agreement among the different values of @xmath . The
two-loop corrections show that the perturbative expansion converges very
well and a good agreement among different @xmath . Moreover, the scaling
toward the continuum limit seems also good in the two-loop level plots.

## 5 Stability of the topological charge

### 5.1 Admissibility condition and topology stability

As discussed in Sec. 2 , it is difficult to construct an exact and
practical geometrical definition of the topological charge for
non-Abelian theories, unless the gauge fields are very smooth [ 105 ]
(note that ( 3.3 ) gives non-integers). But even if we choose larger
@xmath , it is quite possible that the barriers among the topological
sectors are high enough to suppress topology changes for hundreds of HMC
trajectories, since any gauge action has a tendency to prevent the
topology transitions in the continuum limit.

In Table. 8 we present our data of the topological charge stability,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (5.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is the plaquette autocorrelation time, which is measured
according to Appendix E of [ 106 ] . @xmath denotes the total length of
the HMC trajectories and @xmath is the number of topology changes during
the trajectories. This definition, @xmath , gives a mean number of
uncorrelated gauge configurations which can be sampled without changing
the topology along the simulations. But we should mention that it only
gives an upper limit, because the topological charge is measured only
once per 10–20 trajectories and we may underestimate the topology
changes if @xmath jumps and returns quickly to the original value within
this interval. Therefore, @xmath is not reliable when the topology
change is very frequent.

In Fig. 10 the results are plotted as a function of the lattice spacing
squared. Clearly, one can see that the stability goes better as @xmath
increases when the lattice spacing is the same. Also, the stability gets
worse as the lattice size is increased from @xmath to @xmath . This is
no surprising, because the topology change occurs through local
dislocations of gauge field and its probability scales as the volume. An
important notice here is that the topological charge can be very stable
in any case in the continuum limit. The stability quickly rises as
@xmath .

To study QCD in the @xmath -regime in a fixed topological sector, the
lattices @xmath and @xmath would be appropriate. Their physical size is
around @xmath 1.25 fm and the topological charge is stable for @xmath
trajectories.

### 5.2 Negative mass Wilson fermion to fix topology

In contrast to the case with topology conserving gauge action Eq.( 2.15
), one expects that the fermion determinant, @xmath , can rigorously fix
the topology of gauge fields along the simulation. In fact, as Table. 8
shows, the topology change has never occurred in every run with
different parameters, which are chosen such that the lattice spacing is
around @xmath –0.1fm. Our data show that @xmath is unchanged for, at
least, 100-1000 @xmath trajectories, even if one ignores the
thermalization steps.

## 6 The effects on the overlap Dirac operator

### 6.1 Low-lying mode distribution of @xmath

As explained in Sec 3.4 , the order of Chebyshev polynomial
approximation, @xmath has to be proportional to the condition number,
@xmath , in order to keep a certain desired accuracy. Since both
topology conserving actions, Eq.( 2.15 ) and Eq.( 2.18 ) would play a
role to suppress the occurrence of low-lying eigenvalues of @xmath ,
they may be useful to reduce the numerical cost of calculating the
overlap Dirac operator.

Fig. 11 shows a typical comparison of the eigenvalue distribution on a
16 @xmath lattice. The values of @xmath and @xmath are chosen such that
the Sommer scale @xmath is roughly equal to 5 (left panel) and 6.5-7
(right panel) , which correspond to @xmath fm and @xmath fm
respectively. From the plot we observe that the density of the low-lying
modes is relatively small for larger values of @xmath in quenched case.
Let us discuss this more quantitatively. In Table 9 we list the
probability, @xmath , that a configuration has the lowest eigenvalue
lower than 0.1. For the above example (left panel), the probability is
74% for the standard Wilson gauge action ( @xmath , @xmath = 0 quenched
), but it decreases to 53% (47%) for @xmath = 2/3 (1)(quenched). It is
interesting to note that the data with @xmath show that the average of
@xmath is not so large, but the occurrence of very small eigenvalues
@xmath 0.1 is strongly suppressed. The lowest eigenvalue in these
configurations is 1.2e-03 in the quenched case at @xmath and @xmath ,
while it is 0.042 in the case with @xmath at @xmath and @xmath .

Also, for another lattice spacing ( @xmath 6.5) and lattice size @xmath
, a similar trend can be seen. In Table 9 we also present the ensemble
average of the lowest eigenvalue @xmath and the inverse of condition
numbers @xmath and @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath denote the 10th and
the highest eigenvalues respectively. We may conclude that the lowest
eigenvalue is higher in average when we use the topology conserving
actions. In the numerical implementation of the overlap-Dirac operator,
the low-lying eigen-modes of @xmath are often subtracted and treated
exactly. Then the higher mode contributions are approximated by some
polynomial or rational functions. Here, we assume that 10 lowest
eigen-modes are subtracted and compare the relative numerical cost on
the gauge configurations with different values of @xmath . From Table 9
we observe that the reduced condition number is about a factor 1.2–1.4
smaller for @xmath = 1 than that for the standard Wilson gauge action.

We also check that the above observation does not change when one shifts
the value of @xmath in a reasonable range. In Fig. 12 , a typical
distributions of the low-lying eigen-modes for @xmath = 0.2–0.7 are
plotted. We find that the advantage of the topology conserving actions
does not change. Also, from these plots we can see that @xmath is nearly
optimal for all the cases.

### 6.2 Locality

When we talk about the locality of the overlap-Dirac operator, it means
that the norm @xmath with a point source vector @xmath at @xmath should
decay exponentially as a function of @xmath [ 29 ]

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (6.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath and @xmath are constants. Actually we observe this
property, as seen in Fig. 13 . The plot shows the results for different
values of @xmath at the lattice scales @xmath 5.3 (left) and 6.5
(right). We find no remarkable difference on the locality when we change
@xmath .

Recently, it has been indicated that the mobility edge is more crucial
quantity which governs the locality of the overlap-Dirac operator [ 69 ,
70 , 71 , 72 , 73 ] . It would be interesting and important to see the
dependence of the mobility edge on the parameters in the topology
conserving actions, which should be done in the future works.

## 7 Lattice QCD in the @xmath-regime with fixed @xmath

In previous sections we have discussed the topology conserving actions
which might be helpful to the full QCD simulation with the overlap
fermion determinant. Here we would like to show great uses of the
overlap Dirac operator itself to measure physical observables. Once a
set of configurations of @xmath or 3 full QCD is generated, it would be
much easier and more reliable to extract physical quantities such as
pion mass, decay constants, Kaon bag parameters, and so on, using the
overlap Dirac operator which respects the “exact” chiral symmetry. One
of attractive numerical applications would be the so-called @xmath
-regime, where both of chiral symmetry and topology have significant
effects on the observables.

In this section we demonstrate the analysis of quenched lattice QCD in
the @xmath -regime to determine the low energy constants of the quenched
chiral perturbation theory (qChPT). Of course, both quenched QCD and
qChPT are unphysical and the data of pion decay constant or the chiral
condensate have little relation to the true value of them in nature.
However, this quenched study is still interesting to see how these
low-energy constants can be extracted when the full QCD simulation is
established in the future.

### 7.1 Meson correlators in the @xmath-regime

It is believed that the low energy limit of QCD is described by the pion
effective theory, or (q)ChPT. To determine the fundamental parameters of
(q)ChPT is one of relevant issues of lattice QCD. In the so-called
@xmath -regime [ 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ] , where the size of the
space-time box is smaller than the pion Compton wave length; @xmath (but
larger than the QCD scale @xmath , which should be guaranteed so that
the pion can be treated as a point particle and other heavier hadrons
are decoupled.), (q)ChPT with a expansion parameter @xmath , is still
applicable. Here @xmath is a cutoff scale of the chiral Lagrangian
roughly around 1 GeV. An important notice is that the low energy
constants in (q)ChPT are defined at the cutoff scale and it does not
depend on whether the system is in the @xmath -regime or the large
volume regime. Therefore, once @xmath or @xmath are determined in the
@xmath -regime, one can use them in the standard (q)ChPT in a larger
volume. Analytic calculations of meson correlation functions in the
@xmath -regime have been widely studied for both ChPT and qChPT [ 107 ,
108 , 109 ] .

In the quenched case, the fundamental parameters of the effective theory
are the pion decay constant, @xmath , the chiral condensate, @xmath ,
the singlet mass, @xmath , and the coefficient of an additional singlet
kinetic term, @xmath . Here we just present some results of 1-loop
calculation, which are relevant to our numerical study. The details of
calculation and the definition of the functions and coefficients are
summarized in Appendix C . The scalar condensate at 1-loop level in
@xmath topological sector is given by

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

The triplet axial vector, scalar and pseudo-scalar correlators are given
by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.2)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.3)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.4)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

The singlet scalar and pseudo-scalar correlators are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.5)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.6)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

As mentioned in Appendix C , the results are valid only when @xmath is
small, which is a particular restriction of quenching the fermion
determinant.

As these equations of qChPT show, the meson correlators in the @xmath
-regime should be quite sensitive to the topological charge and the
fermion mass. These prominent @xmath and @xmath dependences are used to
evaluate the low energy constants, or namely, we fit our lattice data
with the above equations, in which @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath
are treated as free parameters. The parameter @xmath always appears
associated with the quark mass @xmath as @xmath is renormalization scale
and scheme independent. The value of @xmath in the following analysis
should be understood as a bare quantity in the lattice regularization at
a scale @xmath . To relate them with the conventional scheme such as the
@xmath scheme requires perturbative or non-perturbative matching, which
is beyond the scope of this work.

### 7.2 Lattice observables with the exact chiral symmetry

We generate gauge link variables at @xmath and @xmath in the quenched
approximation on a @xmath lattice. The spacial length @xmath of the box
is about 1.23 fm. We employ the massive Dirac operator for the valence
quark,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the bare quark mass are chosen to be very small; @xmath 0.0016,
0.0032, 0.0048, 0.0064, 0.008, which corresponds 2.6–13MeV. The number
of configurations for each topological sector is given in Table 10 . We
analyze the gauge configurations in @xmath sectors.

When the exact inversion of the overlap-Dirac operator is needed, we use
the techniques described in Ref. [ 53 ] ; for a given source vector
@xmath , we solve the equation

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (7.8)
  -- -------- -- -------

by separating the left and right handed components as @xmath and solving
two equations

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.9)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.10)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

consecutively. (The above equations apply to positive @xmath cases and
the same procedure applies with a replacement @xmath to negative @xmath
cases.) The conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm is used to invert the
chirally projected matrices with the low-mode preconditioning in which
20 lowest eigen-modes are subtracted.

As one of special features of finite volume regime, a remarkable
low-mode dominance in the chiral limit is expected [ 110 , 111 , 112 ] .
Using ARPACK [ 97 ] again, we calculate 200 + @xmath lowest mode
eigenvalues and their eigenfunctions of the overlap Dirac operator. The
index @xmath is calculated at the same time. Note that these eigenvalues
cover more than 15% of the circle in the complex space of the
eigenvalues of @xmath as Fig. 14 shows. Then, the inverse of the overlap
operator is decomposed as

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.11)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath ’s are eigenvalues of @xmath and @xmath ’s are their
eigenvectors. We set @xmath . In the following analysis, we often use
the low-mode approximation of the expectation value (We will denote
@xmath instead of a simple bracket.) by inserting the low-mode part
only,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.12)
  -- -------- -- --------

to the propagators. This would be valid only when it is proved that the
higher mode’s contributions are sufficiently small or can be canceled in
the combination of different operators. An great advantage of using
@xmath instead of exact @xmath is that the inversion at any @xmath and
@xmath is obtained without performing the CG algorithm, so that one can
easily average the correlators over the space-time arguments, like

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath denotes some gamma matrix. This so-called low-mode
averaging dramatically reduces the fluctuation of the correlators as
shown in Fig. 15 , which is also reported in Refs. [ 113 , 57 ] .

### 7.3 Numerical results

#### 7.3.1 @xmath from the axial-vector correlator

First let us consider the axial-vector current correlator ( 7.2 ), which
is most sensitive to @xmath and not contaminated by the parameters
@xmath and @xmath . Here we do not use the low-mode approximation
because 200+ @xmath modes are not sufficient to estimate the total
propagator, as the left panel of Fig. 16 shows.

A naive definition of the axial vector current is @xmath , constructed
from the overlap fermion field @xmath . Note that it is not the
conserved current associated with the lattice chiral symmetry, and
(finite) renormalization is needed to relate it to the continuum
axial-vector current. We follow the method applied in Refs. [ 114 , 115
] to calculate the @xmath factor non-perturbatively. Namely, we
calculate

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

where @xmath denotes a symmetric lattice derivative and @xmath ⁵ ⁵ 5 We
should use the chirally improved operator, @xmath , but for the on-shell
matrix elements such as the one considered here, one can use the
equation of motion to replace the @xmath by @xmath , which is negligible
for our quark masses. We therefore use the local operator for @xmath . .

Fitting the average of @xmath over all topological sectors with a
constant in the range @xmath , we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

at four quark masses @xmath = 0.0016, 0.0048, 0.008, 0.016, as plotted
in Fig. 17 , which shows a very good chiral behavior. With a quadratic
fit we obtain

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.16)
  -- -------- -- --------

The constant term is perfectly consistent with zero and we extract an
accurate value, @xmath = 1.439(15) , which is consistent with the value
@xmath = 1.448(4) reported in Ref. [ 116 ] which was done with the same
@xmath and @xmath .

Now one can compare the renormalized axial-vector correlation function
with the qChPT result

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.17)
  -- -------- -- --------

to extract @xmath and @xmath . In Ref. [ 55 ] it is reported that the
correlators suffer from large statistical fluctuation when @xmath and
the data in the other topological sectors are insensitive to @xmath ,
but it turned out that two-parameter ( @xmath and @xmath ) fitting does
work well when we treat the data of different topology and fermion
masses simultaneously. As shown in Fig. 18 , our data at @xmath =
0.0016, 0.0048, 0.008 in the @xmath sectors are well described by the
qChPT formula ( 7.17 ). A simultaneous fit in the range @xmath yields
@xmath = 98.3(8.3) MeV and @xmath = 259(50) MeV with @xmath = 0.19. The
result for @xmath is in a good agreement with that of the previous work
[ 57 ] , 102(4) MeV.

On the other hand, the correlators at @xmath = 2 do not agree with the
above fit parameters as shown in Fig. 19 . As discussed before, it may
indicate that the topological sector @xmath = 2 is already too large to
apply the qChPT in the @xmath -regime.

#### 7.3.2 @xmath, @xmath and @xmath from connected S and PS correlators

We find that the scalar and pseudo-scalar triplet correlators are
approximated precisely with the lowest 200 @xmath eigen-modes at small
quark masses ( @xmath = 2.6–13 MeV) as the right panel of Fig. 16 shows.
In the range @xmath , the systematic error of this low-mode
approximation is estimated to be only @xmath for the scalar correlators
in @xmath sectors and the pseudo-scalar correlators in all the
topological sectors. In this way we measure

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.18)
     @xmath      (7.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

at @xmath = 0.0016, 0.0032, 0.0048, 0.0064, and 0.008. We take an
average of the source point @xmath over @xmath lattice sites. In qChPT
formulas ( 7.3 ) and ( 7.4 ), we have five parameters to be determined:
@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . Since these correlators
are weakly depending on @xmath , we use the jackknife samples of @xmath
obtained from the axial-vector current correlator, @xmath =
98.3(8.3) MeV. Unfortunately, there still remain too many parameters to
fit with qChPT expressions. Therefore, we use the relation ( C.13 ) and
an input @xmath from a recent work [ 117 ] , which gives @xmath =
940(80)(23) MeV, where the second error reflects the error of @xmath .

With these input values, we fit the correlators ( 7.18 ) and ( 7.19 ) in
the range @xmath at different @xmath and @xmath simultaneously. Fig. 20
shows the correlators with fitting curves. For @xmath sectors, the data
at all available quark masses @xmath = 0.0016, 0.0032, 0.0064 and 0.008
are fitted well, and we actually get @xmath @xmath 0.7. (Note that the
correlations between different @xmath ’s, @xmath ’s and channels (PS and
S) are not taken into account.) This fit yields @xmath = 257 @xmath 14
@xmath 00 MeV, which is consistent with Ref. [ 96 ] , @xmath = 271
@xmath 12 @xmath 00 MeV, and @xmath = @xmath 4.5 @xmath 1.2 @xmath 0.2,
where the first error is the statistical error and the second one is
from uncertainty of @xmath .

Here are some remarks. The ratio

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

should indicate the size of the NLO correction in the @xmath expansion.
Our data, 1.163(59), implies that the @xmath expansion is actually
converging. @xmath has large negative value, which is also reported in
Refs. [ 118 ] and [ 35 ] . These results contradict with a previous
precise calculation [ 119 ] , which obtained a smaller value @xmath =
0.03(3). If we instead assume @xmath = 0, and fit the data with @xmath
as a free parameter, we obtain @xmath = 136.9(5.3) MeV and @xmath and
@xmath are almost unchanged. (Detailed numbers are summarized in Table
11 .) A possible cause is that @xmath is not small enough to derive the
partition function Eq.( C ) (See Appendix C ). Eq.( C.13 ) may also have
a systematic error due to finite @xmath as well as finite @xmath . Look
at the data with @xmath = 2, which are plotted in Fig. 20 . They do not
agree with expectations from the qChPT shown by dashed curves in the
plots, which is also seen in the case with the axial-vector correlators.
A simultaneous fit with all the data including @xmath = 0, 1 and 2 gives
a bad @xmath ( @xmath 12). Thus our numerical data might be posing a
problem whether the partition function of qChPT @xmath is reliable or
not, when @xmath is not satisfied very much; @xmath on our lattice.

#### 7.3.3 Chiral condensates

Consider the low-mode contribution to the scalar and pseudo-scalar
condensates with a fixed topological charge @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.21)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            
              @xmath   @xmath            
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

If @xmath is large enough, the higher mode contribution, @xmath , should
be insensitive to the link variables @xmath if @xmath and thus to the
global structure of the gauge field configuration, such as the
topological charge. We, therefore, expect that the difference of the
scalar condensates with different topology can be approximated with
low-modes,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.23)
  -- -------- -- --------

In fact, Fig. 21 shows that the convergence up to @xmath is really good.
For the pseudo-scalar condensate, the situation is much easier, since
the condensate is determined by the zero modes only;

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.24)
  -- -------- -- --------

Note that the contributions from non-zero eigen-modes cancel because of
the orthogonality among different eigenvectors. As shown in Fig. 22 ,
our data with @xmath low-modes perfectly agree with this theoretical
expectation.

The free parameter in the scalar condensate is @xmath as seen in ( 7.1 )
and ( C.16 ). We compare our numerical result of Eq.( 7.23 ) with the
qChPT result @xmath . We use the low-mode averaging over @xmath lattice
sites. Fig. 23 shows the results as a function of quark mass for @xmath
= 1, 2 and 3. The lattice data agree remarkably well with the qChPT
expectation with @xmath = 271(12) MeV as determined from the
(pseudo-)scalar connected correlators as presented in the previous
section. In fact, if we fit these data with @xmath as a free parameter,
we obtain 256(14) MeV which is consistent with the result above.

#### 7.3.4 Disconnected PS correlators

Let us rewrite the disconnected pseudo-scalar correlator in a fixed
topological sector,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.25)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where @xmath . Here we assume that higher mode’s contribution does not
have correlation with any local operator @xmath separated enough from
@xmath , i.e.

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (7.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

where the expectation value @xmath represents insensitivity to the
topological charge. We also use the translational invariance @xmath .
Since we know @xmath , the above equation should be well approximated
with low-modes. In fact, Fig. 24 shows a very good convergence with the
lowest 200+ @xmath eigen-modes. Similar results were also obtained
previously in the study of the @xmath propagator with the Wilson fermion
[ 111 ] and with the overlap fermion [ 120 ] .

In the qChPT the correlator is written as

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.27)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

where

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.28)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

In Fig. 25 , we present the data in @xmath = 0–3 topological sectors at
two representative quark masses @xmath = 0.0032 and 0.0064. The qChPT
predictions are plotted with the parameters determined from the
axial-vector and (pseudo-)scalar connected correlators: @xmath =
257 MeV, @xmath = 98.3 MeV, @xmath = 940 MeV, and @xmath = @xmath 4.5.
One finds that the agreement is marginal, though the correlator’s
magnitude and shape are qualitatively well described. Instead, if we fit
the disconnected correlator with @xmath and @xmath as free parameters
while fixing @xmath and @xmath to the same value, we obtain @xmath =
227(32) MeV and @xmath = @xmath 3.5(1.2), which are statistically
consistent with those input numbers. We conclude that not only the
connected correlators, but also disconnected correlators can be
consistently expressed by the qChPT in the @xmath -regime when @xmath is
small. Details of the fit results are listed in Table 11 .

## 8 Conclusions and discussions

The exact chiral symmetry is established on the lattice, with the
overlap Dirac operator which satisfies the Ginsparg-Wilson relation.
However, the overlap Dirac operator becomes ill-defined at certain
points where the zero-mode of @xmath appears. Also, practically, these
points make the numerical study very difficult. One has to carefully
evaluate the discontinuity of the overlap fermion determinant
(reflection/refraction) and the polynomial or rational expression of the
overlap Dirac operator itself goes worse near this discontinuity. In
fact, these dangerous points are topology boundaries; it is known that
crossing @xmath changes the index of the overlap Dirac operator, or
topological charge.

In the continuum limit, @xmath is automatically excluded but it would be
better if we can construct the lattice gauge theory which does not allow
@xmath from the beginning with a finite lattice spacing. There have been
proposed two promising strategies. One is the gauge action which
satisfies Lüscher’s “admissibility” condition and the other is an
additional fermion determinant, @xmath . Both of them are designed for
the use of the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm, in which global and small
(smooth) updates are performed. Therefore, we regard them as “topology
conserving actions”. In this thesis, we have investigated the
possibility of lattice QCD in a fixed topological sector. We studied the
properties of the topology conserving actions with no light quarks
(namely, pure @xmath theory.). Although the admissibility condition with
small @xmath ( @xmath 1/20) can strictly prohibit the topology changes,
our interest is the case with @xmath for practical purposes. In the
(quenched) Hybrid Monte Carlo updates, we found that the topology change
is strongly suppressed for @xmath = 2/3 and 1, compared to the standard
Wilson plaquette gauge action. The topological charge seems more stable
for finer lattices, and it is possible to preserve the topological
charge for O(100)-O(1,000) HMC trajectories at @xmath 0.08 fm and @xmath
1.3 fm, which might be applicable to the @xmath -regime. The action Eq.(
2.15 ) has, thus, been proved to be useful to accumulate gauge
configurations in a fixed topological sector. While the gauge action
Eq.( 2.15 ) with @xmath and 2/3 allows the topology changes, at times,
the topology conservation with the fermion determinant @xmath seems
perfect. The numerical cost for this determinant is, of course, much
more expensive than the quenched case, but it would be negligible
compared to the cost of the dynamical overlap fermion. The full QCD
overlap fermion simulation with the additional determinant @xmath may be
very efficient, if we can omit the reflection/refraction procedures.

To test their practical feasibility, we measured the heavy quark
potential with these actions. The lattice spacing is determined from the
Sommer scale @xmath . With these measurements we also investigated the
scaling violation at short and intermediate distances. The probe in the
short range is the violation of the rotational symmetry, and a ratio
@xmath of two different scale can be used for the intermediate distance.
For both of these we found that the size of the scaling violation is
comparable to the case with the Wilson plaquette gauge action, which is
consistent with the expectation that the term with @xmath introduces a
difference at most @xmath or the additional large negative mass Wilson
fermions are decoupled. These actions show no disadvantage as far as
Wilson loops are concerned. We also found that the perturbative
expansion of the coupling (after mean-field improvement) shows very good
convergence even if @xmath term is introduced. The coupling constant in
a certain scheme at a given scale is consistent among different values
of @xmath .

As another advantage of the (approximate) topology conservation, the
low-lying eigenvalues of the Wilson-Dirac operator in the negative mass
regime is suppressed. This reduces the cost of the numerical
implementation of the overlap-Dirac operator. We observed that the
topology conserving actions have a gain about a factor 2–3 at the same
lattice spacing compared to the standard Wilson gauge action. Comparison
with the other improved gauge actions, such as the Lüscher-Weisz,
Iwasaki and DBW2 would be interesting.

In a fixed topological sector, one of the very interesting applications
would be the QCD in the @xmath -regime. In the chiral limit, the (q)ChPT
analysis shows that the meson correlators are largely affected by the
fermion zero-modes, and thus by the topology of the background gauge
field. In order to study lattice QCD in such a regime, the chiral
symmetric Dirac operator is essential, otherwise the large lattice
artifacts would contaminate the fundamental points of the analysis, such
as the definition of the topological charge, or what is the zero-mode,
etc. To demonstrate how much effective the overlap Dirac operator is, we
studied the quenched QCD with very small quark masses in the range
@xmath –13MeV. In this chiral regime, we observed that the chiral
behavior is really nice, as seen in, for example, accurate determination
of @xmath , or the pseudo-scalar condensates @xmath . We also found the
importance of the low lying modes and used them to extract the
low-energy constants. (Note that the low lying modes are not affected by
the @xmath limit, since it would add higher modes only, which are
irrelevant to the low energy dynamics.) From triplet meson correlators
with @xmath and 1, we extracted @xmath = 98.3(8.3) MeV, @xmath =
257(14)(00) MeV ( @xmath = 271(12)(00) MeV), @xmath = 940(80)(23) MeV,
and @xmath = @xmath 4.5(1.2)(0.2). In these numerical results the second
error reflects the error of @xmath . We also obtained consistent results
from disconnected pseudo-scalar correlator and the chiral condensates.
Although we observed minor inconsistencies and problems due to finite
@xmath correction, which is a special restriction of the quenched ChPT,
these remarkable successes would encourage us to go further to @xmath
full QCD in the @xmath -regime.

The exact chiral symmetry with the overlap Dirac operator is surely a
most remarkable progress in the lattice gauge theory and it would be
more and more important in both of the numerical works and theoretical
works, in the future. In order to perform the path integrals, one
should, however, note the fact that there is several points where @xmath
has zero modes, which makes the overlap Dirac operator ill-defined, its
locality is doubtful, and the numerical cost is suddenly enhanced. Our
observation shows that the lattice QCD with fixed topology would be one
of interesting and promising solutions to this. A number of applications
such as @xmath -vacuum, finite temperatures, and so on, might be
possible as well.

For the future works, we would like to give a few remarks.

We have observed a large @xmath -shift when the negative mass Wilson
fermion Eq.( 2.18 ) is added, which may also cause a unwanted large
scaling violation. We thus propose another “topology stabilizer” which
would have effects on @xmath modes only;

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.1)
  -- -------- -- -------

where the denominator is corresponding to the twisted mass ghost [ 121 ,
122 , 123 ]

with a large negative mass @xmath and a small twisted mass @xmath . The
effect from both determinant should be canceled unless @xmath has small
eigenvalues. Note that @xmath with @xmath fixed.

As a final remark, let us consider the contribution from different
topological sectors. In each topological sector, one measures the
expectation value of operator @xmath with a fixed topological charge,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.2)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where @xmath denotes the integral over the gauge fields with topological
charge @xmath and @xmath is the determinant of @xmath flavor overlap
fermion with quark mass @xmath . In order to calculate the total
expectation value (in @xmath -vacuum);

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.3)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

the ratio @xmath has to be evaluated. In fact, there are several
proposals to calculate this ratio of the partition function, including
the tempering method [ 124 , 125 , 126 , 127 , 128 ] . Here, we would
like to propose an easier method. With an assumption that the ratio
should be Gaussian;

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

in a large volume @xmath , one only has to calculate the topological
susceptibility [ 129 , 130 ] ,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.5)
  -- -------- -- -------

to evaluate the ratio @xmath with any value of @xmath . In principle,
the topological susceptibility can be evaluated with the local
topological charge density operator @xmath in a semi-local region
(assuming the cluster decomposition principle);

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.6)
  -- -------- -- -------

where @xmath is performed over the small volume @xmath around the
origin, where @xmath . Thus, if the topological susceptibility in a
fixed topological sector,

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (8.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

shows sufficiently small @xmath dependence and the finite volume effects
due to @xmath and @xmath are both negligible, then @xmath should be a
good approximation of @xmath ⁶ ⁶ 6 In this argument we omit the
renormalization or mixing of @xmath for simplicity. . What we would like
to emphasize here is that summing up all the topology with the weight
@xmath (in a @xmath -vacuum) is not so difficult and maybe not so
important unless @xmath term is considered ⁷ ⁷ 7 In Ref. [ 131 ] , it is
shown that the observables in a fixed topology are equivalent to those
in the @xmath vacuum up to correction terms proportional to @xmath . ,
since @xmath , although the numerical studies has to be done in the
future works to verify this quite optimistic argument. It seems an
appropriate way to preserve the topology along the simulations, since
any lattice gauge action would eventually create large barriers between
the topological sectors in the continuum limit.

## Appendix B The hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm

We explain how to generate the configurations in our numerical
simulations. The hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm (HMC) is one of the most
efficient [ 25 ] algorithms and widely used in the lattice QCD studies.

Consider updating fields, @xmath ’s, which have an action @xmath . The
HMC algorithm consists of two parts;

1.  generate a candidate of updating field @xmath .

2.  judge whether @xmath is accepted or rejected.

The former is called molecular dynamics steps, since it is very similar
to the trajectory of a classical particle, randomly walking in
configuration space, of which path is determined by the equation of
motion;

  -- -------- -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      @xmath      (B.1)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- -------

where the initial momentum @xmath is randomly given with probability
density

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.2)
  -- -------- -- -------

The final point, @xmath , obtained in this way (after a fixed ’time’
@xmath ), is chosen to be the candidate @xmath . This step is known to
satisfy “the detailed balance” which is a sufficient condition for an
algorithm to sample the distribution with the correct Boltzmann weight
@xmath . However, in the numerical studies, the evolution is done by the
leap-frog updates with a finite step-size @xmath ,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (B.3)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

Therefore, one needs the latter procedure, or the Metropolis test, to
judge that the new configuration is accepted or not; @xmath is accepted
with probability

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

which realizes the exact detailed-balance. The above steps ( @xmath
molecular dynamics steps with the step-size @xmath and the Metropolis
test) are done in every ’trajectory’. In this way, the configurations
are generated performing the hundreds or thousands of trajectories,
@xmath .

Let us consider the path integral

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.5)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where the pseudo-fermion field @xmath is introduced to evaluate the
fermion determinant @xmath , which can not be directly calculated when
the lattice size is large.

Since the pseudo-fermion part of the action is a simple bilinear, @xmath
can be updated with a conventional heat-bath algorithm. The HMC
algorithm is applied to updating the link fields @xmath ’s with fixed
@xmath which is generated by the heat-bath method;

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.6)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

Thus, our lattice QCD simulation is performed as follows,

1.  Choose a starting link variable configuration.

2.  Choose @xmath to be a field of Gaussian noise (heat-bath).

3.  Choose the momentum of link variables, @xmath from a Gaussian noise.

4.  @xmath molecular dynamics with the step-size @xmath are done.

5.  Accept or reject the new configuration (Metropolis test).

6.  Store the (new or old) configuration.

7.  Return to step 2.

Note that both of

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (B.7)
  -- -------- -- -------

involves the calculation of @xmath , which requires a very expensive
computational cost in the chiral limit, @xmath , since a lot of low
eigenvalues appear. Also, it is notable that when @xmath is not smooth
with respect to the gauge link field @xmath , sudden jumps of momentum
evolution in Eq.( B.3 ) should be monitored, otherwise over(under)
estimation of the momentum would break the algorithm. Finally, we should
refer to the fact that each step of HMC is small variation of the
fields, and therefore, tends to keep the initial topological properties
of the link variables.

## Appendix C Quenched chiral perturbation theory in the @xmath-regime

This appendix is devoted to a brief review of quenched chiral
perturbation theory (qChPT) in the @xmath -regime [ 107 ] and we
summarize the relevant formulas for our analysis of meson correlation
functions.

The partition function of qChPT with @xmath valence quarks is defined

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.1)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------

where the Lagrangian @xmath is given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (C.2)
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

at the leading order of pion mass, @xmath , and pion momentum, @xmath ,
expansion, where @xmath denotes the number of color, @xmath is the pion
decay constant and @xmath is the chiral condensate. @xmath is integrated
over a sub-manifold of the super-group @xmath , called the maximally
symmetric Riemannian sub-manifold which is characterized by a matrix of
form

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.3)
  -- -------- -- -------

and Grassmannian @xmath matrices @xmath and @xmath . Str denotes the
super-trace. The quark mass is involved in the mass matrix @xmath where
@xmath and @xmath are the identity matrix in the fermion-fermion and
boson-boson blocks respectively. The @xmath term which violates CP
symmetry, enters through @xmath . Note that in the quenched
approximation the singlet field @xmath is not decoupled, and its mass
@xmath and coupling @xmath are introduced [ 132 ] .

The @xmath -regime [ 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ] is a special regime
where the quark mass is so small that the pion Compton wavelength @xmath
is larger than the linear extent of the space-time @xmath . In this
regime, the zero mode of pion gives important contribution and one must
explicitly integrate out the constant mode of @xmath . The other mode’s
contributions are perturbatively evaluated with the expansion parameter,
@xmath . Namely, separating the zero mode and the other modes;

  -- -------- -- -------
     @xmath      (C.4)
  -- -------- -- -------

the Lagrangian Eq.( C.2 ) can be rewritten. Together with @xmath
-expansion, one obtains the partition function with a fixed topological
charge @xmath by Fourier transforming ( C.1 ) as follows,

  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (C.5)
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                                @xmath   
                       @xmath   @xmath   
                                @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------

where we use

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.6)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.7)

     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.9)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.10)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

In the last line of ( C.5 ), we perform @xmath integral as a Gaussian;

  -- -------- -- -------- -------- --------
     @xmath                        (C.11)
                                   
                 @xmath   @xmath   
                 @xmath   @xmath   
  -- -------- -- -------- -------- --------

where @xmath and @xmath . We need a condition, @xmath , in order to
justify this Gaussian integral, otherwise the integral Eq.( C.11 )
should depend on @xmath , which means that @xmath and @xmath can not be
treated independently and the last line of the partition function Eq.(
C.5 ) is invalid. Therefore, all the results shown below are reliable
only for small @xmath .

With redefinition @xmath , the partition function in a fixed topological
sector is obtained

  -- -------- -------- -------- --
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   
              @xmath   @xmath   
                       @xmath   
  -- -------- -------- -------- --

where @xmath denotes the Haar measure of the maximally Riemannian
sub-manifold of
@xmath . Note that the topological charge distributes as a Gaussian with
variance

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.13)
  -- -------- -- --------

which is in a good contrast with the full theory, for which @xmath is
expected with @xmath flavors.

In the following we consider @xmath = 1 and 2 cases only, as we are
interested in the system with two light quarks. Any correlators or
condensates are obtained by the perturbation of @xmath fields and the
exact integration over zero mode, @xmath , which can be written in terms
of the Bessel functions.

First let us calculate the condensates. At the tree-level the scalar
condensate is given by

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.14)
  -- -------- -- --------

with @xmath . @xmath and @xmath denote the modified Bessel functions.
One-loop contribution does not change its functional form [ 133 ]

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.15)
  -- -------- -- --------

but the parameters @xmath and @xmath are shifted to @xmath and @xmath :

  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      @xmath      (C.16)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------

Here, parameters @xmath and @xmath are ultraviolet divergent tadpole
integrals,

  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      @xmath      (C.17)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------

which need renormalization.

Next, we consider the flavor-singlet meson operators

  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      @xmath      (C.18)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------

To add these operators to the QCD Lagrangian as source terms;

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.19)
  -- -------- -- --------

corresponds to the substitution

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.20)
  -- -------- -- --------

in qChPT. The two-point correlation functions are obtained by
differentiating the generating functional by @xmath and @xmath . To
@xmath the results are

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.21)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.22)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      @xmath      (C.23)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------

and the constant terms are given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath               (C.24)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.25)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

Note that the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath ,

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.26)
  -- -------- -- --------

For flavor non-singlet case, we need a @xmath super-group integral,
which is also described with the Bessel functions. The non-singlet
operators are given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.27)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.28)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

with the Pauli matrices @xmath . To @xmath the two-point functions are
given by

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.29)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.30)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

where

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.31)
  -- -------- -- --------

and

  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      @xmath      (C.32)
  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------

For the flavor non-singlet axial-vector current

  -- -------- -- --------
     @xmath      (C.33)
  -- -------- -- --------

the correlator is obtained [ 108 ]

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.34)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

An important observation here is that the axial-current correlator does
not depend on the parameters related to the quenched artifact, i.e.
@xmath and @xmath . Also note that the constant term is proportional to
@xmath rather than @xmath . Therefore, this channel is suitable for an
extraction of @xmath , whereas for the pseudo-scalar and scalar
correlators @xmath appears only in the coefficients of @xmath and @xmath
terms.

For zero spatial momentum projection, it is convenient to define

  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.35)
     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.36)
  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------

As a Remarkable feature in the @xmath -regime, the correlators do not
behave as the usual exponential fall-off @xmath with the mass gap @xmath
.
