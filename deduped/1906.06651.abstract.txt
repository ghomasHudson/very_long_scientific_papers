In this thesis, we mainly investigate the lattice coding problem of the
downlink communication between a base station and multiple users. The base
station broadcasts a message containing each user's intended message. The
capacity limit of such a system setting is already well-known while the design
of practical coding and modulation schemes to approach the theoretical limit
has not been fully studied and investigated in the literature. This thesis
attempts to address this problem by providing a systematic design on lattice
coding and modulation schemes for downlink multiuser communication systems. The
main idea is to exploit the structure property of lattices to harness
interference from downlink users.
