More than a speculative technology, quantum computing seems to challenge our
most basic intuitions about how the physical world should behave. In this
thesis I show that, while some intuitions from classical computer science must
be jettisoned in the light of modern physics, many others emerge nearly
unscathed; and I use powerful tools from computational complexity theory to
help determine which are which.
