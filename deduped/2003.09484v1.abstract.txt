Algorithmic methods for the explicit inversion of the indefinite double
covering maps are proposed. These are based on either the Givens decomposition
or the polar decomposition of the given matrix in the proper, indefinite
orthogonal group with signature (p,q). As a by-product we establish that the
preimage in the covering group, of a positive matrix in the proper, indefinite
orthogonal group, can itself be chosen to be positive definite. Inversion
amounts to solving a polynomial system in several variables. Our methods solve
this system by either inspection, Groebner bases or by inverting the associated
Lie algebra isomorphism and computing certain exponentials explicitly. The last
method extends fully constructively for all (p,q) when used together with
Givens decompositions. The remaining methods require details of the matrix form
of the covering map, but then provide more information about the preimage. The
techniques are illustrated for (p, q)in {(2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,1)}.
