This thesis is devoted to some forefront issues in the field of leptogenesis.
After reviewing the simplest picture where flavor effects are neglected and
only the lightest right-handed neutrino contributes to the generation of
asymmetry, we discuss in detail the importance of flavor effects, the possible
relevance of quantum effects, as well as the role played by the heavier
right-handed neutrinos.
