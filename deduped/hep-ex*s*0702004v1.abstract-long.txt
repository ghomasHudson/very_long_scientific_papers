In this thesis, the first determination of the electric charge of the
top quark is presented using @xmath pb @xmath of data recorded by the
DØ detector at the Fermilab Tevatron accelerator. @xmath events are
selected with one isolated electron or muon and at least four jets out
of which two are @xmath -tagged by reconstruction of a secondary decay
vertex (SVT). The method is based on the discrimination between @xmath -
and @xmath -quark jets using a jet charge algorithm applied to
SVT-tagged jets. A method to calibrate the jet charge algorithm with
data is developed. A constrained kinematic fit is performed to associate
the @xmath bosons to the correct @xmath -quark jets in the event and
extract the top quark electric charge. The data is in good agreement
with the Standard Model top quark electric charge of @xmath . The
scenario where the selected sample is solely composed of an exotic quark
@xmath with charge @xmath is excluded at @xmath % confidence level.
Using a Bayesian approach, an upper limit on the fraction of exotic
quarks @xmath at @xmath % confidence level is obtained.
