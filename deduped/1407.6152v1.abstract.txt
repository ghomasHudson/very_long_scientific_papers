In this Thesis we examine the interplay between the encoding of information
in quantum systems and their geometrical and topological properties. We first
study photonic qubit probes of space-time curvature, showing how
gauge-independent trajectories of photons can help to perform quantum
information tasks in space. Then we introduce the first example of
topologically ordered systems constructed using interacting light modes on a
two-dimensional lattice, which paves the way for feasible observations of
topological order in bosonic systems. To conclude, motivated by a theory of
quantum gravity we analyze the convergence of entropy in unitarily inequivalent
quantization schemes.
