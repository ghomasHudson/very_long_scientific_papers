Relation extraction from text is an important task for automatic knowledge
base population. In this thesis, we first propose a syntax-focused multi-factor
attention network model for finding the relation between two entities. Next, we
propose two joint entity and relation extraction frameworks based on
encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, we propose a hierarchical entity graph
convolutional network for relation extraction across documents.
