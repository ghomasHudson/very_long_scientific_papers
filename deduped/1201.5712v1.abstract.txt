In this thesis we study early universe in the frame work of M theory. In
particular We assume that the early universe is homogeneous, anisotropic, and
is dominated by the mutually BPS 22'55' intersecting branes of M theory. We
find that, asymptotically, three spatial directions expand to infinity and the
remaining spatial directions reach stabilised values. We give a physical
description of the stabilisation mechanism.
