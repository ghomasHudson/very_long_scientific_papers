The topic of this thesis is the numerical simulation of quantum
chromodynamics including dynamical fermions. Two major problems of most
simulation algorithms that deal with dynamical fermions are (i) their
restriction to only two mass-degenerate quarks, and (ii) their
limitation to relatively heavy masses. Realistic simulations of quantum
chromodynamics, however, require the inclusion of three light dynamical
fermion flavors. It is therefore highly important to develop algorithms
which are efficient in this situation.

This thesis is focused on the implementation and the application of a
novel kind of algorithm which is expected to overcome the limitations of
older schemes. This new algorithm is named Multiboson Method. It allows
to simulate an arbitrary number of dynamical fermion flavors, which can
in principle have different masses. It will be shown that it exhibits
better scaling properties for light fermions than other methods.
Therefore, it has the potential to become the method of choice.

An explorative investigation of the parameter space of quantum
chromodynamics with three flavors finishes this work. The results may
serve as a starting point for future realistic simulations.
