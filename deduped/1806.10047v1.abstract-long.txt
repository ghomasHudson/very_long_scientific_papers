We develop a number of variants of Lifschitz realizability for @xmath by
building topological models internally in certain realizability models.
We use this to show some interesting metamathematical results about
constructive set theory with variants of @xmath including consistency
with unique Churchâ€™s thesis, consistency with some Brouwerian principles
and variants of the numerical existence property.
