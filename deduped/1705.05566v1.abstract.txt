Sensor networks can nowadays deliver 99.9% of their data with duty cycles
below 1%. This remarkable performance is, however, dependent on some important
underlying assumptions: low traffic rates, medium size densities and static
nodes. In this thesis, we investigate the performance of these same
resource-constrained devices, but under scenarios that present extreme
conditions: high traffic rates, high densities and mobility: the so-called
Extreme Wireless Sensor Networks (EWSNs).
