Both space and laboratory plasmas can be associated with static magnetic
field, and the field geometry varies from uniform to non-uniform. This thesis
investigates the impact of magnetic geometry on wave modes in cylindrical
plasmas. The cylindrical configuration is chosen so as to explore this impact
in a tractable but experimentally realisable configuration. Three magnetic
geometries are considered: uniform, focused and rippled. These studies suggest
suppressing drift waves in a uniformly magnetised plasma by increasing the
field strength, enhancing the efficiency of helicon wave production of plasma
by using a focused magnetic field, and forming a gap eigenmode on a linear
plasma device by introducing a local defect to the system's periodicity, which
is useful for understanding the gap-mode formation and interaction with
energetic particles in fusion plasmas.
